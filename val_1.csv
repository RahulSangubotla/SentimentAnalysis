0,"I read all the reviews, discounted the negative ones because of the type of praise given by the positive ones. I will have to admit that there is SOMETHING amiss in this recording or rendition! I've played it through twice now and STILL haven't heard it all, what's with the sound here? The choir had been singing 5-10 minutes before I knew there was a choir, there were previous tracks I could only faintly hear. I finally turned up the volume and started from the beginning, OUCH! Let's turn it back down! Oops, too low, let's crank 'er back up! OUCH, back down! This is the first recording, of my hundreds, that I have had this type of sound problem. You might want to consider the negative reviews."
0,"It was a fluke that I saw Hamlet w/Olivier a week before I saw this atrocity. This was the worst version of Hamlet I have ever experienced, it was like a production from my high school. I just couldn't get into it...everyone sounded as if they just arrived from deepest Ohio. Horrible! From Bill Murray to Ethan Hawke no vocal nuances, all very speechified with no feeling for the subject. So I watched half of the movie and put it out in the hall so some other sucker could experience this dreck.ginger"
0,"I like Shakespeare enough that I popped for the BBC DVD collection, and Hamlet and Henry V are my two favorite. I have seen maybe 15 different productions of Hamlet, and this is easily the one I disliked the most. If I didn't already known why Hamlet should be interested in Fortinbras, for instance, I would have to ask myself why he was even in the movie. If he did ""What of piece of work is man"", I must have dozed off. No grave digger scene? No handshake between Hamlet and Laertes before the sword fight? In fact, the entire final scene was butchered, in my opinion. Now, I'm not a purest; I've seen out of period productions of a number of plays (Macbeth, Richard III, As You Like It, A Midsummer Night's Dream) and enjoyed them. But this one is just too far out and artsy for me.You may think of Mel Gibson as Mad Max or Martin Riggs, but I think that production was a much better use of two hours. I am, of course, really waiting for Branagh's version to come out on DVD."
0,"I try to give as much credit as possible to movies, but there is none that I can give to this total piece of garbage. The pacing is intolerably sluggish, the tone of depression and angst never varies, and all the actors fail to provoke any sympathy or interest. The modernization is absurd (KING of Denmark, Inc.!) and the ever greasy Ethan Hawke turns what is arguably Western drama's most fascinating and complex character into a one dimensional, Kurt Cobain clone. This film could have said something interesting about corporate America (the Bard meets Wall Street) but instead all we get is a lot of flashy, half baked, wannabe post-modernism. Save your money and watch ANY film version of Hamlet but this one."
0,"This is the worst performance I have so far seen of Hamlet, my favorite of Shakespeare's plays. Compared to the sterling quality of the Kenneth Brannagh production, which breathes brilliant life into the characters, this effort is like a stinking wind off the East River. Not recommended!!!"
0,"If someone asks you for a cookie, you're going to think they want a boat hook...If someone happens to give you this dictionary for free, your best bet is to use it for starting fires. Buy a Gummerus."
0,"Unless you are unaware of what has been going on in the past many decades, this video will provide you with no new information. There are no new ""predictions"", no solutions, as well as no answers to any of the questions the unseen announcer poses from time to time. The cover of the DVD asks the question ""Can this man predict when your world will crumble?"". No - of course not. He does not even try He does review problems of the past and tells us of the collapse of the dollar and organized society, but not when or even the stages. We have endless blacked out screens between his ""profound"" comments. Quotes from reviews on the back of the DVD include ""superb, hypnotic and haunting"". It is none of these. Do not waste your money on this over hyped video."
0,"I cannot believe this film was made, and that people rate this four stars on average is shocking. Sure the topic is interesting and relevant, but the guy is sitting there talking about how we're spending billions on the oil thats not there while he makes a couple million talking about what other credible experts have said. Im sorry, but I do not recommend this to anyone."
0,He thinks he is some special person with the CIA always trying to recruit him. How do we know this is true?
0,"As soon as I seen his ""thorough"" investigation of Nuclear energy and some of his other grandpa ideas I quit watching. Poor research and fear mongering at its finest. I am sure he makes some good points but not worth it."
0,"Why are people fascinated with collapse anxiety? In answering this question the documentary actually does a pretty good job. It documents its subject as being self destructive, self indulgent, scatter brained, manic, unable to maintain employment, unable to maintain relationships, pay bills, etc. Of course he assumes the rest of the world is the same as him and ready to collapse.As far as presenting any intelligent theory on how the western world is about to collapse, it fails terribly.His arguments essentially boil down to scan the news for data that validates and reinforces your opinion (bad news). Then remind everyone that you have been warning about collapse since 1985-- and apparently failed to see all the global growth and benefits that humans have realized since then.Watching this DVD left me feeling pretty optimistic."
0,"Let me add my 2 (for 2 stars). The pictures are great, only it would have been nice to know WHO the pictures were of. I thought it would be a 100 year history, but I was wrong. What they wrote about was informative, heart-tugging and interesting. There just wasn't enough of it to justify the subtitle ""100 years. The Official Retrospective."""
0,"I am extremly disappointed with my purchase. I do not recommend this product to anyone. I am also very disappointed with the seller who sent me a used product as a new product. I have been trying to get a refund, but he has been giving me grief and run around and trying to presnt his faulty product as a good product."
0,"Had it for 2 weeks. Used pliers to loosen a hand-tightened door stop, and the tool literally broke in half. I barely applied pressure...I've sent it back for replacement (leatherman warranties tools for 25 years). Hopefully it was a defect. We'll see.It is very snazzy, though. Looks great, nice weight and balance, very sharp blade. Aesthetically, it's top-notch."
0,"Don't waste your money. More than half of this little paperback book is exercises. I was astounded to find a little card in the book asking me to send $3.50 to obtain the answers to the exercises!! After paying $20.00 for a book that is clearly overpriced. If you want a textbook, look at one of the many others that are better and have better prices -- and include the exercise answers."
0,"I read reviews on this trap and was excited to give it a try. I placed and set the trap as described, but was very disaapointed with the results. The gopher unbelievably was able to defeat the trap many times, packing the trap with dirt but not setting it off and being killed as descibed by the manufacturer. The spring on the trap is too week, and the trigger is of poor material/design. I'd stick to the ""Vitor"" brand black box, as it works good on gophers not experianced with trapping techniques. I finally decided to hook a metal dryer vent tube up to my cars exhaust pipe, ran the other end of the pipe down the hole, let the car idle for a while, and killed em dead."
0,Not worth the trouble of filling & cleaning up. Much easier to buy reg. olive oil cooking spray. I will try to heed my on advice in the future.
0,"The Misto Gourmet Olive Oil Sprayer spayed well for a few months. Then the spray turned into just a stream of oil. The first few times, just cleaning out the nozzle fixed the problem. After that, it couldn't be fixed. I bought it because my Pampered Chef one melted next to the stove, but they are really expensive. Maybe you really do ""get what you pay for."""
0,"Although the brushed aluminum body is very stylish, the product parts are incredibly cheap. The sprayer works by creating air pressure in an internal canister as you pump the cover, which allows you to spray oil as a mist. Unfortunately, the plastic tube, which is supposed to force air into the nozzle, is so flimsy that this product broke almost immediately. It is no longer able to force air into the spray nozzle, so it cannot spray a mist.I would recommend trying a different brand. It may cost a little more, but you get what you pay for."
0,"So Misto promises to replace expensive store-bought aerosol cans with a product that will spray a fine mist of oil just like they do, but for only (in the long-term, anyway) pennies a can.HA!!I followed the directions verbatim, but no matter what kind of oil I tried... corn, canola, olive..., and no matter how much I pumped it up, all it would do is dribble out a pathetic stream.Possibly the most undeservedly-hyped product I've ever fallen for... should be ZERO stars!"
0,"Truly see this as useless, and not able to do what it's advertised to do. It pumps and sprays but the oil doesn't keep things from sticking."
0,"Like many other 1 & 2 star reviewers, my misto worked for about a week or two. Now, it just sprays jets of oil, no matter how much (or how little) it's pumped. Cleaning it has not helped. Total waste of money."
0,"I tried it this morning. I get lots of small drippy spurts followed by a burst of air. Still trying to see if something is clogged, if I have it too full, or if there is some other form of operator error. I want this to work!"
0,"Not the best. I had to really cram down on the spout to get a spray, otherwise it was just a single line of oil coming out no matter how much or little I pumped. After about a week, the plunger tore and it is now useless."
0,I bought this sprayer as a Christmas present and the person used it only 2 times and the white screw cap inside that holds the spray mechanism in place broke. It seems that this is a faulty part of the sprayer. I would like to know if I could get a replacement part for it. I was very disapointed in this product due to it breaking.
0,"I heeded the reviews of others, to no avail. It doesn't matter if you release the pressure after each use, the spray nozzle will fail eventually. In my case, it failed after about six weeks of once-daily use. It's a pretty piece of junk, that's all."
0,This is great in theory but it clogged up after a few uses and didn't produce an even spray. Not really worth the money.
0,"They were junk from the word ""go"". Unpacked them from a two-pack, and that took about 10 minutes. Then it took about another 10+ minutes to get the glue off (they were glued inside the pack). Just as I got the glue off the first, I opened the container and looked inside. The smell was a strong plastic smell that has to affect the olive oil taste. BPA free? Don't know, because the packaging does not mention that. After reading the other reviews, I am passing on this item and returning it.Misto Gourmet Olive Oil Sprayer, Brushed Aluminum"
0,I give up. I've gone through 4 of these now. They work great... until the top gets pulled off rendering it unable to be pumped and therefore useless. Hope they fix this design flaw.
0,"It's not aluminum. When I got it this morning. There was a bit long black mark on the cap. So I have tried to remove it. Since I thought it's aluminum, I use some of magic eraser to erase the black mark.Unfortunately, that wasn't mark but big scratch.Inside of aluminum feel plastic cap is black. so when I use my magic eraser, it shows the inside of cap very clearly. now the cap has smudged black mark on it.I really feel sorry I cannot upload the pictures. I wish the review window have function to upload pictures."
0,"I purchased a Misto and--like many other reviewers--it worked great the first five or so times. Then it started spluttering and spitting out a stream of oil, if anything at all, despite the fact that it was practically new. I doubled checked everything: it wasn't too full, I hadn't over-pumped it, etc. Ultimately, it seemed like some kind of gasket in the interior pump mechanism had busted, as it was partially full of oil.Later, I found another model on sale for a few dollars and I decided to give it another try. Mine was probably just faulty, right? WRONG! Within three uses, the same old routine started again. I won't be investing in one of these wastes of time and money again."
0,"I loved this product when I first got it, it worked wonderfully and I thought ""why spend 2.99 per spray can, when I can buy a misto once?"" Well, for the two months it actually worked, I don't think I got my money's worth. Now it just shoots a stream of oil no matter how much i pressurize it. I've tried cleaning it several times, even soaking it overnight, to no avail."
0,"This is one of those items that seem really great and are purchased to replace disposable counterparts. We bought two of these thinking that we would never have to buy non-stick cooking spray again and that they would last for a long time. Not the case here.They both worked fine at first, and then after a few months the spray became a stream, and then a slow trickle. We followed the cleaning instructions and it improved a small amount, but they were never functioning like new.After another few months, the silver coloring on the lid started to rub off and even after pumping the bottles and cleaning again, the only thing they would do was sort of spit the oil out at random intervals.They sat in my cupboard and were raraly used for about a year after that and then, suddenly, one malfunctioned and started oozing oil into my cabinet. That was it for us and both ended up in the trash. Now we are back to buying nonstick spray at the grocery store again."
0,"It broken, and I opened it.Eventually I found the spring is plastic!!!so I cut off the broken spring and chenged a metallic spring ~~~It just works....So, if you do not want to fix something ,you'd better do not buy this one......"
0,"I'll be quick; it leaks like you would not believe!What a great idea, but cheap components make it worthless. Ours leaked within a few weeks and the retailor refused to take it back. Save yourself some time and frustration and just throw a $20 bill in your trash - it's quicker and less harmful to our environment. Or better yet, keep the $20 in your pocket and pass on this all together."
0,"The object is badly and cheaply realized. I already shared an image where is possible to see the internal plastic part of the cap that came-off at the second pumps.Another problem is that part of the oil is 'sprayed too thin', more then spray it you atomize it, so that the atomized part is too 'light' and 'stay in the air' instead pf your food, and eventually fall off the dish and you can even breathe it!I had one I bought in Italy that was half the price of that one but worked well for 2 years, so no excuses, that works wrongly because it is cheap, cheaply done not cheap in price."
0,"Recently received this as a gift. When I initially cleaned it with water, I followed cleaning directions and got a nice mist of water, then when I filled it half-way with grapeseed oil it didn't work at all.I will follow one of the other posts that suggest rinsing in hot water. If this does not work I will try to return it! I cannot believe I didn't even get a single good use from it.It is a great idea though, if it only worked."
0,Dona BarbaraUnable to review. DVD was spolied for the second time and I had to return it.
0,"Upon reciept of the book I was immediatly dissapointed to have found what appeared to be more of a comic book than an actual book about this legendary story. With an average of about 10-15 words per page I did not find it a satisfying read. Also it seems they tried to use direct quotes from the movie, but often forgot key parts, such as when King Leonitus meets his ally in the mountains, he asks him why he brought so few soldiers; in the movie. In the book they leave out the word soldiers which is the key point Leonidus is making, saying he has brought more soldiers than he, but they include every single person that he asks their profession, the sculpter, potter, blacksmith etc. Flipping through though, I did find that it held a vast assorment of drawings from the artist, some quite detailed and gory which I believe makes up for a completely poor book, so I give it a 2 out of 5 stars."
0,"A truly awesome telling of this story is ""Gates of Fire, an epic novel of the Battle of thermopylae"", by Steven Pressfield. A truly awesome book, and the original which was ripped off by Hollywood insider Frank Miller."
0,"I hate to rate this one so low, mainly because it was my fault for not looking inside the book before purchasing it. I didn't realize it was all cartoons. A good book for young boys. Gates of Fire is a better book for the novel."
0,"I recently purchased a tyco rc rewinder and my son lost the transmitor. the problem is tyco does not have a transmitor for me to purchase, now i am out $100 and my son can not play with his birthday present. If you purchase any of the tyco(mattel) remote control cars, make sure you can purchase replacements if needed or your purchase is worthless."
0,"I just find it disgarceful to write a tell all book about someone that isn't around to defend thmself and tell their side of the story. Is this book fiction or nonfiction? Who really knows, it is distasteful however."
0,"I loved my first trager backpack. After many years of use it eventually came apart at the seams. I liked it so much, that I bought another. The same thing happened, the seams came apart, but this time it happened almost immediately. I contacted Trager and they asked me to send it in for repair or replacement. I did this. Then I NEVER heard back from them again. I have emailed, called and left VMs and tried everything. They have never responded to me. I now have to buy something else as I have been without the bag I was using every day. I will not buy another Trager product."
0,"Usually we are very impressed with Crayola art products, but these paints were definitely an exception. The primary reason I bought them was because they were washable, and I've never had a problem with removing Crayola products from clothes, rugs, etc. With that said, these paints are definitely washable, but at a cost. The paint is a very thick texture, similar to hair gel. My daughter doesn't mind using her hands to paint with it, but my 21 month old son can't stand having it on his hands. The texture makes it very difficult to make any shapes beyond smudges. The color is very watered down and faint, no matter what type of paper you use. The end result is a very muddy mess. Since it's so thick, it takes quite a while to dry on paper. My hope was for the kids to create some art projects we could hang on the wall, but these paints definitely wouldn't be ""wall worthy."""
0,"This book pointed out a lots of general mistakes that parents may make. It is useful to know all of these aspects that parents should pay attention. But the authors made me feel that I am already a bad parent, and I need to be taught as a child. That makes me feel irritated."
0,"This is the 2nd or 3rd book I have read by this author and I have to say I will not try her again. I have to agree with the 1 review that I thought it was boring, not much going on til the very end and I had to push myself to read to the end hoping that it was going to get better. It did not. I saw all the glowing reviews and I thought I would try it. Not much happened way into the story. It could have been so much better using the plot where the hero tries to find out more about the author of the book society is conflicted about. That would have made it a little more exciting! Instead both the hero and the heroine go round and round about their feelings and the story doesn't go anywhere. Pretty blah."
0,"Beware the Amazon tickler ""Customers who bought this item also bought..."" When I saw that, I naturally thought the Rat Tale would work with my Rat Zapper. Wrong! I bought a brand new Rat Zapper and a Rat Tale to go with it. Lo and behold, when I unpacked my purchases, I found that the Rat Tale only works with Rat Zapper Ultra - which is NOT the one I bought. ""Just return it"" you might say? Well, the Rat Tale itself cost only $11.99. But with shipping it was closer to $20. With some investigation, I discovered that the seller charges a restocking fee. So if I return it and pay for THAT shipping and then pay for a restocking fee on top of that, I'd just be throwing away good money after bad. Not worth the hassle. So if you buy a Rat Zapper, be SURE you have the right model before you purchase this Rat Tale."
0,I got Snuggli and Bjorn for my baby shower. I was planning on returning Bjorn to get my big $$$ back. But Snuggli was so difficult to use with all those straps and belts that my impatient baby had a fit every time. Baby Bjorn worked better.
0,"I have one of these snuglis and wouldn't recommend it to someone shopping for a carrier. It worked nicely in the beginning, when our son was tiny, but now that he is about 17 pounds (at 4 months), it is cutting off the circulation in his legs and not comfortable on me. I am also not a fan of the way you get the child into the carrier, and in fact scratched my son's tummy on the plastic piece where the peg slides in (talk about feeling like a horrible mom!) while trying to get him into position. I am now researching Baby Bjorns because I'd like a secure way to carry him around - it is fun to be able to carry him on walks sometimes, and in the grocery store it's really convenient. If you're shopping for a carrier, I'd recommend you keep looking."
0,"This is the only toy my 5 year old son begged for this year for Christmas. I don't have a lot of money as I am a single parent, but I saved up and spent the $90 for the Terrain Twister and the battery pack that AMAZON said was required! Christmas morning we discovered that it was the wrong battery pack!!! My son was so disappointed. I told him I would buy the right pack and I did after 2 weeks of searching the stores...What a waste, the twister still is pretty much useless! It only works for about 5 minutes and then stops and it does not work at all in snow! My son is so disappointed and keeps saying he can't believe Santa would make such a junk toy!!! Shame on Tyco for ripping parents off and disappointing the kids (and the parents) and shame on Amazon for making such a big blunder in recommending the wrong pack!"
0,"Which one is better or is there even a difference? The red terrain twister with 27MHz or the green 49MHz? Is the green one more powerful. Are the MHz's like a measurement of power in some sort of batttery. And another question, do you have to buy a battery and charger seperately because i saw a review that said his son bought it and he had to buy the battery seperately. Please respond with the title Which is better?"
0,"Condorman was a movie where Disney tried and failed to do a spoof properly. Neither good enough for kids or adults, the book suffers because of that, and having to be kid accessible.A cartoonist gets involved with spies and a silly spy plot by virtue of a friend, and ends up bringing one of his own outlandish characters to life."
0,"This product seemed to work for one night with our raccoon that adopted our backyard as its poop station. Used it all up over the next few nights but never got any further results. Instead we placed a lamp to shine a light on the area most used by the raccoon - which was an area that was very dark at night. It worked immediately, and the raccoon has never returned (months later)."
0,"This book was terrible. I had a hard time reading it, and that has never happened to me before. The language used made even me disgusted and proved how small the vocabulary is of Walter Dean Myers. It is about a soldier in Nam, named Richie Perry. Perry disgusted me because he becomes friends with the stupidest, most foul mouthed hick I have ever heard of. This red-neck was named Pee-Wee, a war-monger. I hated it."
0,"The author knows very little about Viet Nam or the army. He apparently thinks the 60 in M-60 stands for .60 cal. and that soldiers put stamps on their letters when they were in the war zone. A patrol goes out without a radio, a soldier calls a latrine a ""bathroom,"" and the final bit of silliness---soldiers fly back to the states not on a jet transport, nor on a C-130, but on a C-47, a two-engine prop job built in the 1930s and never used in the Viet Nam War to fly across the Pacific.If Myers paid a vet to check the book for inaccuracies, he did not spend his money well.Because of the dialogue, the book's subtitle could be The Little Rascals Go To War. Soldiers' talk in this book is often too cute. For those who like mildly homoerotic war stories that little reflect the way things are, this book might be for you."
0,"Cologne does not smell like the usual Jordan cologne I have purchased the last few years. It smells more like cleaning solution. It is a rip-off that we cannot return these kinds of items. The ""cologne"" could have been filled with just water, and I would not get a refund.What is strange is I have bought this product before in the past and it smelled just fine. I'm guessing their supplier must have changed."
0,"When i finally decided to sit down and watch this movie i realized at the end what a waste of time. This movie was sooo disapointing all the way, sure is was a beautiful story, but half of the movie did not make sense, i mean come on! first, the so call limbo is just plain rediculous, second the way the murderer died is stupid, third i thought the dead girl was going to do more than what she did to bring justice to her death instead of just sitting up there on her cloud (so to speak) so basically like all the other reviewers that gave this movie a one star is right, this movie was seriously lacking."
0,"A large portion of the book was not in the movie at all. If I didn't read the book first, I wouldn't have understood it at all."
0,"This is a weak effort. Sure her lyrics are pretty good (hence the second star) but the high school talent show guitar playing and her countryish voice are not getting it done. I couldn't pay attention to one song long enough to remember it. While riding in the car trying to listen to this my mind wandered everywhere and I looked doen and thought, track 12, already? I know that this makes some of you psuedo-intellectuals feel ""smart"" when you listen to it, but I suggest you take a course in Differential Equations for that. I love ""Who Will Save Your Soul"", and wait for an album that sounds like that song, but until then I'm going to pick on my wife for buying this for me for Christmas (I could have gotten the Partridge Family's Greatest Hits cheaper)."
0,"This album reminds me a lot of the Blondie song ""Sunday Girl"", except that THIS album is so soaked in new-age schlock it just kind of sits there. And Jewel takes herself SO seriously. She could use a little humor on this album and less of the I'm Okay/You're Okay dynamics. What I liked about her first album was the mix of Storytelling like on ""Adrian"" and ""Daddy"" and the silliness of the likes of ""I'm sensitive"" and ""Morning Song."" When she did take herself seriously before, it was with the socially-aware and in-your-face ""Pieces of You."" But, on the new album, it's all just blah. ""Hands"" is a mind-numbingly generic bit of strumming with a mind-numbingly annoying moral pasted over the top of it. Everything else is just more of the same. Somebody needs to introduce this woman to the heroine of Blondie's ""X-Offender."" Now that was rush!"
0,"This cd is so depressing. It makes you feel like shooting yourself. If it were up to me, I would have it removed from the market because it is probably the cause of many suicides."
0,"I love Jewel's voice...her CD was disappointing. I felt like I was listening to ONE LONG LONG ballad of a song. There was no diversity in her lyrics and melody -- no true distinct character in each of the songs. The same simple message, ""Love yourself. Don't worry."" Which is nice, BUT I think we got the point. Any case, I felt as though she was hurried and pressured by the media execs and the capitalistic society to bring in another 10 ten hit. I love her and I know she can do a lot better."
0,"Jewel tried for a very creative group of songs on this CD but all that she ended up with is a bunch of whiny tunes that go nowhere. Her hit ""Hands"" which was aired on radio stations before this CD came out was supposed to boost sales of this CD, because obviously putting it on the rack alone, with no help was not enough. Jewel has also sold many copies of her book, and she has become the best paid female writer out there! Obviously there are people who haven't read any of Emily Dickinson's work, or Charlotte Bronte's. The songs on this CD are all the same; it's Jewel lamenting about her life in a car, and her boy who left her. There is so much more out there. Take it from a music fanatic, this CD won't ""Save your Soul""..."
0,"Jewel is nice, but this work bores me. I prefer her live performances. Look up ""Satellite"" sometime to hear her power and amazing voice."
0,"Okay, maybe not painfully bad, but certainly bland, boring, and unimportant. After being forced to listen to both CDs and numerous bootlegged live recordings I have come to realize that Jewel is the pop-consumer equivalent to Tori Amos. Yet again, record labels prove their savvy by tracking down someone who can pass as a semi-clone to a true artist, goose them up, dumb them down and then present said commodity to the masses.Jewel is just another example of what people will buy if it comes their way. Certainly not harmful, but hardly substantive."
0,"I have great respect for artists who can write and perform their own music. Jewel is a beautiful woman with a beautiful voice, but with these trite lyrics and melodies she should really get some assistance with her writing. I'd like to hear a song by her called ""Screw You All! I Used to Live in a Car!"" or something to break the monotony of her ""cheerfully spiritual"" lyrics. There are some pleasant tunes on this album, but nothing that you can distinguish from anything she's done on this album or her last. I'd love to hear her do some covers of old tunes like ""Natural Woman,"" ""Just One Look,"" etc. Maybe she should team with Layne Staley from Alice in Chains. That would be some pairing and we can get some less perky lyrics. ""Down in a Hole With Jewel."" Actually that would be a rather cheerful experience for me. Never mind...Having said all that, this album will probably sell like hotcakes and please hardcore Jewel fans. I think she is capable of much more."
0,"As others have commented, the NTSC side of this DVD is non-playable. I tried it in two DVD players and they refused to play it. I then tried it in my PC, and only the PAL side of the DVD works. The NTSC side contains nothing but the color test bars you see when a TV station is off the air. I think Amazon has got a batch of bad DVDs here.I'd really like to have this DVD for my daughter who loves ballet - and from viewing the PAL side of the DVD, the picture quality and sound appear superb. Giving it 1 star solely because the DVD was defective."
0,"This hose is, unfortunately, very smelly. It works OK, though sometimes the lock while pulling out the hose doesn't engage, which can be frustrating. But the smell is very rough. I left it unwound in my shop for 3 months, hoping the smell would dissipate, but it has not. The hose still reeks.I will probably throw it away and buy something else."
0,"I initially liked that the dryer was small and lightweight; however, after very few uses the handle broke open and I was left holding a handful of wiring. To make matters worse, this seller has ignored both my email request for help and the one Amazon forwarded to them. Buy another brand from another seller!"
0,"At first glance, it may seem like a hard SF reformulation of Star Trek. Then you realize the tachyon beams, warp speed, subspace disturbances, ... pseudo-science, and deus ex machina-based plots of Star Trek are actually better than this piece of junk.Sawyer attempts to create a grand space opera and in the process falls flat on his face. The science is miserable, in the league of such travesties as the aforementioned Star Trek: Voyager. It seems like Sawyer read a book on theoretical physics and completely misunderstood it. E.E. Smith's space operas seem like hard SF compared to this.Aside from the ludicrous science, the book is terrible. The characters are flat and one-dimensional, particularly the lead. The protagonist is constantly whining and more than a little annoying, and as a result the reader cares little for him. The plot is trite and predictable, and has been done dozens of times before.In short, avoid it like the plague."
0,"Boring, juvenile, absurd...the list goes on and on. Reads like an el cheapo ripoff of Star Trek. Particularly moronic are the aliens."
0,I found absolutely no challenge inthis stupid game at all. Itis beneath me. What a waste of time and money. This game is Garb-aaaaaggggeeee!!!
0,"There are times in the book that I found the author's tone very condesending and male-oriented. He really does talk down to readers. Also, the million dollars he says that a person can save is a nice idea, but very hard to accomplish in the real world. What David does not say is that a million dollars today will be worth a fraction of that by the time most of us retire decades from now. This book is all about sales and marketing, instead of solid financial advice."
0,"I was disappointed by the lack of depth of advice. Basically, he recommends contributing to your 401k; buying a house and paying your mortgage down by making bi-weekly payments, automatically deducted from your account; and paying down your debt by have payments automatically deducted from your account. If you have any fiscal sense at all, you are already doing most things recommended in this book. If you are a novice at finances, you might find it slightly helpful."
0,- Automatically pay towards your 401k- Automatically pay off your debt- Automatically pay your mortgage (faster)That's about it. Save yourself the read.
0,"I have read many books of this type. I was very disappointed in this book. It merely reiterates the time old adages of: pay your self first; pay off your credit cards; pay down your mortgage; and buy one coffee a day, instead of two.In my opinion, it is only a watered-down version of ""The Wealthy Barber"". The ideas in ""The Automatic Millionaire"" are solid advice, but have been written many times in many other books. Unfortunately I found no new ideas in the book, nor were there many helpful suggestions that could have been mentioned.This book might be helpful to someone just entering the workforce who has very little financial knowledge.Andrew"
0,"This book took me about 2 hours to read. It was light on substance.. The couple he uses as an example of ""Automatic Millionaires"" seemed made up, I do not know if they are supposed to be real, never the less - they seemed fake. While the book gave some good advice -- it was VERY basic and didn't say anything earth shattering.. The theme of the book was...SAVE your money (401k).. INVEST your money, BUY a HOUSE.. and DO NOT WASTE your money on Coffee ... Stay out of Debt and use ""automatic payments"" to do everything!...While the book gives good advice, it does not go into detail on much...to me it was just basic advice the most people should knowIt was a let down for me."
0,"I, too, was part of the Bach 100 and did his coaching program. I found the book and the program virtually useless. Like many others have said, this information is very basic and most of us are probably doing all of what he suggests already. The chances of my being a millionaire have not been increased since reading the book and doing the program. He says ' you will always be poor without homeownership' But, gives little advice on how to own a home with little or no downpayment. Someone should write a GOOD book on this topic for those of us who live and work areas with exceeding real estate prices and are caught in the 'rent trap!'"
0,"From a 2010 perspective, this movie seems incredibly simplistic and predictable - its main entertainment value, if any, is as camp comedy. The plot ""tension"" is laughable. I (and half a dozen friends) are very sorry that I picked this one from a pile of seven DVDs including Apocalypse Now and Zorba the Greek - both of which I have yet to see.Upon reflection, this movie reminded me of Hawaii Five O or the original Star Trek, in that they were great fun for a kid, but when nostalgia prompts a re-watching, they don't compare well to modern, more sophisticated fare.Some of the classics still are great. If you really are in the mood for a submarine movie, watch Das Boot (subtitled, not dubbed). Outstanding."
0,"As I am researching Carole King for a scholarly paper, I ordered this book hoping there would be an introduction or preface with some history or information on her. Alas, there were only the song lyrics and music for piano and guitar--nothing else. Presentation of each song offers a page with the lyrics in poetry form preceding the sheet music which includes lyrics and music. I gave it a 1-star rating only because it didn't suit my purpose. I am sure anyone wanting just the sheet music for ""Tapestry"" would be very happy with it. Hopefully, I will find time to tackle learning to play her wonderful music once the paper is finished."

0,"Thanks Mrs. Farmer for the review title. And thank you Mr. Johnson for this gravel heaving display of school yard one-upsmanship. Seriously, could your dad beat up Rousseau's? I'll bet he could, huh?It's books like this that make me wish I could give less than one star."
0,"Paul Johnson...let us consider Paul Johnson. Long before the former editor of The Newstatesman had his Road to Damascus conversion, he must have realised that his true calling in life was to be a rather tiresome and bigoted polemicist, attempting to pass himself off as a historian. During his stagger from Left to Right, a ferocious resentment and jealousy of better minds than his seems to have sustained him. And hey ho, now he produces a squalid little polemic against the ""Left"" as his revenge. Satre was a pevert? Marx was given to drinking? Well darn, if a thinker is motivated by conservative or secular impulses, then that at once exempts them from the hatchet job. Intellectuals is the work of a bitter and mediocre man. Sure it is subtle, but it carries the same logic of hating the thinker, the humanist, she or he who scorns aboriginal predjudices and reaction. Johnson's charalatanism goes along the road that ends with books being tossed on bonfires."
0,"The workout itself was ok. I like how it showed different moves and how it didn't put too much pressure on you to be able to do so much at the beginning, but Bethenny just wouldn't stop talking. It got to the point where it was just annoying to listen to her. I wouldn't do the workout again."

0,"I bought this book for my 2 1/2-year-old twins, but a lot of it goes over their heads. Obviously the author has talent, but she's more of a poet than a storyteller. Perhaps she should be targeting an older crowd. This book has elements suited for toddlers (big pictures, only one sentence per page) but the writing is too sophisiticated and abstract for them, and the story too disjointed. I guess it would be good for a one-year-old or younger who just enjoys hearing a parent read a peaceful book (e.g., ""Eyes close. There is a drowsy hush. Darkness swells into a colorful dream. And if the moon could talk...""). But my kids prefer books with stories they can understand, and even repeat. This ain't that."
0,"I received this as a shower gift. I've used it many times. I discovered that I really love to wear my baby as opposed to pushing her around in the stroller. It's so nice to be able to ""hold"" her when she is upset and still have my hands free to do other things, like housework or cooking dinner. I have several different baby carriers ranging from the snugli to ring slings. My feelings on the snugli are this...It doesn't have any sort of back support and after a good hour or so of wearing my baby in the snugli, my back and neck are screaming. I've read that the snugli is bad for baby's hips, too, so that doesn't make me feel to great about it. I recently borrowed the BEST carrier from a friend, it's called and ERGO baby carrier. It is the best thing ever invented!!!!! It is soft and supports my back and neck, ugh, I could go on and on and on. I say, skip the cheesy snugli and invest in an ERGO!!!"
0,"Bought the whole set plus extra senors, and have had nothing but trouble with this set. One of the sensors stopped working one week later, the remote has never worked at all, and the emergency dialer stopped working after eight months, I have called customer support twice and they have not been able to help me at all. I would not recommend this unit to anyone."
0,Installation was extremely easy. The provided double-sided tapes installing the the sensors an easy task. The keypad which includes the siren died after only about 4 months of use. The siren simply died and would no longer work.
0,"I purchased this based on Amazon reviews. It works in theory but not practice. Its main downfall is the range that the sensors can communicate with the main keypad. Put a wall in the way and no joy. So unless you live in a one room apartment or only want to secure part of your living space - don't bother with this. The manufacturers support operation is pretty non existent. I have since gone with a used ADT system (without the monthly monitoring), a generic dialer and generic sensor that picks up the ADT chime sound."
0,"First, let me start by saying that I do order quite frequently from Amazon and the reviews are always a huge help. My husband and I decided to purchase this unit b/c of the reviews.My husband worked on the unit for a week and could not get the dialer and the alarm to work in sync. When he called the customer service number, twice he left a message and no one called him back. On the third time, he got a rep but she informed him that they were about to close and could not help him troubleshoot. I rated the unit a 1 because of the product and the absolutely horrible customer service."
0,The product lasted for only about 5-6months. it has started giving issues & their support team just makes me go over the reset steps again and again without trying to understand that the product is not functioning properly.
0,"Monica Mancini seems to have a beautiful voice that will please the listener. I feel like she is on the way to a wonderful career in music.For this project Monica elected to sing some of her fathers evergreens. This is not a bad idea! Henry wrote many wonderful tunes over his hughly successful career. The only draw back I have about this cd is that on some of the songs I didn't think the arrangement was very well crafted. Also on the song ""Dreamsville"" Monica decided to sing this song as a duet with Johnny Mathis. I didn't like that duet.I think it is fair to say that this is a cd worthy of your purchase."
0,"Another dumb movie, it has like two good scenes, its just another one of those movies that you wish you could've just watch the preview which happens to have the only good parts of the movie, just for dumb kids to watch, i think directors should come with better scrips"
0,"This wasn't a movie, this was 88 minutes of wasted time. I cant believe the amount of positive reviews this got, unbelievable. John Hughes & this thing should never be in the same sentence. Comparing John's work to Nima Nourizadeh is disrespectful and disgraceful to J.Hughes fans throughout. Warner Bros. should be embarrassed for releasing this stuff under their name. Blind buyers beware, rent first! It wouldn't surprise me to see this in the $1 bin very soon, and even then, it's overpriced."
0,"As another reviewer mentioned, this unit is not recognized by my computer if I plug it in through a USB extension cord. It is very strange because the unit works fine if plugged directly into the computer. Other 2.0 deviced work fine through the same extension cord this was attempted with.Summary:Short cord, extension cables may not work... purchase a different brand."

0,"Hey There Hanson Fanz! Trust me, don't waste your money on this book! I bought it and it was such a waste! So much false info, and pix everyone's seen like when Hanson performed on the Today Show in New York City! It just has all the same old boring info in it like how Hanson got started etc. etc. It's also REALLY short. I know I may be kinda hard on the author because it's a unauthorized book, but still! Matt needs to do some HANSON HOMEWORK!P.S. Buy the book ""Zac Attack! Hanson's Little Brother"". It was so good, that I couldn't put it down and it seemed like the author interviewed Zac herself!"

0,"Totally disorganized. If you want to travel in Brisbane, you have to look in 6 different sections to get all the different information about Brisbane. The walking tour on pp 228-229 has each of the places numbered and refers to a map on page 102 that has no numbers. And doesn't even show all the places listed in the walking tour. No legend on the map so you have to ""know"" that the red dots are Queensland Railway stations. Save your money and frustration. Do not buy this book."
0,I don't even know why I ordered this. Perhaps because of some good reviews. But I just don't get it. Not funny. Not useful. Just a waste of money. Let me save you some money by giving you a way to annoy people: Pick you nose in public. All the book is not this tastless but just as useless.
0,"I agree that this release was completely pointless... I guess I bought it for the cool looking photo on the front and that's about it. At least when I bought the Complete Studio Recordings I could justify owning two copies of every album because the CSR tracks were remastered and did sound slightly better. But, with no remixes, no remasters, and nothing new, I don't know why they put this record out; I think we can all agree the release of the Royal Albert Hall '70 or Earls Court '75, or Seattle '77 or ... etc. would have been much better. Page et al need to get their act together and release more live material."
0,"How many more repackaged ""Best of"" CDs will Led Zeppelin release? The music is incredible, but why treat their fans as brainless cattle?

0,"Don't be a cheapo, buy the original albums! If you buy only this CD you're missing out on sooooo much. The real 'Best of Led Zeppelin' collection is the Complete Studio Recordings box set. I give this more than one star only because the songs are so damn good."
0,"Well, everything that I'm NOW reading is true. The sand that I just removed from the sandbox was green and full of leaves and bugs. The digger is nearly impossible to use. Honestly, this was just a breeding ground for mosquitos..with all of the standing water...in the sand...in the dumptruck ..and in the digger.I'm sorry I wasted the money."
0,"I was extremely disappointed with this toy. My children, ages 4 and 6 1/2 had a difficult time using the digging arm and the sand always got wet when it rain and would puddle in the sandbox. When I approached this issue with the company, I was advised to ""drill holes in the bottom"" so that the water would drain. In addition a part on the digging arm broke with very little use. I do not recommend this toy."
0,My mother bought this sand box for my two boys last week and the sand is already ruined. Rain got in it along with some ants and some kind of clover started growing in it. It was terrable!! ... What a waste of time!!
0,this is the most poorly made little tikes toy i have ever seen. the lid doesn't seel so it fills with water the crane doesn't work correctly so it is very frustrating to use it is made out of very thin plastic
0,The lid is very flimsy! It can barely hold a truck full of sand. The crane is hard to use because it gets sand in the mechanism. It is overpriced.
0,"We bought this sandbox for our four year old son expecting him to have an awesome time with it. The bucket on the crane does not fully extend, actually doesn't extend at all because the plastic parts get stuck on each other. We were sent replacement parts that did not fix the problem. The other problem is water collects in the sandbox and algae grows. Three months have passed and our son has yet to be able to play with this sandbox. It is a huge waste of money."
0,I agree witht the majority of the other reviews. The poor fitting lid allows not only water but large numbers of bugs and leaves to accumulate in the sand box.The lid is suppose to also function as a road when place beside the sandbox but if my children (ages 1 and 5) put any pressure on it while driving the trucks up the lid buckles. As a result the lid is developing cracks from the buckling. The shovel (which seemed like the most appealing part of the sand box) is impossible for my 5 year old to operate. I attempted to use the shovel this summer and it broke into two sharp and jagged plastic pieces. This was a HUGE waste of money and disappointment.
0,"Took this product for a full month. It didn't help me to maintain the levels of candida that I was able to with other products. I hate paying for Candex, but it's the better product."
0,"This book starts off on the premise that 1) companies can manipulate eps but not cashflow and 2) rather than engage in all sorts of scenario analysis, look at the securities price and determine what growth rate this implies for sales etc.Great start, but they then begin a long discussion that basically involves stock selection. Now, i though they spent the first 50 pages of the book saying that stock selection and analyst engaged in this activity are swimming upstream...Very dissappointing. Another ""How to Pick 'em"" book."
0,"We bought this for our 2 1/2 year old for Christmas. He played with it a few times the first couple of weeks but has not touched it since.It does not seem as sturdy as our other Fisher-Price toys, although it has not broken, probably because it is not getting any use.He really loves the FisherPrice figure-8, motorized track - although it got so-so reviews, ours has worked perfectly and he uses it all the time."
0,"As many other people have done, I purchased the watch because of previous reputation. The company has done a full 180 from the past. Lots of flash, bling, self generated reviews, empty promises and a poor quality workmanship. First and foremost, keep it away from water. During a race, we went under a sprinkler system and the watch got a little wet. When we passed the finish line, 1/2 hour later, it fell apart. It was full of water inside, the band and buttons fell off. One person said to me when I was picking up the parts from the street ""Oh, it must be a Timex, right?"" What junk. As far as the warrantee it is only valid if you kept it in the original box, never used it and kept 100' from water. I'm going back to Casio. No bling, pomp and circustance, just reliability."
0,Bought this just over a year ago and the strap is falling apart :o( I wear my watches daily and do a lot of physical activity so I need them to be able to take a lot of abuse.....this one did not perform well at all. The color fades to a yucky tarnished brown color....pretty for a few months and then....well yuck! Since you can't change out the strap this thing is a terrible waste of money.....now I have to buy a new watch and it won't be one with this type of strap. The strap has a wider end to it and it keeps catching on everything! Oh and did I mention that the strap has stretched and stretched.....I was using it on hole #3 and now it's on #5 and still stretching......just NOT a good buy.
0,"Should have read the reviews. But since my husband was happy with his Timex Ironman, I thought I'd try one too. After only 6 months of use ( and only on weekends), the watch part popped out of the strap support, and just doesn't stay in place when you try to hook it back in. The watch may keep on ticking, but the strap is useless, effectively making the whole watch useless."
0,"This product was a huge disappointment to me. These trimmers were supposed to last much longer than regular line, but they didn't for me. They were easy to install, but their life was no better than a comparable diameter line I have used for years."
0,"This book started off excellent. The 1st story was very interesting and at the end I wanted to know what happen to Antone and Rita. It would have been nice to know if Rita and her family made it out. I was left hanging. The 2nd story started off slow but progressed nicely and wrapped up at the end. The 3rd story was good but as disrespectful as Desiree was, her mother was nice to tolerate her. I think the story wrapped up nicely.I also think Mia made decisions that were best for her and couldn't continue living her life for grown or almost grown children. The 4th story was flat out boring from the beginning to end. I have dealt with the caring of an elderly grandmother and watched almost the same scenario play out. The story was dragged out tooooo long."
0,"This poacher has worked well for the past two months we've had it. However, the eggs always stick to the poaching cups even with the use of oil and the cups are difficult to clean. Also, the pan started to chip and rust after the third use. We wash it by hand and use a mild soap but the chipping keeps getting worse. I can't recommend this product because the quality of the pan is poor."
0,"This lunch box was great at keeping hot things hot in the top and cool things cool in the bottom, however it didn't last an entire school year. The lining began to separate at the seams on the inside, which made it impossible to clean. Not worth the money for such a short life."
0,I purchased one of the VXA-3000's and the screen would not work right out of the box. I sent the unit to the Service Center in LA that was in the manual and on the webpage. The first time they sent it back to me because the sales receipt wasn't the one they wanted. I sent it back the second time on 23 April and have a sign receipt that they got it. I have called 10 times and either get the answering service or an answering machine that is full. I have email their Customer Service email address and the email comes back as a no longer active email address. Don't know what to do short of going to small claims court.
0,"To say this was a farce is putting it mildly. I ordered the DVD for this movie and Amazon sent me the book, then had the nerve to say I ordered the book, which is a great big lie !!!! Then to return it they make a person print off the return label which is postage paid, then they take it off your credit card refund. They charge you a bundle for it. It only cost under $2.00 which they charged then $3 something for their label. I could have returned it for a lot less on my own. All they do is make money off people like us. They really need to fix their website that if we order a DVD that is what we get. What a joke !!!!!"
0,"To call this DVD a 'workout' is a misnomer. It is more of an instructional video for learning a fairly short exotic-style dance routine. If you are new to exercising you might find it a little toning, but if you are already fit or regularly work out, you won't even break a sweat, just add a few sensual moves to your repetoire. Quite often the instructor has you turnng around and moving away from the TV; it's awfully hard to visually learn something when you have your back to it. There were some fun elements in doing this routine, but a workout it is not."
0,"If I'd wanted a case of the doldrums, I'd have continued watching The Discovery Channel...Cookman's latest tragedy only intensifies the questions behind readers' minds...the search for ""the answer"" is exacerbated by the trials & tribulations of the individual characters...this approach tends to ""muddy"" what Cookman wants us to see as the crystal clear waters of his vision..."
0,"Reading this book is like eating a bowl of Grapenuts w/o milk. It's like dropping ones clothes off at the cleaners only to hear the clerk say ""Sorry, we have no chemicals with which to clean your garments."" This farce is Cookman's second endeavor & sorry to say, it is worse than his first attempt at ""MegaAuthorDom."" His ""historical prose"" only lends to the lack of page-turning ""joie de vivre"" most readers experience when settling down with a ""supposed good read."" Mr. Cookman should revisit his New York roots before attempting such a wayward endeavor, regardless of Mark Rodgers' ministrations on the lack of welfare aid in the State of Ohio."

0,"This is just a warning to anyone who plans to purchase this without listening to it - don't. In all seriousness I have never written a review for anything but I feel so strongly about this that I must do my part. Don't walk, run away from this poor interpretation of what is probably a bad idea in the first place. If by chance one of the artists reads this I would like an explanation or an apology or something. What were you thinking when you produced this thing.

0,"I was really looking forward to Area 51, but I was rudely dissapointed by it's bland mediocre singleplayer campiagn with absolutely no replayability.

0,"Design matters to me. BoxWave overlooked something so basic with this product, it makes me want to smack myself in the head: When you remove the cap from the pen, you cannot put it on the other end of the device. The capacitive stylus is just barely too wide to accomodate the pen cap.(How could this have gone unnoticed? If it was noticed and BoxWave thought it wouldn't matter, that's even worse.)I am certain that this pen cap will either get lost, or (more likely) I'll simply never use the pen side. (It doesn't write particularly well in the first place.)My advice, skip this more expensive version and go with a single-purpose stylus.In fairness, the stylus end of the product does work as advertised."
0,"This is a very cheap sylus. Do not buy! It broke within a week and I can no longer use. The screw in top is stripped and will not stay connected and attached.

0,"Godspell is a 5 star musical, don't get me wrong - I was, however, under the impression that this book would have renditions of the new revival musical (as the preview cites ""new transcriptions approved by Stephen Schwartz...). Instead, it is the very same Godspell p/v/g music originally put out in 1971, with the exception of ""Beautiful City"" (which I found on musicnotes.com three months ago). I'm so bummed I can hardly stand it - just spent money on music I already had."

0,"I bought this for my 4 year old daughter. It is the biggest piece of junk Barbie has ever made, in my opinion. That's scary, since many Barbie items fall apart. Your child will end up pushing the carriage around without the horses, because there is no way to keep them attached. I have tried many things already, and my last option is going to be to wrap packing tape around the horses in an attempt to get them to stay on the carriage. Everything about this $30 set is cheaply made. What a shame!"
0,"I agree with every review so far. This thing will not stay together. My daughter, 4, loves horses and barbie. She is so frustrated with the toy. Do not waste your time. We are going to exchange this right now."
0,"Sorry Barbie fans. This is a disappiontment. The horses just do not stay attached to the carriage at all. The horses are smaller than the standard Barbie horses so they can't share saddles and tack with the other horses in our Barbie collection. Decorative pieces of the carriage fall of regularly. It looks so pretty in the box, but it does no good if the girls can't play with it. As my daughter told me, ""Sell this in the Yard Sale. I never play with it."" I say get the blue Barbie convertable instead."

It actually scared the crap out of me b/c the receiver all of a sudden just gave out a loud constant static, which happens if the monitor is off. I knew that the monitor turned off, but I wasn't expecting it to stop working. IT JUST STOPPED WORKING after the 3rd use. I still have hope and gonna exchange it tomorrow. Maybe it's just this one that's defective. I haven't had any interference problem w/ it the 3 times I was using it."
0,"The reception on this monitor isn't great, and I'm only using it in a small apartment where the baby is literally one room away and there are no closed doors between us. I didn't mind this too much since it basically suited my needs, but then this week the A/C adapter on the receiver broke. We've only been using it for about two months, and it went from one day working fine to one day needing to wiggle the plug to get it right to now the plug doesn't work at all. I can still run that part on batteries, but for how much I'll now spend on those I wish I'd have just spent more for a better monitor."
0,"I returned this item after trying it for one night - all I could hear was STATIC!! It was just awful!! I too trusted the manufacturer - had another FP monitor prior that I loved, but the model was discontinued. This one is just NOT worth it!"
0,"cheese is good and so is this lovely,lovely book"
0,"If you like to hear lots of static, rather than monitor your child, this is the monitor for you.Yes, there are periods where the monitor is usable and there is no static, but you never know when it will go into static mode, which I would estimate it does around 20% of the time.Also, after a few weeks of use, adjusting the volume control would send the receivers into fits of uncontrollable static. This is a permanent re-occuring problem.Under no circumstances should you purchase this monitor if you want a reliable piece of equipment."
0,"We purchased this product when our first option was out of stock, big mistake. We've had Graco monitors for the last 2 years which were always clear but finally died on us. We gave these a try and were very dissapointed. One thing that bothered us was that we run a fan in our son's room for white noise and over the monitor this sounded like really bad static, this never happened on our old monitors. Without the fan on, it wasn't as bad but still not as good as our old ones. I am returning these and waiting for my Graco ones to come in."
0,"We bought this as a replacement when our Graco monitor died. (Well - one of the receivers wouldn't receive anymore, and we wanted/needed two receivers.) After the first few nights, I actually went out and bought another new Graco monitor. This monitor had so much static that we could barely hear our child over it! Also - the lights were so bright (even turned away from the bed) that it was impossible to keep on the nightstand, where I usually like the receiver. I was not impressed and will not purchase another Fisher-Price monitor."
0,"I was very pleased with my old Sounds 'n Lights monitor with one receiver, and was excited to receive this one for a gift. It was going to be much more useful with the dual receivers. There was way too much interference and always a buzzing noise. I couldn't even hear my son crying over the buzzing noise. I tried switching channels and turing the volume up and down, but it didn't help. I will be taking this monitor back today to get a different brand."
0,"I received this monitor as a baby shower gift from my mother-in-law so I was unable to return it. This monitor has been a hassle from the very start. When plugged in, all we get is static. The static isn't as bad when using its battery supply, but it was still hard to hear our daughter unless she was very loud. We have finally gotten tired of this monitor and are switching to a Sony.If you want to sleep I would suggest getting a different monitor."
0,"I returned this product after trying it for a week due to the difficult on/off dial on the receivers. The dial barely sticks up off of the device enough to get a grip on it, and there isn't even an edge that you could use your fingernail to turn it with. I knew that if I couldn't turn it on easily, my husband definitely couldn't with his larger fingers. The last thing I need is for him to have an excuse not to watch the baby."
0,"We plugged this monitor in, and all we could hear was static. Our daughter had to be screaming her head off before we could pick it up on the monitor - and one of the channels didn't work at all! Plus, you have to have the volume up really loud to hear anything, and then the static was too annoying. We took it back and got the Sony Baby Call monitor, and LOVE it - totally worth the extra $20. This monitor was worthless to us."
0,This monitor started off fine but within 6 months was static all the time- it actually kept my husband up at night. I threw them away and bought Sony monitors. So far they are great! Don't get these!!
0,I was given this monitor as a baby shower gift and was very disappointed with the quality. I live in a basement apartment and have three large fish tanks and lots of entertainment equipment. I received a lot of static and could barely hear anything. I even tried them at my moms house and still couldn't get them to work. I used both of the channels and tried everything on the troubleshooter's guide. The monitors that worked for me were the GRACO Ultra Clear Monitors. They are crystal clear no matter where you go with them. They costed 39.99 but they are worth every penny.
0,"We registered for these monitors, and then I noticed that a lot of the reviews claimed that they produced a lot of static, but I thought I would try them anyway.After we got them as a gift, we tried them out and found that they were indeed very staticy. We returned them to babies r'us and bought the sony monitor instead. Even though the sony came with only one monitor and was more expensive, it has a lot more channels and is a much better product. Well worth the couple of extra bucks.I would not recommend buying these!"
0,"This case has the rather critical drawback that our camera (EX-Z110) does not fit in it. The case is too small length-wise and the cover cannot be snapped shut. It is a nice looking leather case, but useless if you have this model (it may work fine for some of the other Exilim models)."
0,"The player itself is ok but the customer service and support at Samsung is the worst I have ever been through. After 5 phone calls, 10 disconnects, and over 10 hours on hold, they have promised for the fifth time they would get back to me. The player is supposed to come with 1 month of free downloads from your choice of three services. None of them will give you more than one week of free connect time and will still charge for each download. Samsung cannot seem to fix the problem and has an I do not care attitude. Avoid them and their products if possible."
0,"Based on Robert Heinlen's book, this is an insult to the man who is considered the greatest science fiction author of all time. The characters are unbelievable and the tactics are idiotic. How could these guys actually expect to win a war, anyway? Bottom line, this is the worst filmation of a book I've ever seen, beating even The Lost World Jurrasic Park."
0,"The book resonates with the ideals of loyalty, self-sacrifice and bravery, not to mention a system of enfrancising voters that this country could use today. The Movie is a disappointing collection of disjointed gratuitous violence, sex and insipid dialogue."
0,"this movie would've had about three more stars if the girl hadn't have gotten killed! I mean, it's bad enough that there's enough violence in this movie to make Braveheart look like 'Barney', but why did the guy have to end up being lonely. And another thing, the girl died a HORRIBLE death! She had things sticking all in her and there was blood coming out of her mouth. And she was ugly and pale in her casket. The rest of the movie was stupid and unrealistic, so she could've gone down beautiful. She was a very beautiful girl. I know that it's just a movie and I shouldn't be getting all worked up about this, but it's the principle of thing, guys! Come on!"
0,"Just when you thought that ShowGirls was the lowest the industry could ever sink, Verhoeven pulls something even worse out of his.....pocket. I am fed up with directors who believe they can ignore everything that makes a movie worth watching so long as they feed us mindless special effects, skin, and gore. Every no-talent actor in this movie needs to go back to the 90210 set they walked off of. And who is the idiot who cast Doogie Howser as a secret intelligence agent. The only thing entertaining about this piece of garbage was that the plot, characters and setting were so stupid it was all FUNNY. I would pay real money to see this thing spoofed on Mystery Science Theater 3000."
0,The film is a total misfire. The attempts at satire are delivered with the subtlety of a atomic bomb. The acting is insipid. The screenplay a total wreck. The direction is a crock. The only reason to watch the film is for the effects work. The rest is trash.
0,"Starship Troopers had a old idea, make a movie about big bugs and guys with big guns killing them. Hey, that would be worth it. What you don't know is that you have to sit through a sappy love story that seems written by a day dreaming fifth grader. This takes up half the time, played out by professional models rather than actors. The future looks like ""Teen"" magazine. As such the lines are said for the simple sake of having them said. The characters have no real depth beyond yelling things and shooting things. Once the action picks up there isn't anything to cry about, lots of big bugs getting ripped apart with major firepower. Stimulating as little of the viewer's brain as possible. But to get there you should skip the first half of the movie.Now if you want a real sci-fi flick with marines and bugs go get Aliens and stop throwing away your money."
0,"This movie fails entirely to live up to Robert Heinlein's novel, and in fact resembles it in name only. Anyone considering this video on the merit of its supposed origin should forget about it. Heinlein is probably spinning in his grave fast enough to generate electricity."
0,"Adrian Paul is not in this movie. Why is it in a list requesting videos staring him? I've found at least 3 movies so far that he's not in & they're in the list of his movies. Somebody needs to do a little correcting, don't ya think!"
0,Single handedly one of the worst movies I have ever seen! Don't waste your money!
0,"The nazification of Carl,the human ""swarms"",and the 90210 theme of the story turned a book about service and duty into an antimilitary film. John Milius would have done justice to the Heinlein story."
0,"There are two basic schools of thought on Starship Troopers (the film): those who saw it for the special effects (5 stars) and those who came for the story (-5 stars). In a nutshell, these are the most oft-recurring scenes (in that order): man getting shot in the head; people making love; people getting eaten by giant insects; people destroyed by interstellar asteroids; people getting shot by insect excrement out of orbit(those bugs have awfully good aim); more dead people; people whose brains are sucked out by a ""Brain Bug"" (actually referred to as such in the film). The book focused on the flaws of a perfect Nazi-type society and by the end the reader almost begins hating the humans and appreciating the bugs. The film was about gore."
0,"Amateurish acting, sophmoric moralizing (yeah, using the exaggerated stereotypes and gung ho kill 'em all attitudes is real revolutionary), and less than polished directing makes this an Oscar winner. Hogans Heroes had a more convincing antiwar/antifacist statement than this crap does."
0,If the screenplay was actually an adaptation of Heinlein's book (which won the Hugo award) then this movie might have been quite a bit better.The movie ended up being nothing more than a mixture of some deleted soap opera scenes interlaced with a script. Try reading the book and you will see how the story improves when all of these scenes are removed.
0,"An insult to one of the better science fiction books written by Robert Heinline. This film totally misses the point of the book (which was a study on both the nature of politics and on the future of warfare). Instead we get some really cute young boys and girls and some really disgusting deaths and maimings and some (it must be admitted) spiffy special effects of space armadas and alien insects.The plot of this film makes just about no sense. Character motivations are trivial and dull.Worst of all: there are no starship troops in powererd armor! Why didn't they call this film ""Starship Lookers (get eaten by bugs)""?The director (Verhoven) hasn't had a good idea in 10 years. Why Hollywood film companies still let him spend millions of dollars to produce junk like this, well, that's Hollywood for you."
0,"This is an in-your-face, hackey-slashey, gory, action adventure movie. Or at least it tried to be. ""Starship Troopers"" was needlessly gory, not that I didn't like it, but it just got graphic to the point where it was stupid. But I like bloody movies, so it's all good. Should've gotten an Oscar for best make-up."
0,"These picks are probably great, but due to the packaging they come loose and then fall out the cracks in the box.If you buy these, unless it is packed in with many other items, it is unlikely these will ever reach you."
0,"These are good picks, I had some from earlier and I really enjoyed using them. So I thought I would go ahead and buy this 12pk. I read a bunch of reviews that said there was some missing from the package but I took my chances anyway. I regret doing so. This item was shipped with other items in a larger box with just enough of a gap for almost all of the picks to slip through. There was three left when it arrived. 3 out of 12. With so many reviews that warn about this shipping problem I am amazed that this hasn't been taken care of. Not happy with this at all. I strongly recommend purchasing this great product somewhere else until somebody fixes this problem."
0,What I absolutely hate about this album is how they destroyed Angel Eyes with the Disco beat. Angel Eyes is one of the greatest Roxy Music songs. I got this album because I could not find Country Life. Imagine my surprise when Angel Eyes came on with its chinka choo beat. I threw the disc away.....Roxy Music albums should be enjoyed from begining to end. Country Life is a great album to start with if you want to rock out. Manifesto is an interesting album. Roxy Music is like a painting. Check into anything from Avalon and before and it would be better than this album..
0,I was kink of curious what kind of movies were being released in the 70's--horror movie films. Both of these movies were pretty bad--I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.
0,"I purchased the Eddie Bauer stroller and highchair and I was very impressed, but I was rather dissapointed with this bouncer, it is very cheaply made, very hard on babies back, does not sustain very much weight. The toys above the hood are horrible, they got in my sons face a lot. Very hard to move from place to place. I gave it a one because I liked that the little head rest was very soft material."
0,"We registered for the Baby Papasan and were given this instead ""because it's better."" I'm so disappointed with it! Baby is only 8 weeks old (12 lbs., 22""), and she's already nearly too long and heavy for it. She only has a couple of inches to go before her feet are at the edge of the ""lip."" Also, because there's no support at the head end of the bouncer, when I put her in it, that end falls down a few inches. We also have the Fisher Price Learning Patterns Infant-to-Toddler rocker, which both I and she infinitely prefer. This bouncer is all washed-out beige, which a baby can't even see this early. The rocker is much more sturdy and has much brighter contrasting patterns. She coos and loves playing in the rocker. It's $20 cheaper and much better. Check out that bouncer before purchasing this one."
0,"I registered for this bouncer because it has the screen that zips all around it. I thought the product would be a good way to entertain my son and protect him from being bothered by my cats. Well, the screen worked to enclose my son in the bouncer and the cats didn't bother him, but my son hated to be in the bouncer for more than 2 minutes. This bouncer is dull and boring. The color is neutral and matches the Eddie Bauer bassinet, but the color does not seem to be appealing to a baby. The nature sounds are nice, but the mobiles that are attached to the top of the bouncer are not very attractive---my son pretty much ignored them. The vibration of the bouncer wasn't enough to soothe my baby---he would cried after being in the bouncer for just a couple of minutes. My son preferred the motion of a swing to the vibration of the bouncer. For my next child, I plan to get a bouncer that is more colorful and inviting."
0,"We picked this item out for our registry after looking at it in the store. It seemed great! Our son hates it. The assembly was fairly easy. We were very disappointed with the sounds it came with. It was full of static and we thought it was broken until I read someone else's review that had the same problem. The entire bouncer is awkward to handle whether you are folding it up, storing it, or carrying it somewhere. Perhaps I am not used to these new models of bouncers but I was certainly not impressed with this one."
0,"I registered for this for my son because it was very neutral and not as ugly as most of the chairs out there. He was not a fan from the very beginning. The chair doesn't really bounce; there is nothing for his feet to do; the colors aren't exciting; the toys aren't fun.We bought the Fisher-Price Aquarium bouncer and he LOVES that chair! There were instant smiles and laughter and he can kick and grab for the dangling toys. He loves to watch the bubbles and the fishies, too.Now our ""soothing and neutral"" chair is in the closet. Maybe we'll use it in the summer outside when we need it zip out the flies..."
0,"I was so excited about this seat. I am a new Mom. I have 3 dogs, so my thought was the screen would be great to keep the dogs from getting to close to the baby. Well...the screen is the least of the problems with this seat.The seat was fine when my daughter was a new born and used both sets of head rests (no head rests included with this seat) and she didn't move much.The problems:The seat is too wide, my baby falls from side to side.The seat belt is too small, and too low. My daughter is 13 pounds and the straps are at the end and hardly fit her.My daughter is 24""long and with the seat belt on she can't straighten her legs.The toys are too close to her face.The music is aweful, sounds like it is broken, lots of static, but this is the second one I got and they both sounded the same.I could go on but you get the idea.I have found that simple is best with a bouncy seat, even for a cranky baby!!"
0,"I began this book knowing nothing about Persia aside from the brief mention everyone gets in Western Civ. I now know next to nothing. In all fairness, it is not the author's fault entirely. The book is well-written, but spans so great a period of time - rather important cultural beginnings and whatnot - that no one incident, subject or aspect of Persian culture and society is truly adequately treated. I would suggest this as the start for someone who thinks he might have an interest to pinpoint areas for further study. But, check it out of the library."
0,solid construction poor design of a few items buttons difficult to get the right one without taking the headset off to find the buttons and the charger connector is small and inadequate falls out easily and headset stopped taking a charge after a few uses had to send it back sound quality was excellent and the headset reception was good. Could not recommend for the charger design itself would be nice if this charged via usb
0,"The headset works as advertised. I've paired it with my MacBook Pro as both a headset and headphones. When listening to iTunes music, however, there's a persistent hiss in the background. Additionally, the controls are in an awkward location and require you to push too hard to activate the buttons. I shouldn't have to crush my ear to play/pause the music.It's also annoying that the power adapter isn't a more standard plug type. A mini-USB plug would be great since that would allow the headphones to be charged by plugging them into a USB port. That's handy when you're overseas and have a limited set of international power adaptors."
0,This CD is a disapointment. There is a reason there are no samples for this disc. Buyer Beware.
0,"There were no metaphors in this book, nor was it parallelled in any way to real life. I was not impressed at all. People would be much better off reading things like Dostoevsky or Hemingway. Little children, read Jack Kerouac's On The Road if you like Pokemon!"
0,The book was ok but it wasn't my favorite. I think they left out too many episodes and they didn't put enough parts in each episode they talked about. So Ididn't like it that much.
0,"I have detailed automobiles for over 20 years and prefer Meguiar's products. This is an OK product but one I would never buy again. The consistency was too thick resulting in more product being used, and takes at least four times longer to apply. You have to apply in smaller areas over and over again to work the product into each crevice between letters, numbers, ridges, etc. similar to polishing metal. Just too tedious. This would be fine if the tires looked better but I find they look that same as the other higher-end tire shine products. The grape smell was very nice but that's about it. I'll stick with Meguiar's Hot Shine for overall ease of application, speed and quality of shine."
0,"first off, the song nutshell, is not an adema song. It's an alice in chains song! anybody that thinks that it's an adema song is retarded! And yes they did really did screw it up, it sounds horrible. The the AIC masterpiece is 100x times better. End of story"
0,"I waited a long time to read this book, and I was truly disappointed. It took me two hours to read and the characters had no meaning to me. Great subject matter, totally unfocused writing."
0,"This book was really, really missing something. It lacked romance. I couldn't get past the first chapter. The first person viewpoint left me confused. It lacked true heart tugging passion. I saw every sterotype known to man in the firt chapter. I've read MUCH!!! better."
0,I thought this book was one of the most boring books I ever read. I usually love to read but this one was horrid.
0,"Definitely try this shoe on first at a store to find your size, it runs extremely large, and thus your foot's placement is off which leads to it being very uncomfortable."
0,"Pro's:- quick set up- comfortable- average sound quality- hands freeCon's- will never reach 2 feet away from phone without making conversation impossible, due to hiss- charger connects poorly to headset, charging very difficult- the same button is used for power (on/off press) and volume control (up / down), making it easy to end conversation instead of adjusting volume- ear fit is cumbersome"
0,"THE MUSEUM OF HOAXES is a book based on a website collecting a variety of tall tales, con games, fantastic stories and urban legends. The problem with the book is that the haphazard way the stories are put together and their general brevity works on a website, but are far from acceptable in a book. Very little investigation is done into the actual circumstances of each hoax and the prose lacks any variation or even a good sense of humor. The best thing about this book is that it might pique a reader's interest to investigate some of the stories behind these little glimpses into mankind's collective gullibility. Other than that, I can't find any reason to recommend this ""web book."""
0,"HiI got this book in 2009 as it was required by a course I took. Unfortionatly, I bought later other fundamental books because this one assumes you have strong background specially in Chemical Engineering. If you have background other than Chemical Eng, this book is not designed for you. You'll spend a lot of hours trying to figure out how examples have been solved. You'll know that after you get some leveling from other basic books.For Chemical Engineers, this book is their holy one."
0,When they get cold (these are ski goggles after all) the plastic snaps that allow the strap to be adjusted get brittle and snap. This happened on my FIRST use at 10F temperature. The cheap plastic snaps broke. I guess I could repair/restitch new (metal) ones in - but why? As long as you don't adjust the straps they should be OK I suppose?
0,"I know this is a popular tool and has garnered good reviews in comparison tests. I liked it when I first started using it but after about 500 cuts I noticed the plunger wasn't working as smoothly as before, and I keep my tools clean & oiled. The sliding mechanism was wearing out far too rapidly than a 'professional' tool should. Then one day at work it just went dead; hadn't been dropped, wasn't overheated. So I probably got about 1000 cuts on this machine. The replacement? A Lamello, what I should have gone for originally."
0,"I've had this plate jointer for a couple of months now, and I use it fairly often, but certainly not everyday but when I need it to work I need it to work. I have found one major weakness of this model when compaired to other brands: The pivots for the fence are plastic. Today during use the pivots bound up, and the little plastic pivots shredded, the upshot was game over until I can find replacement parts. Not what I'd expect of a ""professional"" grade tool that I rely on to keep on working so that I can keep earning the $$$, especially since I spent more to get this one. Shame on porter cable for such a weak design. Either spend less for the dewalt or more for a lamello, I wish I had."
0,"I recommend this faucet to anyone who likes the way it looks,as I do, and does not need to use it. As long as you do not turn on the water, it does not leak. If you need to use this as a faucet, I do not recommend it. I leaks horribly and when I tried to get Kohler to make good on the warranty it would only send weird looking parts with no instructions. The plumber said it would cost three times the price of a new faucet to try to fix it and he said he did not think it would really stop leaking. I finally bought another faucet--but not a Kohler!!"
0,"Pretty much in agreement with everyone else here. It's been in for less than a year, and just started leaking from the base. What a waste of money."

0,"Seriously, just spend a little extra, do some research, and get a better vacuum. Mine clogged up, so I bought another, and the 2nd one clogged up too - and I don't have pet hair problems or overly used or dirty carpets. If you could clear the clog on your own, I wouldn't be complaining. After all, I know how to use a screwdriver. But the problem is, the places where it gets clogged, you can't access without destroying the hose. I change the bag regularly, so its not like its operator error or something. It gets clogged to the point that no dust, debris, or anything will ever reach the bag. This vacuum, for all intents and purposes, is disposable. Might be good for a dorm room where you can just throw it out after the semester is over because you don't want to move it. But if you're a real person who wants a vacuum to last for more than 4-5 uses, run away from this vacuum. Thanks!"
0,"If you liked the book, you'll hate the movie. Totally miscast, we needed a large, scary Helga!Who wrote the screen play? They changed everything I liked about the book. I hate it when a really good story gets butchered!"
0,Not a great movie...but okay. The actors are not very interesting...the acting is so-so. I would not recommend this movie for those who seek a lot of action. It's more like a Disney type film.
0,"I have followed all instructions, I have cleaned the filters regularly and this piece of doggy doo won't pick up the smallest of mess on the floor. I realize I only paid $50.00 for this piece of junk, but you would think that companies would take some pride in the quality of the products they put their name on. I guess if you don't have the budget to spend $500 on a vacuum then you are just out of luck."
0,"As a fluent speaker of Italian, I can tell you that Rick Steves' understanding of the language is crude at best. He makes terrible mistakes and will only cause you to look as ignorant as he does if you use his book. There are literally HUNDREDS of better ways to learn the language."
0,"This book was difficult to use when trying to translate an Italian word. There is no single lookup, but rather chapters on various topics. I waded through these chapters when looking for a word, but was never able to find any of the words I was looking for. These were frequently seen words also. For example, you would think the chapter on driving would include frequently seen road signs, but it doesn't."

Amazon did not use this information to update his address within his Wish List. When I ordered $138 worth of magazines from his wish list last December, Amazon hid the street address ""for privacy"" - therefore I could not know the magazines would be sent to the wrong address.In November, I asked my son if he'd like to have these magazines renewed and he said he had never received any!After I spoke with Amazon, my son now gets a message when he goes to his Wish List that his address doesn't match the one in his account, so it's clear Amazon is now aware of this problem.The publisher will not redo this subscription for Luerzers, saying the magazines were never returned to them, and Amazon has not responded to my request for a refund."
0,"I bought this based on other reviews saying what a great family film this is. Hah! The language is foul. The early scenes have teens having beer parties ect. The rotten language is all through this film. The animals are so obviously phony that you'll laugh yourself silly. The acting is awful. The plot is boring. If you're looking for a beautiful outdoor wilderness film,I advise that you keep on looking...elsewhere.A Concerned Christian Mom"

0,"Absolute Junk product, do not buy. Works when it wants to, needs to be in an area that receives ALOT of direct sunlight, LEDs are not that attention calling in the first place. Do Not Buy."
0,"The charm itself was acceptable, however, due to the lack of care involved when packaging this item, the chain arrived to me knots and broken beyond repair. The chain arrives coiled up in a little pouch. For such a fragile chain, this is definitely a necklace that needs to be secured in a box, not coiled up in a small pouch where it will likely get in knots. The chain was broken and useless, i had to return it, and just purchase a new chain locally, as this was suppose to be a Christmas gift."
0,"Although titled ""large"" print bible, this is anything but. Even the publisher's specifications say it is ""regular"" print. When I called the publisher, they said that the print was 11 pt, and they didn't know the font.Now, to me, 11 pt type is definitely not large. I wouldn't even use that size to write a letter. It is small, cramped, and difficult to read. So if you are looking for a ""large"" print bible, definitely DON'T get this one."

0,"To this very day I still cannot understand why everyone loves Tomb Raider so much. Aside from the odd improvement here and there, the games haven't changed vastly (I think Doom to Quake is vastly) at all. I find controlling Lara very clumsey, the 3rd person view not help. Plus, Lara does all the aiming so the satisfaction of blasting something's head off from a distance is non-existent. I found myself fart around half the time. Where's the fun in climbing up a rock face? I'm all for puzzles but I find these games boring and labourious. Oh, and Lara Croft is not fit because she's not real and if she was she'd fall forwards due to her massive mammaries. So stop ogling at your screen, you sad people!"
0,"i really like the look of this clock and it worked quite well for almost a year, but...it seems to have lost its little mind. i can't count on the time being correct and when it's wrong it's WAY wrong as in many hours.and then just to be playful i guess, it decides to correct itself. so sometimes it's right and some times it's not, and some times the second hand works, but mostly it doesn't.based on my present experience, i would not purchase from this clock company again."
0,"This is the worst thing I've ever bought. It's an atomic clock, but if the reception is not good enough to get the long-wave radio, you should be able to adjust it manually. But this unit doesn't allow you to do that properly: when you press the manual button, it will not stop when you release it. I bought the first one, it doesn't catch the radio, RMAed and got a replacement still NO. while my old oregon scientific one get good signal reception. The quality is extremely poor, it's a joke that it has a ""QC"" label while the two units I receive are both DOA: the notch are broken so it can not hold the engine. I can not even tell if the manual adjust button is design flaw or just poor made. Returned for refund after second try and still not getting my money back after 1 month. waste of my time."
0,"I purchased this clock in February 2006, and it worked great for 1 year. This year the clock began to reset time to the Eastern Time Zone, regardless whether other time zones were selected. I tried different brands of batteries, and still the same problem. Now the clock won't work at all. I downloaded the product manual from the La Crosse website, to see if there was something I was missing. I tried the troubleshooting steps recommended, but without success. I do not recommend this clock."
0,"I agree with the comments that it's a boring film - no matter how important the subject. And any actress could have played the part that Jolie plays. She just looks sad most of the time. Moves slowly, with a sad look. That's about all the acting that was done on her part, I'd say, except for one emotional scene. (Several people write about her beauty. I don't see that, either. But that's my problem, I guess.) Important subject, but a bad film, I think. Rent it before you buy it, I'd say."
0,"This book has about as much to do with abs as a book on stamp collecting. From the bizarre pictures of a guy doing strange contortionist exercises on the edge of a pool and then in the pool to the useless plyometrics exercises to the ""repulse the monkey"" and ""power slide"" exercises, I found this book utterly useless and, quite frankly, a joke. Don't bother."

0,"I've been a huge Boston since the late 70's and still know every song on their debut album by heart. But, this entire album is overproduced, schizophrenic, contrived rubbish. There is little coherency in the song writing, the vocals, and the stumbling, not-at-all-clever political commentary. I agree with another reviewer on the topic of why have anyone but Brad Delp sing? He IS the sound of Boston as much as Tom's buzzing Les Pauls through his Rockman/Marshall rig. So he can't nail all the glass-breaking notes anymore - big deal - his voice is pure mercury. Fran lacks the soulful timbre that makes Brad's voice one of the best in rock history. Though, I am sure Tom Scholtz satisfied some artistic vision with this release, it is an album that will be sighed at by Boston fans and laughed at by others. I'll keep my fingers crossed for the next one sometime next decade."
0,"If you're looking for Boston, they simply aren't here on this CD. It seems as though they lost the ""sound"" they are known for. My recommendation is to pick up the original Boston albums. Even RTZ was so much better. At the very least RTZ captured the sound we all love.Sad to seem them go. Try again guys."
0,"This album is almost completely lifeless. Almost. Every once in awhile you feel just a hint of the old spark that made Boston a watershed band, but never for an entire song, and never for very long within any given song.Take a pass on this, especially if you loved the band that redefined rock in the 70's. They aren't here anymore. This outing is preachy and tired, and just plain sad."
0,"Interesting to note that in the musical world of such a total left-winger like Tommy, all attractive women are addressed as ""mama."" Let's face it folks, this band (or more specifically, Scholz) has been on a linear line downward after, say ""Don't Look Back,"" and ""Korporate Amerika"" is not worth your hard-earned cash. Even a marginal effort like ""Walk On"" would have 2 or 3 tracks of interest. Not this one...time for Tom to hang it up..."
0,"i am a huge boston fan, and since it is only one discevery 20 years, i look forward to boston, not tomscholz and friends.what and who is the woman on the disc, and why isntbrad delp singing all the tunes?very disappointed in the music, not enough of boston'strademark guitar licks, or organs.well, here's hoping when the next disc comes out inapproximately 2011, that it's back to basics!!"
0,"Ha ha, this album is hilarious. Doesn't sound anything like Boston's early, glory days. It's a mixture of really bad songwriting and singing. Some of it sounds like it's band that's a male version of Abba, with them told to really embarass themselves. Then there's the song ""Turn it Off"", which is angrier and heavier, but still sums up how the listener should approach this ""album"".Lame, foolish, syrupy, lite-rock in the poorest way. Sorry folks, this is bottom of the barrel stuff..."
0,"The watch is quite lightweight and comes with good features. However, I think it is very hard to use. You have to hit the buttons just right and for the certain amount of times to change anything. If you lose the directions, you will never remember how to change it. It took me over 6 months to change it. I had many people try to alter it, but it was to no prevail. Additionally, the watch is not very water resistant. I went swimming a couple of times and now I hardly see the time due to the water.I would recommend paying more for a lot better watch. For this was a waste of money!"

0,We got the player and charged it up. There was no problem loading music onto it. However when we tried to listen to the radio station we usually listen to when out for walk we could not get it. Only one station would come in clearly where we normally could get dozens. We also had trouble switching from mp3's to FM and then put it into some mode we could not seem to get out of. Rather than fight with it we sent it back.
0,"I just cannot get this player to work with my PC. It keeps shutting down my video component (why? I don't know) or it freezes my PC up. I can't figure out how to get my PC to recognize the device.

0,"I bought this on the strength of previous reviews, but I am disappointed and will probably return it. No range maps! No real distribution information at all. No sizes! No tracks for mammals. No Swahili names. Teeny tiny print that you need a magnifying glass to read. The information is not really organized at all, but just strung out in one long paragraph, so you need to hunt through to find specifics. The photos are of varying quality...some not very good. Over 2/3 of the book is birds...I plan to bring a separate field guide for birds, so I didn't really need the bird section. Very few insects or reptiles. I suppose if you want an all-in-one book with a little bit of everything, it may be useful, but for my purposes, not so much. Its too bad there wasn't a preview for this one, or I would have know these things up front. I'm going to try this one for mammals, which seems much better organizedPocket Guide to Mammals of East Africa"
0,"We bought this book and National Audubon Society Field Guide to African Wildlife. The Audubon book was much better. I regret purchasing this book - I feel as though it was a waste of money and suitcase space. We only looked at this book to compare it to the Audubon book to see where this book was lacking. This book is slightly smaller than the Audubon book, but not enough to justify purchasing this one instead of the Audubon book."

0,"i have been a KMK for a long time. I was anticipating this album for awhile. Quite disappointed. When i first got #7, i thought it was just ok. But after listening to it for a couple of times, i grew into it and i liked it alot. Im having the same feeling with Koast to Koast, except I really dont think i will grow to like this one. It seems like they just threw a bunch of crap onto an album. Even Joint Venture was better than this, and that was a bunch of old songs remixed with a couple of new ones.Im still a huge KMK fan, but this is quite disappointing."

I'm so glad she warned me because I had bought it to charge my son's Nintendo DS in the car. This is a horrible product and it does NOT work."
0,This item was purchased in 2011 but when we received the item it had expired in 2009. It was right on the box. Bought 3 and they all said the same. This should atleast be stated in description. Be careful when you purchase an item that would have a date and ask.
0,"I love this game. The samurai horror movie milieu is exotic and lots of fun; the character control is fabulous; the story line is interesting; and game play is not monotonous. That said, I've given it a one because the copy protection scheme physically damaged at least two CD drives. A third one may have been damaged; I can't tell because the computer itself is damaged in some way that makes installing the OS impossible. There is no question that the copy protection on this game was responsible. It's a bit like being out on a date with the most beautiful girl in the world and discovering that she's a brain-dead racist. Just tidy up and walk away."
0,"My daughter is 18 months old and she hates this book. I know ""hate"" is a strong word, but she literally closes the book and throws it on the floor every time I open it. We usually read when I sit her down on a potty and my daughter loves this routine. Since I've bought the Going to Sleep book, which was maybe a month ago, she has never allowed me to finish reading it to her.She loves to read. Some of our favorite books are Goodnight, Gorilla, Little Blue Truck, I am a Bunny... I think the reason why she dislikes the Going to Bed book is because it is drawn so unrealistically and with too many lines and details. It is irritating to the eyes. To top that, it is about going to bed which is not a favorite activity on a any toddler's list. Sorry, but this book was just not for us."
0,"I rate this low because of problems with drivers from this company who rarely updates them. This is a niche item from a boutique company that doesn't really make a whole lot of differance in actual performance.My experience is it fails to outperform any other 1 Gig card, and I've had problems with drivers when transitioning from Windows XP to Windows 7. Plus, it throws off a lot of heat that your pc may not be able to handle."

0,"This book was a painful read.Ms Perry's attempt to answer her readers' demand for an in-depth approndissement of character development was less than seamless.It is commendable that her strong sense of plot and logical,if surprising denouements,rivet the reader.However, her development as a mistress of suspense should always be a the forefront of her creations.As a major writer,her intelligence should dominate."

The other problem I have is that the buttons push down close to the back of the tool bench.

0,"Leonard Maltin's publications are usually fantastic. This calendar, however, was a big disappointment.This title offers 366 short one paragraph capsule reviews of Leonard Maltin's favorite films. It is printed in black, white and grey with no photographs. The reviews that I read provide no real insight into the films. It also has a very basic layout which makes the calender even less appealing. (Many calendars which provide black and white text only, present it in a layout that makes it appealing when displayed. This one does not!)"

0,"Matthew Modine is a fantastic actor but lately it seems his fortunes have turned. He's rarely in anything decent and I guess his TV show ""The Bedford Diaries"" has been cancelled after 8 episodes. How low do you have to go to get cancelled from the WB?Anyway, I was excited to find a film with Modine in the starring role that I had not seen.This movie is terrible! I expected nothing and got it three-fold. I don't even know where to begin. The writing is bad and the characters just keep repeating their lines as though they can't believe the garbage they have to say. The plot is totally corny. I think the only reason I kept watching is because I don't recall ever seeing Modine so skeevy before and that was actually interesting.But don't let that sway you.Believe me, if I Could give this film negative stars, I totally would."
0,first off this cd is pointless too realesed. Winning Combinations?!?!?! whats the point the songs on here are in too many little hits cd packages GIVE IT A BREAK. but the bands included on here are okay the scorpions are good but whitesnake is just another 80s hairmetal band look i like this kind of music but whitesnake there only good song is here i go again and the other songs arent that good really. Scorpions though there actullay a pretty good band. Seriously buy an album from both of these bands instead of this CD. A true sell-out cd
0,"This, unfortunately, sounds like it was a great performance--both Flagstad and Melchior at the peak of their vocal gifts, Furtwangler gloriously confirming his place in the small constellation of great Wagner conductors--but for all that, the sound is atrocious: dim, murky, hissy, and suffering in dynamic range. One day, sound reproduction technology might be able to salvage this wonderful historical document, but it's obviously too mighty a challenge for modern day sound engineers."

I didn't enjoy listening to the album as a whole, but if a Cheb Nasro song was played amongst other rai music, it would blend in unnoticed.Stick with Cheb Mami and Rachid Taha, if you like rai."
0,I am a big IG fan however i have been disappointed about this DVD. The only things I have to say is that the sound on this DVD is not Dolby Digital or even properly coded for 5.1 sound in any for. The set list and the show are great however the sound is really a big disappointment. It does not even sound as good as a CD from them.really too bad it could have been great. lets hope the do release a DVD one day that does have good sound along with it.
0,"I'm a huge 'tones fan! I've been skankin' to 'em ever since Adonai made its first hit. But if you loved Strikeback or the other early stuff, you're going to hate this cd. It will be a huge disappointment. If you've paid attention, you've noticed that they have progressively become more melodic, but they always had one or two songs that kept it hard core. There would be songs where they rapped instead of sang. Well it's all singing now... This cd is something that may make you sway side to side, but it definitely isn't the hard hitting 'tones that I love. For now, I'll stick with the old school stuff and keep the hard stuff playing. Maybe ska is just dead..."

DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!! (and i do not say this lightly; have never written a negative review before)."
0,"This movie was quite an inaccurate version of Cleopatra, perhaps it was intentional. The 1 star is for Timothy Dalton and only him! His performance as Julius Caesar is fantastic. Leonor Varela who plays Cleopatra seemed at the beginning of the movie to be lacking tremendously in the acting department. To my great relief she made some progress later in the movie. She is beautiful but needs a lot of work if she is to be respected. Billy Zane was okay as Mark Antony, perhaps if his character's script was of more substance he would have done a much better job! Apart from the fantastic costumes and Timothy Dalton, this movie deserves just a C."
0,"20 minutes into this movie I was disgusted by the terrible acting and the complete disregard for the book on which is it supposedly based. The actress playing Cleopatra protrays her as petulent, spoiled and immature, whereas in the book one saw Cleopatra as highly astute, regal, and concerned first about her country and its people. In the movie she handed Egypt to Ceasar eagerly, whereas in the book she refused to surrender anything to Rome. Likewise, Dalton portrays Ceasar as a complete ****.Perhaps if this were not based on Margaret George's Memiors of Cleopatra, I would be more kind in my review, but it pains me to think of the years of research wasted because of some second-rate film-maker's idea of good story-telling.At 975 pages the book may be too meaty for most, but if you really want to learn about this queen, read the book instead."
0,"As a lover of ancient history, I was excited to watch yet ANOTHER film on the life of Cleopatra. This film is extremely glamourous, and seems as if it follows the script of an ancient soap opera rather than the life of the last queen of ancient Egypt. The filmmakers obviously didn't create this to be a factual account of Cleo's life. The acting by Billy Zane (Antony) and Timothy Dalton (Caesar) was very good, and Lenor Varella (Cleopatra) provides a good show, if you like passion and overdone drama. If you want to see a fictionalized and modern televison view of Cleopatra's life, than this is your movie, but the Cleopatra movie starring Elizabeth Taylor is far superior."
0,How these movies were made amazes me. How they were put in a collection that they think people would buy amazes me even more. This is absolutely the worst collection of DVDs ever. Each movie is a new kind of horrible. Each one is worse than the next. Don't waste your time.
0,"Hi,This movie is bad. Well, actually, as said before the sets and costumes are good, but Leonor Varela, who plays Cleopatra, quite simply CANNOT act...not even if her life depended on it. She might look nice but every time she said something I felt like ""oh...not again""...instead of spending all that money on the sets, they should have gotten a better lead and thought a little more about the script. Billy Zane was good though...which earned it a second star."

0,"I can only echo the dismal opinions of most of the reviewers of this product. It might be the slowest copying software that I have ever seen, barely running at 1.5 times the speed of a movie. With the dismal write speed combined with the pathetic read speed, you need about four hours to copy a three hour movie. It does make a decent frisbee for the dog, or coaster. Avoid like the plague. If you try to talk to customer support, well, you'll wish you hadn't. Written by a person with no real expertise in DVD software."

No history, no accounts of other people, just her cutesy monolog about ""little bitty things that go bump in the twilight"". NOT at all scary or historic. I would have settled for accurate but not even close. I couldn't even overlook how bad it was and just take down what was haunted because there was absolutely nothing there. I put the book in my bathroom where it has the slightest chance of doing some good. It's so embarrassing when one has guests and runs out of toliet paper."
0,"I purchased this football at a sporting goods store. The quality of the leather is decent, though not a great deal better than the some of the nicer composites. Perhaps when I break it in more, the leather will become tackier, but that's not going to happen because the ball is too poorly made to play with. The seams at the nose are slightly misaligned, causing some asymmetry and a wobbly flight pattern. The side panels also bulge a bit right at the seams, no matter how inflated/deflated the ball is. I've tried to work the stiffness out of the leather here, but the bulge persists. To look at, these are very minor defects, but they combine to form a ball that is very difficult to throw a tight spiral with. I really can't use this ball. Too bad."

0,"We bought our Brill mower about two years ago. Our problem is with the battery, which costs $120 to replace. It was supposed to be good for 500 rechargings, but after no more than about 50 rechargings, it no longer holds enough energy to run the mower for more than a minute or two. The place we bought it from has offered no remedy, either a discount on a new one or a way to fix the one we have.

0,"You don't see anything but a few minutes of the opening ceremony (so if you're hoping to see all of Mr. Bean's routine, or the dance numbers, you'll have to go to YouTube) ; you don't see anything but a few minutes of everything!

After he was finish installing them, the pigeons just maneuver their way to the middle of the spikes and sat there. Now I know why you can't purchase these in the hardware stores, customers would be contantly returning them. I wasted my money. The installer boxed the ledges off with wire and no more pigeons."

0,"Didn't work at all for me because the out-of-the appliance I wanted to use with it had to much wattage (a track light) and clapper only works up to 250 watts. Oh well, maybe I can use for my Christmas tree."
0,"After owning it for a few months, the clapper died today. As I clapped I heard characteristic buzzing noise of electronic item being shortcircuited, and to my horror when I looked at the clapper it was flashing bright yellow from the inside, it was actually on fire inside and smoking really bad. I unplugged it immediately. I'm glad I was there because this thing was actually on fire (don't they have a fuse or something to prevent this?), and it could have burned down my house. And for the record, all I used with it was a 100W lamp.It's a fun and convenient little object, but after seeing the fireworks today, I would never ever recommend it to anyone. Moreover, I'd actually recommend you stop using it immediately, unless you think $15 toy is worth risking your whole house, and maybe lives of those who live there. This thing is a disaster waiting to happen. Consider yourself warned."
0,"We used it for a couple weeks as an easy way to turn on hard to reach plug in lamps & a power strip which is behind a couch, which in theory, sounds like the perfect product for those 2 issues. unfortunately, it is difficult to get the correct cadence down to consistently make the clapper work.Also, when watching movies or games, the louder sound effects, especially gun fire, cause the clapper to turn on & off = very frustrating"
0,This thing will probably work if you are in a perfectly quiet room and are capable of perfect clapping.It takes me on average 5 claps to get it to recognize a clap and then it turns off itself when listening to the radio.Its a great concept but mind numbing that it is simply such a bad product
0,"We had purchased this for our Grandfather who had just come home from the hospital. We thought this would make his life alittle easier. It didn't. You have to clap just right for it to work. Needless to say, we were disappointed and returned it."
0,"The books premise is pretty standard, everyone is leaving poor hippopotamus out of their activities. In the end, they invite her to join them, and SHE CAN'T DECIDE if she wants to stay or go! In my opinion hippopotamus shouldn't even be considering a life of solitude as she is meant to be relatable to small children, and I certainly don't want my little one to consider solitude over joining in the games of other children. The WORST part however, is that, even after inviting hippopotamus to join them, the other animals STILL LEAVE OUT ARMADILLO!The illustrations are okay, not more than that. However, even the best illustrations could not save this book from the nightmarish ending. This book is meant to be for small children, and in my opinion all books for small children should have a happy ending.I do not understand the popularity of this author, my son was given four of her books for his birthday, and I have a feeling they will all soon be in the trash can."

0,"Her voice is, of course, beautiful. The arrangements, however, were blah, bland, and boring.

0,"Cutting a drunken path, Bukowski shows people how to say ""no"" to the would-be puppet masters that would make them dance.There are, of course, other great writers who have carved their own place in literature but this biography gets so tangled in gossipy shallow stories and drunk escapades that I honestly think Howard Sounes has missed the point. I think he shoots only ankle-high on his subject. Obviously a great amount of research went into this book. Sounes can turn up facts the way some can turn up lawn trimmings. With the magnificent material he had to work with I was disappointed in his fixation with the sensational. Who cares if Bukowski drunkenly plowed it into some guy's rump mistakenly thinking the guy was a woman? I guess this sells books. If you really want to know the life, great humor, and importance of Charles Bukowski my advice is to go directly to the source. In years to come there will certainly be a much better biography than this effort."
0,"I read Carroll's book and thought it was very informative.

0,"This DVD was recomended to me by a friend of a friend, I guess I should have investigated it more before purchasing. I would like to have known that it has very little to do with Constantine and nearly all to do with the Holocaust.With history used as a model for the story as opposed to seeking accuracy, it is close enough for laypeople to see it as accurate. The story comes across to me more as the journey of a single man going from extreme naivite to understanding that there are bad things in the world...and looking to lay the blame somewhere. If someone is looking for a reason to put down the church this is one to buy, if your looking for history of the church to make an informed decision I would suggest looking elsewhere."

The tiny, blurry ""manual"" which is a single page folded in half doesn't describe how to open the case, so I can't even test it, not that I want to. The product page says it supports SATA II and over 500GB drives while the box says 500GB max and makes no mention of SATA II.Flimsily made, packaging not worthy of CompUSA-branded products, and of course my personal inability to open the case, makes this one a big-time loser."

There were two main problems I have with it. 1st- when my toddler nods off, I can tell she is uncomfortable as her head is flopped forward. 2nd- I have to constantly readjust the seat belt, every time I put her in, because the seat belt slots do not have any type of hold on the seat belt itself. My parents bought a different style model, the Graco Cargo booster seat. This one even though it isn't pink or purple, provides much more comfort for my little one."
0,"I can't believe how many great reviews this book got. It's not very good, and rates my second star only because I was curious enough to finish it. The two-dimensional characters and an overly-contrived, twisted plot prove disappointing. Several plot twists are based on the easy, convenient on ""Guess what? I lied"" - now that's a cheap device, maybe nearly as bad as ""it was all a dream.""If you want a great thriller, read Michael Connelly."

Tried it in multiple outlets (no, we weren't in the middle of a blackout), and did the obligatory jiggling of all the wires and double checking connections, but no little red light to signify receipt of power.Had to return it, luckily Amazon had extended it's return policy to January for items purchased in November.

This Northanger Abbey was not as much like her other stories. It has a little darkness in its story line, something I am not accustomed to seeing in Jane Austen stories. I must say I will not be watching this one again."
0,"I have never in my life seen a worse interpretation of a Jane Austen novel. It was as if they had taken the novel and splashed black paint all over it! I have just finished watchng it and that ghastly music is still ringing in my ears. You could not possibly like this movie if you have read the book. The acting is fake. None of the characters in this movie have any charm. How it's possible to make the most beautiful characters such as Henry Tilney and Catherine Morland so ugly is beyond me. But it's done here. I won't even mention characters such as the Marchioness, the general, and the Thorpes. This is very, very sad..."
0,"Utterly awful in every respect, from the acting to the rendition of the story to the ludicrously campy gothic setting. Get the 2007 masterpiece version instead. This one is a pathetic travesty of a wretched mockery of the novel."
0,"I must confess that I haven't yet read the book, however, I will now. The background music was, I found, very dominating, and I thought out of sync, but the atmosphere prompted me to read the book. The darkness and mordidness some of the imagined scenes did make me laugh. They make me wonder whether Catherine, a girl of that time, would really have had such vivid and wild fantasies. Overall, it was good, but I would like to have been able to make a comparison with another production, if only to see how someone else would have portrayed some parts."

0,"I was disappointed with the movie Nothanger Abbey. While I think that Peter Firth is a good actor he unfortunately got stuck acting in a bad movie. My complaints with the movie are the stupid dream scenes, the freaky looking lady with the weird makeup that made her look like a corpse and the weird crescent moon designs on her face and I was also disappointed with the actress who played Catherine. She had the same look on her face to show every kind of emotion. All she did was make these annoing loooks like making her eyes get all big and her mouth drop open into an O shape. Like she had a perpetulal look of wide eyed stares and of looking constantly shocked, startled and surprised. I realize the wide eyed stares were suspoed to show that she was young and innocent but it was annoying and got old fast!"
0,"i give this film 1 star, because no star was not an option. it was boring, disjointed and senseless. in sum, totally disappointing. a major directing and editing disaster.i find it hard to believe it was a bbc production, which are usualy top notch. with that, and the fact that i'm a jane austin groupie, i bought the film without checking the ratings. i actually watched it twice,because i was sure i had missed something. there was nothing to miss.northanger abbey is the only austin book i haven't read yet, but i am looking forward to reading it in order to find out how far off the film missed its mark. i'm sorry i can't return it--the used copies don't seem to be selling very well."

0,"This is (at best) a medium quality bootleg recording from way back in the middle of a huge audience in the coliseum of the USC campus in Los Angeles from the Soul Cages tour. This two CD set has been available since the mid-ninties and as Happy Birthday was indeed sung by a festival crowd for Sting the man was at work on his birthday. The sound quality found on these two CD's is not worthy of the high pricetag of this bootleg recording and this is very poor value for your dollar.The best way to enjoy this period of Sting and his band in a live setting would be to purchase a copy of the VHS ""Soul Cages Concert"" to have a decent audio and visual record from this tour instead of this illegal bootleg of crummy quality. Avoid this and save your money.One Star"

The sound quality was very poor, the speakers buzzed at low volume when the radio was tuned to a music station. Speaker buzz diminished somewhat when a CD was playing which suggests to me the buzzing was in the receivers circuitry. I have purchased many Bosh tools but their radio is at the other end of the quality spectrum. I give it two thumbs down. I just wasted over $200.00 If you are thinking of buying a job site or shop radio, buyer be ware......"
0,I purchased this radio NEW not reconditioned to use in my garage. I took it to two outdoor parties at my brother's house. It died after a few hours in 100 degree weather.

0,"Macbeth is one Verdi opera that you would want to own on CD--it's not performed too often. But this recording is a disappointment.It is a very strange ""live"" recording with the music interrupted by tepid applause that sounds like the stage hands were the only people around. So the applause takes up space on the disc without adding to any real sense of excitement.Christa Ludwig's performance is unpleasing. While she can belt out the tunes with the best of them, there's not a high note that she doesn't slide into and get to eventually. A much better Lady MacBeth with a fantastic range is Shirley Verrett on the Domingo/Abbado recording.And Karl Bohm's conducting makes Verdi sound like Viennese minuets--a strange feat, but not endearing for this Italian opera. All in all, quite disappointing."
0,"The premises is fairly weak to start with, you should be thinking alone the line - yeah right, that's going to happen, the product description pretty much sum up the whole movie. However, hopeful, you want to get some good laughs from the various tricks the guy used to get the girl within the 96 min runtime. Unfortunately, those schemes are not very funny, nor smart, fairly off the wall. Not much chance for acting from Rachael Leigh Cook, and Kenny Doughty, very plain silly expressions throughout, just shots after shots of young and pretty smiles. The supporting actors/actresses didn't add much either.Note that the DVD has no subtitle also, sometimes can be hard to make out what male lead said with his British accent."
0,"I usually do not write reviews, but must on this book. It is a sweet story, but it is very repetitive, and full of information that has no relation to the haunting the author is describing. I love true ghost stories, and usually read them without putting them down, until this one. I had a hard time getting through this one. The author spends most of her time talking about herself and daily tasks then about the haunting. The only reason I finished this book was because I spent money on it."

If you want to continue to use Corel Addressbook, you get a scaled-back version of it which isn't as useful as the Version 8 Addressbook. Also, I had problems with some document conversion issues.

0,"This thing is terrible. It just spins and doesnt make the ice slushy. Just gets things cold. Left on for 10 minutes. It is loud as a vacuum cleaner, wastes all the C battery power. It is too hard to clamp and unclamp. You need to be a man to do it or at least have a good grip. The spout leaks. Too many negatives. The worst is the anticipation of getting a slurpee when all you get is a mess and you have to end up going to 7 11 again and pay 2.00 for a slurpee when you thought you could get one at home. I am a regular amazon buyer and usually never write reviews but this time i had too. I dont want people to spend there money on junk."
0,"It seemed like a fun idea, since my 9 year old daughter loves slurpees. What a waste of money! There are numerous parts to assemble, and they are difficult to line up so that the gears operate properly. I spent an hour trying to get make the first slurpee before I gave up. (By the way, I followed the directions to the letter). My daughter was so disappointed, since not only did she get very little participation in making the slurpee (too complex), but then she didn't get to enjoy the drink. DO NOT BUY THIS TOY!"
0,"My son got this toy for his birthday and it did work - we used fruit punch and it froze much quicker than I thought it would. However, it would not come out of the poor spout - we had to take the whole thing apart to get the slurpee out, by that time it was melting.It only makes one small slurpee at a time and you have to replace the ice after each use - it doesn't stay frozen long enough to make more than one drink.It was a cute toy, but we did return ours due to the hassle. It wasn't worth the time for the results we received.Also, I agree with one of the other reviewers...it's more an adult toy - the only part the children can do is poor in the liquid and turn it on. It's quite a process to make one small slurpee."
0,"this semmingly exiting toy upset me. we tried to make a slurpy 3 times all having no results. my son was in the mood for a lovely slurpy, but he was discoreged when it didn't work. an over all rating of this extreimly hard to put to gether toy was a complete failer."
0,"This product has 19 steps to complete before your 1 tiny slurpee comes out (if it does)- this is after you put the machine together!

After wasting an hour, we ended up with a clogged machine (instructions say to add a 12 oz. soda but warn that this will happen with a soda with two high a sugar content- won't work at all with diet). We tried the concoction that was still in the machine- it was completely flat from processing. You would really have to experiment to find a drink that would work- not worth the effort at all!"

You can see how he can fill 944 pages without needing to go deep into the subject.If you don't know anything about networking and security and you would like to learn about it and you think hacking is ""cool"", well, then this would be an exciting book for you."
0,"This book is an excellent reference for networking / protocols etc, with a few scant comments of how these protocols are vulnerable. Most of the info in the appendixes can be found in RFC's and has been pulled straight out. The extensive list of port references as an example. The tiger tool kit looked promising for the out of the box hacker but I was suprised to see that there was only a limited edition (limited by functionality) included. Some interesting scripts and a different approach than other books I have read which was nice. Made me brush up on the network stuff but nothing you cant learn from a good tcp/ip book. All in all interesting, well written but it seems the only way you are ever going to hack anything is to build your own lab and learn it yourself."
0,"Read the reviews and understand what you're buying before you pay [price] of your hard earned money for this book.Go to a bookstore and take a minute to thumb through the pages to see what's in it. And the cd in the back of the book? Forget it - it's an eval. copy. You get a few programs that work 'out of the box' but in order to use the cd in it's entirety you have to pay an additional $5.00 at a website in order to activate the 'pro' version - LAME.I wanted so much for this book to be what it advertised. I held out hope reading page after (fluff)page. I held out hope even after reading other reviews that trashed this book. I held out hope until I popped the cd into my computer and saw that the only thing John Chirillo revealed to me was that I wasted my time and money.If you take away only one thing in this review, take this:There are no shortcuts. Buy ""Hacking Exposed"", sit down in front of the computer, and do your homework. Good Luck"
0,"When I first heard about this Film Roman-backed series, I was very excited. The discs, however, have not lived up to their potential, and ""Weird and Mysterious"" is no exception. As with the other Level13.net anthologies, the majority of pieces included on this disc are too short, too rough and too amatuer. Clearly there is promise in some of these future filmmakers (""Headdress"" is actually a lovely and stirring little piece), but if you're looking for an anthology of more polished, more professional animation, you'll need to look at the Animation Show Volume One or any of the NFB Canadian Animation collections."
0,Its so memerable I dont remember it. The plot is a little off. The time required to make this movie was wasted.
0,Can't remember why I rented this but it really is a disjointed terrible movie. Not scary or interesting at all.
0,"I purchased this product with high hopes by trying to hone in on the good reviews and not fixate on the bad ones. Unfortunately, I was disappointed when printing out a couple of pages with my new cartridge, having streak marks on every page I printed. I don't know if maybe this cartridge was a lemon, but honestly I think I rather save the time (rather than money) and just order the real deal from Cannon. Luckily, I purchased with the fulfillment from Amazon, so customer service was the best part of buying this cartridge, but I don't think I will be experimenting again anytime soon with this company."
0,"I bought two of these X25 compatible toner cartridges for a Canon 5770 printer in September 2010. I finally opened one package and put the cartridge in my printer in March 2011. Immediately it had a large black band down one side of the page, and a dim print elsewhere with a ""Toner Low"" message on the printer. Since it has been so long since I bought it, I apparently have no recourse and am out the money I spent. I haven't opened the second package yet, but am not optimistic. I have purchased X25 compatible toner cartridges through Amazon before, and have been well satisfied. The one I bought before was no longer available, so I tried this one, and it was a disaster."
0,"Took forever to get, at least 3 weeks. Very disappointed in the shipping of it. Althpugh, the packaging was good."
0,"I bought this book based on the numerous glowing reviews it has received. I was sure I was going to love it and find it very useful. I have an organic yard and attracting insects is one of my goals, so I have a fair sampling of insects that I want to identify. The pictures in this book are plentiful, but they are too small, and too blurry, and shot at weird angles so you can't see all the markings, and shot in natural light so you can't really see some of the defining features. If I didn't already know what some of the insects were, I might not be able to recognize them from the photos in the book. So, the book isn't going to help me with a quick identification of the things I'm seeing in my yard. Perhaps if you are a bug expert, this would be a good book, but it isn't what I was hoping for."
0,"The DVD's tittle is Tony Little's ""Gazelle"" Freestyle........... and the picture shows a person using the Gazelle workout machine. I thought it was a video showing different workouts on the Gazelle. Very misleading. I'm very disappointed because I didn't get what I thought I was purchasing."
0,If you read the back cover of this book then you basically know what is going to happen . However the advertised third force is a furphy and is unsatisfactorily set aside . This author has regurgitated the tired Freeman and his delta/sas team formula . The only difference is that the scenario is on a smaller scale compared to previous titles .Unfortunately the author seems have to have retained his desire to introduce sexual liasions of ludicrous and unecesary proportions into his books (Hint: Freeman scores) . This wastes time that could have been spent developing the tissue thin plot and characters.In summary: save your money and buy a proper special forces techno thriller .
0,"I received this order of pops today March 24, 2011 and was not what is pictured. I got sweet pops instead with a small label on the plastic that the box is wrapped in stating sweet and sour pops. Then when you open it you do not have equal amount of variety of pops . You get 19 cherry, 12 Strawberry, 11 grape, 5 orange and 1 blue razz berry. Misrepresentation of merchandise."
0,"Kurt Meyer's experiences in the war offer plenty of raw material for a great memoir. Unfortunately, these are marred by all-too frequent songs of praise for the Fatherland that border on the fanatical. Perhaps they accurately reflect the mentality of the time, and are therefore interesting from an historical perspective. But when this high-ranking German officer, sentenced to prison for his role in the massacre of Canadian prisoners of war following the D-Day invasion, cries out about the bravery of his beloved troops and their dedication to carry on the fight in the face of overwhelming odds ... well, it sounds delusional to me. Better to read ""The Forgotten Soldier"" by Guy Sajer to get a more believable perspective on what the German soldier thought about the war."
0,"There are two things that will really say what's wrong with this video. One is that it advertises that there is 100% never-before-seen footage, but EVERYTHING on the video was shown in the episodes they aired on TV (except maybe some of the confessionals and the outtakes). And the other thing is...well, I guess MTV has a different definition for ""uncensored"" than everyone else has, because everything is censored, even profanity in the dialogue. This video is false advertising. Don't buy it."
0,"I went into this movie thinking that it would be unsensored and show new and improved pieces, but that was just a crock!"
0,A complete waste of time. Out of date coverage that tells you nothing. Spend the money on a can of lager and stay in playing with all the shareware plug-ins available on the net. You'll learn far more! Sorry.
0,"Although the product description stated it was PC/MAC compatable, it was not. It did not operate as it should on my granddaughter's MAC system. When she switched it over to the PC, it worked fine and she enjoyed it. I attempted to contact the company that produced the Jump Start but had major difficulty finding anything."
0,"Mostly taking part in Minnesota, it didn't seem to portray the high caliber of dancing that is out there. The vintage scenes from 30's were the best part of the tape. The caliber of dancing by the locals, while competent, is easily surpassed in other swing communities that could provide a better setting for a video like this. Would be better showing dance scenes from more cities around the country. Has an amusing quality to it that makes it a fun watch, kind of like watching a good'ol kitschy B-Movie."
0,This product is not compatible with Windows XP Media Center Edition. Wasted many days to figure out. Should have mentioned in the product requirements/description. Too bad that I am returning it back.
0,"I used this device with the Roland MT-32 on Windows XP. With either the built-in Microsoft driver or the latest EMU driver downloaded from their website, SysEx messages were not conveyed to the MT-32, resulting in music playing with incorrect instruments. Currently, I am using the M-Audio Uno sans driver and having no problems."
0,The first half is entertaining. But I'm not sure if it has educational value. The second half is very very bad. The doctor in psychology who gives instructions is very unappealing. He has not even smile once in his about 10 minute lecture. I'm wondering how any child can stand watching such a face.
0,"First, I think Terry Pratchett is a masterful writer. Second, cat fanciers are boring when enraptured by the small furry pests despite being masterful writers. This is no Discworld, I did not find it entertaining enough to bother to read the whole thing. Ansel Adams probably would bore you with photos of his kids. Speilburg would probably bore you with his home movies."
0,"I am a sixth grader, our class just read the book Hatchet, and watched the movie ""Cry In the Wild. I recommend the book over the movie. The book had better details then the movie. Instead of a moose attack in the book, the movie had a bear attack. I liked the book much better. I give the movie a 1/2 star out of 5."
0,"I am a fifth grader and watched this movie in class. My whole class and I agree that it was graphic. There was lots of blood and nude scenes. I think it should have been a PG-13 rating, and shouldn't be shown in elementary or middle school. It is more violent and bloody than the movies my older brother and my mom watch. It was a MAJOR disappointment."
0,"I'll cut right to the chase. I hated this movie. We had read the book Hatchet (by Gary Paulsen) in class, and this was the movie of it. The name was changed for box office purposes. This movie is not worthy of the plot of Hatchet. The movie people messed up the plot, and Brain had no character. The story was nothing without Paulsen's touch. If you've read the book, spare yourself the agony. If you haven't read the book, don't bother with the movie."
0,This novel took two good plot lines that could have stood on their own and clumsily combined them into one novel and ruined both in doing so. Very disappointing. How could you possibly go wrong with Nazis and Michaelangelo? Paul Christopher found a way! Nice!
0,"Instead of reading a thrilling and suspenseful story, I instead had to read numerous, graphic references to the main character's body. I lost count of how many times the author described her breasts. It was silly, distracting, and a waste of time.I'm not usually so harsh when reviewing a book, but really, there was no point to this book. The plot dragged, it was simply not suspenseful, and the author came off sounding like an over sexed teenaged boy."
0,"My lil 3 mth old was hurt after he kicked the swimming fish, he kicked off the toy and was crying as 1/2 his body was off the hard plastic frame. I thought it was cute because of the swimming fish, but not a good toy for a baby or infant. We're sending back to fisherprice. I think this toy will be recalled soon. I'm disappointed since now my baby is 3 mths and I could have bought a better toy."
0,"My daughter never really did much with this toy. The ""wheel"" of the boat just turns (nothing for the child to do) and the toys that attach are boring. My daughter preferred to play with those toys on their own. This toy just really misses the mark."
0,"I took this product back because the fabric doesn't fit the base of the toy as well as the base is very hard and uncomfortable for a baby; especially an infant.The other thing that I did not like about it, is the fact it doesn't fold up to make it easy to store. You have this huge piece of plastic always on your den floor."
0,Very noisy. Didn't work half the time. Very small and boring too. Poor quality. Took it back and got another brand. Much happier now.
0,"I honestly thought this would be a great movie - maybe with a similar compelling punch as ""Stand By Me"" or something to that order. But it lacked so much that I had to fast-forward more than half of the movie, and I tend not to do that with sentimental or growing-up movies. If you haven't watched this movie, you have missed nothing."
0,"This suitcase fell apart on me after a SINGLE use on one vacation - two non-stop flights. This didn't face a lot of wear and tear, yet it fell apart anyway. Don't bother buying this crap. Either buy the really cheap stuff that you know will fall apart anyway or spring for the nicer range of luggage that you know will last..."
0,"Second trip with this bag and it is already rendered useless... I'm not even hard on these things. The interior did fine minus the zipper on the inside which broke immediately but it's the handle that I am really upset with. I'm not sure what time of metal or plastic that is but it's pathetic. A 28"" bag holding about 50lbs you would think that the handle would be a higher grade than this! Anyway, fixing this doesn't even seem worth it to me, I think I'll quit looking for a good deal and find some more durable pieces of luggage. I guess since I'm rating luggage here I might as well throw out a couple that have been very successful for me; they're both Eddie Bauer. Shame on you SwissGear for putting out such low-grade luggage!"

0,"Well yes, it has some very first appearances of classic marvel villains but the artwork is obviously not worth the money. Only two or three story are visually appealing and entertaining. The cost DEFINITELY does not justify the returns."

0,"A great book (worth 5 stars easily) is totally ruined by the formatting mistakes (or rather, lack of formatting) and the amazing number of misspelled words in it (thus the one star rating). Apparently, it was done by someone who doesn't know how to read or how to format sentences or paragraphs. Extremely disappointing. I hope Piers lays into whoever did this."
0,This is my least favorite Curve ever!!! Smells like soap only! It's a strong smell and will last a few hours but it's nothing like the original Curve which none of the newer one's will ever beat! Would never buy this again and I have had it for years since I don't use it much!!! For this price just buy the original or try a different one!
0,As a photographer I can not remember the last time I sat on the beach in my bathrobe during a shoot. If I acted as this guy does in his instructional video I am sure I would be sued or thrown in jail for abusing animals. This work is a travesty and a mockery to photographers.

0,"The best defense is a good offense and John's book tries to help plan that offense. It is important to be wary of those around you and know how to protect your assets from unexpected breaches in security. Statistics show that the most serious security breaches are internal attacks (trusted employees) rather than external, but it is important to be prepared for both. This book aims to help network security people do just that but falls short of its goal. This book is a good attempt at teaching security, but doesn't quite make the grade."
0,"Router setup was fairly easy and it worked like a charm for the first 2-3 months. Then, I began having intermittent wireless connectivity issues (connection would drop or worse, I couldn't connect at all). Issue was definitely with the router.Netgear support (phone and e-mail) was pathetic at best (and costly if you are out of the first 90 days). Their solutions never worked and they never offered to replace the router.In the end, this was a complete waste of money. I decided to purchase the Belkin Pre-N router, which has worked like a charm and has incredible range."
0,This router has been trouble from day 1. I've had problems with the router dropping [wireless] connections from the get-go. The router also loses IP addresses at an alarming rate. Virtually non-functional. Support from NETGEAR is non-existent.
0,My previous router went out and a bought this cheap one to use until my ISP started making it mandatory to use there routers here in the next month or so. I have had this router about 2 months and it is crap. As others have said it randomly drops connections. At first it was everyone once in a while. the last few days it has been every few minutes at times. Now i will have to replace this modem again. If you dont have the option to get a modem from your ISP spend the money and buy a good one. These cheap ones arent worth the headache.
0,"I bought a net gear router a few years ago. It took me and my roomate, who are both fairly computer literate, multiple calls to the Indian technicians to configure this router. I just pulled it out of storage and have run into the same problems. If I want to spend all day learning how this piece of crap works I probably could make it go. I tried calling tech support to get pointed in the right direction and have found out my 90 day warranty is up and I am on my own unless I want to spend another $70. I have dealt with other routers and never ran into as many problems as I have with netgear. If I am going to spend another $70 it won't be with netgear.NETGEAR BLOWS!"
0,"Like many others, first crack at the router was easy and simple. Plugged it in and worked. After a month or so, it got buggy, and eventually, could not access its setup page. It's been sitting there since collecting dust as I've given up with netgear's product support. Fast forward to a month ago and bro arrives with another wgr614 v4. Same thing, works great then dies on you. Bro, a google systems/network manager, worked for hours on end trying to troubleshoot, but unfortunately, to no avail. NETGEAR, WHEN WILL YOU HELP US?!??!?!?!? I say we band together, spread the word, and bring down Netgear!"

0,"I bought a WGR614 at the beginning of November. Everyday I have to reboot the device by cycling its power. The symptoms are:No routing;No wireless, or slow wireless;No response to ICMP pings;No response to web configuration;Status lights do not indicate a problem;No DHCP server.These symptoms sometimes appear in different combinations. I switched the DHCP service to a conventional server so that I would not lose TCP/IP services on Ethernet.I have called NetGear's India support line four times. Everytime I call they suggest the same troubleshooting steps (push the reset button). They apparently do not have the capability of tracking customer issues--they just read from a script. I am attempting to get an advance exchange for a replacement unit. If NetGear will not exchange the unit, I will try the distributor.While reading these reviews, I notice that the negative reviews are frequently rated less than helpful, while the positive reviews are generally rated helpful. Hmm...."
0,"This was my first router, and I found the configuration menus on this product to be easy to use, with nice detailed descriptions of options. HOWEVER, as some of the other reviews have hinted, it is often necessary to reset (power cycle) the router. Either DHCP fails at the beginning of a session, or it cuts out during operation. Assigning fixed IP addresses to local computers helps, but it will still cut out from time to time. Latest firmware upgrade seems to make things a bit worse. (outsourced firmware? haha)"
0,The router seemed to work fine in the beginning but then I upgraded the firmware to the latest version 5.02 and the router has now gone bad. I have much lost time trying to resolve this and now have to pay shipping fees to send out the bad router for RMA. This does not seem fair since the router is only 4 months old. I will be very wary of Netgear products in the future.
0,Suffered drops in connection from day one and after two weeks it has seemingly shut down for business. I'm not a techie so I don't understand why I can connect to the internet via my neighbours's wireless connection through my apt wall but not to my Netgear router two feet away from me. It's a crazy world.
0,"I would not recommend this router to anyone. At first it worked okay even with sporadic connections. I could never hold connection steady for a few hours. It was constantly disconnecting and looking for connection. If you are like me who listens to online radio and that would cause a constant problem of disconnecting and connecting again and again. The worst happened after 7 months, when it completely stopped working. I am not sure what to recommend as I had two wired Linksys routers which only lasted 12 months each. I don't know what the problem with them but they simply stopped working. So look else where for your router needs. Help Support is non-existent with both linksys and netgear. If this things goes down, you pretty much on your own."
0,I bought this WGR614 router from Best Buy on 12/27/2010. Now today 7/12/2012 the power supply cord failed. I connected another power supply and the router works again. Went shopping for a new power supply cord at RadioShack and it costs $24.00. $24 Bucks for a cord when a replacement router is $23.49 from a 3rd party seller at Amazon!!!!Why after only a 1- years would the power supply fail? It has no moving parts??So much for buying Netgear routers. Today I bought a Belkins N300 as Netgear lost this customer.Belkin N300 Wireless N Router (Latest Generation)Thanks Amazon for giving me the platform to voice my opinion.
0,This Netgear router worked flawlessly for me for ONE year. After that it intermittently would loose wireless connection.
0,"I installed it easily enough, but nothing worked. I couldn't connect to VPN network and web pages crawled.

I returned it and bought a linksys."
0,"I had continual problems with my netgear products and spent over 40 hours on with their customer service (Customer service is in Delhi, India, and I was constantly frustrated by the lack of ability to communicate). I finally threw the product away and bought Linksys, and have been happy ever since!"
0,"This is the 2nd time I have had Netgear Router and 3rd Netgear Product. First Router I bought was 2.5 years ago. I don't remember the model number but it was 802.11b only, not G. It was OK, but the connection used to drop every once in a while. We had to reboot it to reestablish connection.I bought this WRG614 a year ago, and couple days after setting it up, the connection dropped and the only way to reestablish the connection was rebooting the router. Since then, this occurs on average twice a week. I have to reboot the router every time. I didn't mind rebooting so far but, I am thinking of getting a VOIP phone service and this router is not reliable. I can lose calls and faxes if the connection drops and I am not in front of the computer to realize connection drop.Bottom line is that I have a word to not to buy netgear product again. I will try linksys routers. I definetely recommend you to stay away from Netgear routers."
0,"Netgear has great exterior design, however, its hardware inside is totally useless. It frequently stop working in higher temperature, by that, I mean 70F, especially when more than one people connect to it. It works fine for a while (but still slower than its optimal speed) after replug the power cord. However, I still need to replug it at lease once a day. And it's not just my netgear have problem like that, but also my friend's and the dialing one (different model, but with the same issue) in my apartment. So before Netgear fixes this problem, I won't buy any netgear router for a while."
0,"Just couldn't get this to work for me, even after spending an hour with Netgear's technical support. For some reason, even though I was connected to it, I couldn't access the internet (even though I could access the internet if I connected directly to my dsl modem). Luckily I purchased this from Fry's, so I'll be returning it and looking at some other alternative."
0,"This router is a piece of junk. For the price, you can do much better. It's ok under the most simple and basic of uses, but during load or even a simple nmap scan the router just chokes."
0,"I've had the Netgear wireless router for a three months and it has been nothing but a problem. It constantly hangs such that I have to reload each web page. I've checked my laptop and the wireless capability works great. Even when I sit next to the Netgear router, it is constantly dropping the connection. I often have to reboot the router by unplugging it. If I hardwire into the router, the performance is great, but doesn't that defeat its purpose?!?!? This unit is heading for eBay."
0,"Had worked well for nearly a year.Except that Netgear was about the last manufacturer to support WPA, which was annoying.Anyway, after about a year of quietly working in my closet, where nobody touches it and it doesn't suffer from much temperature fluctuation, it broke. The uplink port doesn't work any more. I switched in Apple's Airport Express and that worked fine.If you buy one of these, and they *are* relatively cheap, KEEP THE RECEIPT! You won't be able to get service without it.Also note that their service is in India and weren't very helpful (although they tried to be) when I called asking about WPA.You get what you pay for, I guess. I won't be cheaping out on the replacement. Apple for me."
0,"After a convoluted set-up, this unit continued to be hassle with constantly dropped signals. Eventually the WGR614 became a waypoint between the modem and my laptop which was connected with a 20' cable back to the router. Lucky I had the cable or else I would have continued to lose work! For multiple laptops and a powerful signal spend $20 more and buy a Linksys. Sorry Netgear."
0,"After receiving the 2nd shipment of this item, coz Neatgear tech support decided the 1st one was defective, it didnt work neither.

So please beware."
0,"Despite insistence it can serve as access point, was unable to set up as such and technical support was horrible."
0,You get what you pay for. Password protection and encryption process is a convoluted mess. Save yourself the trouble. Pay the extra and buy a Linksys or Apple router. Will never buy a Linksys product again.
0,"Everyday is a different story with this product. Some days I connect with good signal, other days I can't connect 5 feet away from the router. I've been on the phone for hours with tech support and although they try to help, they haven't been able to get the unit working consistently. Also, the documentation is very weak and the website offers little help. Overall, I DON'T recommend this product. Stay away."
0,I bought this router from Fry's Electronics for almost $100. I constantly have to reboot it and sometimes it goes striaght to netgears home page for no reason. Until recently when it stopped working all together! I didn't even have it for 6 months! I would not reccommend this router for anyone who uses a wireless connection a lot.
0,it was not able to reset and i was unable to get the internet hooked up to it. wasted valuable time trying to figure it out
0,"Don't get carried away by the sleek design. It worked fine for a week and then the wireless component stopped working. 2-3 times a week, the router needs to be restarted. And, after 6 months, it was permanently dead. Then, finally had to replace this router. Not sure, how long this new piece would survive. Absolutely, no - no."
0,"This was the first router I bought and it was recommended by the Best Buy employee I talked to. The installation was pretty easy and for a month this router worked excellent. I had great range and it was reliable. Then one day (about a month after I bought it) my wireless internet connection didn't work. I didn't know what the problem was, but after resetting the settings, I had decent connection again. Unfortunately this problem keeps reoccuring and about once week I lose my wireless connection causing me to reset the settings each time. Its kind of annoying to be honest.Overall this is a good router when right, but outside of a month it hasn't been reliable for me. I guess I would look for an alternative router if I were you."
0,"Needed to upgrade my 2yr old .11b router(netgear 814) because I was having trouble connecting to it with my new laptop. So I bought this little puppy. And then the headache began .............the wireless was DOA .....wired connection worked fine(desktop PC) but the wireless didnt work at all!!!!! my laptops saw the network but wouldnt connect my wireless bridge(netgear)wouldnt connect either. switched to d-link di524 and its all love now.I must say this though I was a fan of netgear products but having to constantly reset there products (also have the ps121 and the ma101) every so often is a killer, frankly its quite annoying."
0,Although the documentation says that you can stop this product from broadcasting the SSID the option is not available when you try to do it. Netgear support has confirmed this is a problem and said that it is releasing new firmware but can't confirm the date. This is a very basic security feature that should be available on all wireless routers. I would not purchase until new firmware is released.
0,"I bought this router from BestBuy in October since then I have had to call tech support 3 times. The calls are routed to India and the support stops there. The problems were not easy fixes. All tech support calls last at least 2 hours and the last go around I was told a Senior Tech Support Specialist would call me because the ""low tech specialist"" could not determine how to fix it. They never called back in addition my warranty expires in 5 days. Buyer Beware"
0,"Unlike many routers this one doesn't allow you to navigate to 192.168.1.1 and punch in your important info. Instead, this router wants you to navigate to routerlogin.[net] or somesuch nonsense. But that's not what drove me bonkers. The insurmountably erratic wireless performance is what drove me bonkers. I tried for a couple of days and returned it. I had this same problem with another of these routers but wrote the badness off to microwave towers in the area - that's not the problem. It's just a crummy router. I went with the Linksys which set up in 5 minutes and has worked flawlessly."
0,"Too bad Amazon doesn't have 0 (ZERO) star for it's review rating. Because this product deserve a 0 star. I should have checked Amazon's review before buying this router.The setup is very easy but unfortunately the wireless functionality doesn't work. Some of the problems:1. IP Address assignment many times got messed up.2. Wireless router never work when 2 computers are connected.3. When only 1 wireless is connected, the wireless router coughs a lot (intermitten connection).With this product, you will never know when you will be connected to the Internet. In summary, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
0,"We have had this for over 2 years & I just can't take it anymore - We lose connection DAILY. We are continually updating the software, but to no avail.Netgear blames the issues on Windows updates, but no matter what we do the connections are always lost.I am finally throwing it away & going with a non-Netgear product.FYI - We use Comcast cable. We recently added cabel phone service. The Lost Connection happened before & after adding the phone service."
0,"Some facts: (1) the paperback has 154 pages - large type and double spaced. (2) Pages 127 - 147 deal with the author's life, education and pilot training/service and have nothing to do with UFOs at Roswell. (3) a significant portion of the book is composed of conversations that the Shirkey 'invented'. Quoting Shirkey on page 19 [""The author, who did not witness these conversations among various officers, composed the narration...Military personnel will recognise that the dialogue could be true based on the actions taken and the results.""]. As far as I can tell, the title of the book, ""I Was There"", only applies to him standing at the Operations Desk of the Roswell Air Field with Colonel Blanchard while some men walked past with cardboard boxes of [""aluminum-looking metal pieces""] and then onto a B-29 aircraft. Don't get me wrong - anything that adds to our knowledge of what happened in 1947 at Roswell is great, but this book adds very little of substance."
0,"The reason I bought this dvd was because it was compared to The Shield. NOt a chance. Aside from the very corny storyline (first two hours anyway), even though it was in English (somewhat) it was very hard to undersand. And there was no close caption.. I suffered through almost two hours and then just had to stop watching. I dont know whose idea it was to compare it to the Shield, but to me this was a total waste of $41.00."
0,"This is a book of lists; there is no details behind anything, no extra information. Many of the chosen topics are very interesting and are great to share with friends (especially if your friends are semi-intelligent fifteen year olds, like mine).But, the book is short and your jollys end quickly. Because of the lack of background material provided, it doesn't really help if you want to refrence it for an essay or project.You could also easily research some of these things in about an hour, and it would all cost you signifacantly less than the $10-12 this book usually sells for."
0,I recently purchased this DVD along with Gordon Lightfoot Live in Reno. It is exactly the same as the Reno DVD. I didn't need to buy both. Your customers should be aware of this. The Reno DVD is dearer but better quality.
0,"I wouldn't recommend this battery. It worked well the first few times, but no longer holds a charge. Even when it did, it was really only good for no more than 2 hours with intermittent video recording and photos. My OEM battery at least lasts longer. Save your money."
0,"Of course none of this stuff is supported by any evidence or ""facts"". This material is nothing more than speculation, innuendo and rumour. Secrets societies exist - no question there. But to say they're controlling virtually everything, including plaques and wars is nonsense and goofey in my mind. And to say alien beings from other worlds are involved - whew...Where is the evidence Mr Bramely?"
0,This was pretty much a dumb idea. I kept hoping that it would get better.. but it never did.. It pains me to waste money on junk.. and that's what I did.. threw my money away.. Thanks alot Laymon..
0,"I teach a college/career Sunday School Class and purchased this DVD because it looked like a great tool for my class. What a waste of money. Just three people, sitting at a table discussing the Bible. There's no discussion material and it's incredibly boring to watch. Definitely not a tool for a Bible Study Class. Vey disappointed."
0,Do not buy this set. It's a shameless double dip. There is a better 6 disc set released more than 2 years ago. Plus now Fox has given Live Free Or Die Hard a PG-13 rating. Do not let them take advantage of Die Hard fans everywhere.
0,"I did not enjoy this film, nor did I come away with some sort of profound insight into anything. The photography is good and the actors are, I realize, all well-trained and capable. The wintry weather is captured well by the film crew, so it is, at times, visually appealing. However, I could not find one character that I really cared for. for me, this movie was somewhat like Revolutionary Road, which was just too shallow. Elena (Joan Allen) was hard to feel anything for. The only time I did feel something for her was when she rode the bike to the drugstore and stole the merchandise. It was definitely a plea of some sort, but then it sort of just stopped right there. I guess you could stay that I would have enjoyed to have seen all of the characters more developed. So, at the end, it was simply a disappointment to me and left me.....brrrrrr........chilly, numb and hungry for more."
0,There is this family. It's cold and there is an ice storm.Everybody is so self absorbed that they forget to feed the dog.The dog gets pissed off and kills the entire family. The dog runs outside and slips on the ice.
0,"As a book, Rick Moody's The Ice Storm was a fitting testimony to some of the harsh realities of being a `baby-boomer'. The indulgence, the confusion, the dysfunction--told with reverence, painfully, honestly. Good enough.But there's some artsy know-it-alls in New York who are just the right age, to have been on the wrong end of the 70's -and they further want to show us how bad they had it. They are selfish, small people. And we're so tired of their act, that we hardly listen to them anyway. So they scream louder. And we could really care less.So they make a movie about their pain. Which to them is the loudest scream they can make. And we really could care less.Wasted on this effort are some first rate talent, Kevin Kline should be perfect, as should Sigourney Weaver and Joan Allen, and as maestro who better than Ang Lee, the artisan to craft this work? All wasted.Instead of painfully honest, it's just painful. Stay away if you can."
0,"Not only is the book much better than the movie, as is almost always the case, but the movie is also an insult to the book. The book has a lot of intelligence and insight, whereas the movie practically makes the entire story into a series of lucky happenstances.In the film, the villain is turned into a one-dimensional stick figure. This is enough to ruin the story by itself, but the movie's omission of the ""oracle"" subplot removes any source of wonder or realization. It's just another overly long, moody, Costner-saves-the-world-mostly-through-brooding picture.David Brin, I'm sorry that Hollywood didn't do your book justice."

0,Wish i could tell you how i like this item but since amazon couldnt get it to me on time i never bought it! I ordered this item in the beginning of December and amazon stated that they could get this to me by december 17th. I paid extra shipping on all of my items so this item would definately get to me before christmas then amazingly amazon e-mailed me and told me they would send THIS ITEM TO ME ON JANUARY 28TH!!!! LITTLE TOO LATE DONT YOU THINK?!?!?What kills me is that i could have went to barnes and nobles and bought this book for the same price and NOT have had to pay $50 extra for shipping! ARGH!!!Thanks amazon!Mike
0,"This is my experience with these gloves.After the first use I could already notice considerable wearing down in the left glove across the whole grip area. After the third use, the left glove had huge holes on the three middle fingers on the area covering them.Consider that I'm not even a big guy (only 155 lbs) so it's not like I lift too heavy!I''m pretty sure it's not a size mismatch case because the gloves fit perfectly (medium)... they are snug but not too tight!"

0,"I rented this video expecting something more interesting. Instead, all this movie provides is thick Irish Accents, an annoying child, and an extremely slow moving plot. The cast was wasted in what could have been a moving, intelligent film. Instead, poor direction and an unimaginative screenplay bring this film down into the depths of doom. I would not recommend this film, to anyone."

0,Didnt do anything for me has 1g thyroid med and I need over 100gDidnt work for me...Worth trying I guess though..
0,"I tried this after reading many reviews, and wanting to treat my hypothyroid condition naturally.This was a total waste. I didn't feel any differently, and it didn't help me at all. I can not and will not recommend this.The company also claims that they have a refund policy; well, no they don't. I was run around in circles trying to get my refund, was told you have to wait this long, then you have to do it in this time frame, and so on and so forth. So if it doesn't work for you. Don't expect to get your money back."
0,"this was just plain awful. I picked up the book after watching a couple of episodes of True Blood. This is one of the rare cases where the show is better than the book. The book has no plot, no character development, no allure. The only thing the book has to offer was sex. In fact, I felt as if she was shoving it down our throats. If you're interested in a true vampire love story, check out the Twilight series by Stephenie Meyer."
0,"I was not at all amazed by the 2nd book. It took me awhile to get into the 1st book but after I did I was excited to start the 2nd. This book was a real let down! For those that really like the HBO series - don't read this book! After reading this, I no longer want to watch the series. I definetly won't be wasting my time reading anymore of this series!"
0,"After hearing much praise being heaped on the author and this series, and being a fan of the earlier Anita Blake novels, I decided to give this book a try. Bad mistake on my part.I'm not sure what other reviewers have seen in this book, but I found it poorly written, utterly unimpressive and Charlaine's prose a little ... odd. (Perhaps a too-charitable word for dialogue like ... ""I don't have enough experience with the different characteristics of the many strains of Asians to tell you where he came from originally."" Like, wow. Strains of viruses, sure. But Asians?)"

0,"A Scientific Fiction is supposed to be read as a fiction! This book is rich of all kinds of scientific details about immigration to Mars, unfortunately, it makes extremely boring reading. Sure, this book will give you a lot of knowledge about Mars, but why not just read it on Nature? A technicial manual is not a fiction for leisure reading."
0,"I'm still trying to read this one. It's got just enough story that I want to find out what happens, but there's so much boring detail to drag through that it's taking forever. I try reading a paragraph, but then get distracted by a speck of dust on my desk that's tremendously more interesting than reading yet another two-page description of yet another crater. Which, boringly enough, is exactly like the last crater, except this one's a little bit bigger. Or maybe it's smaller. Or has a different mineral composition. I'm really not sure, as I'm learning to skip ahead as soon as anyone drives into or flies over a crater.If the science part of sci-fi appeals to you more than the fiction part (far, far more), this is a great book. But if you like the fiction aspect better, or even just want a balance, you're probably best just skipping this one."
0,"A good read I'm revisiting after 15 years as a way of learning to read comfortably on the iPhone Kindle client.The conversion is quite disappointing. Line breaks/word spacing is atrociously handled and ellipses become something like ""Blah blah blah. .."", but the real issue is that there are particularly bad typos left and right.""Precious"" instead of ""previous"", ""-"" instead of ""="" in equations.... I would have followed up purchased the sequel (Green Mars) in the Kindle edition had it not been for the dense stream of meaning-changing typos present in this freebie.I sincerely hope this isn't a sign of things to come for other print-to-kindle conversions!!!! Amazon -- this is a featured freebie to show off your platform with a famous-within-its-niche book... can you get it right?"
0,"I loved the concept, an epic series of colonizing Mars - but the book rambles endlessly. I don't need to be taught pseudo-science on terraforming. Just tell me the basics and I'll willingly suspect my disbelief. I don't need pages of math & science - it doesn't add to the literary value.I had no interest in the other books in the series."
0,"Not even close. I bought the series based on the Nebula and Hugo Awards. What a HUGE mistake....and I will never trust those particular award juries again. This guy does not have much to say, but says it repeatedly, exhaustively, and ad nauseum. The characters are exclusively two dimensional, all lacking passion and driven by inexplicable logic to actions that make little sense. The extensive descriptive narrative is mind numbing and filled with geological jargon. You spend most of the book wading through this blah blah blah, and when something finally does happen, it is disappointinly anti-climactic. I will never buy another piece of literature by this author."
0,what happen too you christina milian. ive liked your first cd a whole lot but this album sucks. and it's about time you lost your hard talent and your very hot black hair.
0,"Christina Millian is real indecisive about her music.she doesn't know wether to be a sexy urban R&B diva,or a safe sugar pop princess.not to put her in a label box or anything but she just seems to go where ever the trend wind blows.wether her indecisiveness is her fault or not is unknown but her latest album ""its about time"" suffers from this.kinda like brandy's never say never album of 98.rantings aside dip it low is a great song for obvious reasons.if she sticks with that formula she'll have consistant sales.because well obviously sex sells doesn't it? however that doesn't mean the songs the best in the world cause its sexual.the rest of the album is pop and R&B like i thought it would be.and Christina Millian's sexuality on this album is about as convinsing as a conservative catholic school girl trying to be a stripper.i just don't know what Christina Millian is trying to be,neither does this album"
0,"After listening to 'Dip It Low,' you would figure that this would be a good dance Pop/R&B; album. You would be horribly wrong. The album lacks everything, from depth and melody, to organization and reason. Though not so great, there are a few good songs that stand out.1. Dip It Low- Catchy and cool. 8/10.2. I Need More- Too many sounds going on. 3/10.3. Whateva U Want- Good, but too average. 6/10.4. Someday One Day- Better. 7/10.5. Highway- Different and sexy. 6/10.6. I'm Sorry- No melody or organization. 4/10.7. Get Loose- Slick dance track. 7/10, but plain.8. L.O.V.E.- Different with an 80`s vibe, but a little much at times. 7/10.9. Peanut Butter Jelly- Horrible. 2/10.10. Miss U Like Crazy- Just good. 6/10.11. Oh Daddy- Emotional, but good. 6/10.62/110- 56%: ** - **1/2"
0,"Garbage Garbage Garbage Garbage Garbage who bought this cd and liked it??????? Dont Hype Garbage I like R and B but this is garbage and who is Joe Budden, please do not buy this album for the song dip it low just buy the single!!!!!!!"
0,"""Dip It Low"" is the only reasonably catchy song here. The rest is pure, unmitigated filler that can never even hope to meet up with today's standards of enjoyable pop music. Instead of making one hit and then slavishly slopping together an album, they should have maybe released the single and then waited a long time to put together an album so it would actually be consistently good."
0,I bought the Milwaukee brand because of it's reputation. I'm very disapointed with the one I got. It would pull away from a guide bar on the right and bend the blade toward a guide bar on the left. Took it to an authorized Milwaukee repair shop twice and sent it back the factory once. It still won't cut straight. Will donate it to a resale store and try a different brand this time.
0,"There are too many other good books out there (by Sandra Brown and others) to even waste your time on this one. It's flat, and not to mention silly. I didn't like either or the main characters, it just didn't do it for me. I believe this was Sandra's first novel (don't quote me). If it was, I'll give her credit, it was not bad for a first. But like I said, just leave it on the shelf and move on."

0,I have been using a Garmin III+ for years and received the 760 as a present. Out of the box it didn't work properly. It was over 100 yards off sitting in my front yard. Compared to an almost 9 year old unit it was using fewer satalites and had an error over 300' versus less than 20' om the old unit. I tried to use it from home to work and it routed me on a road that did not exist. In fact the only turn close was the driveway of a house over 20 years old. To add insult it locked up after about 5 miles and I had to cycle power to get it to reboot. I called Magellan and managed to spend half an hour on the phone talking to someone that could not speak English and could only rely instructions. The end result was that I would have to return it to the point of purchase. I am returning it to Amazon and it will be replaced with a Garmin unit. Bad product and worst service.
0,"Works well for 3 months, then problems arose. Touch sensitive screen just broke when it became loose from its frame. Won't work completely afterwards. These roadmates are completely garbage that are assembled and made in Thailand. I'll never ever buy a magellan again. Their customer care doesnt care."
0,"The first one I ordered would not turn on. The second one was great, while it worked. It helped me get to all the events during a school competition in another city. It tells you when to change lanes, when to turn and reads the street names. Magellan was recommended to me by my father who has had tried many of the various in car and add on GPS systems.After returning home, I did not use the system for several weeks. When I did, the GPS was not pinpointing my location on the correct street. I rebooted the unit, and it became stuck on the start-up screen and would not respond to anything- even the power off button."
0,"I purchased a 760 in 2006, with the promise that updates would be available on a regular basis. Several times in 2007, the unit itself prompted me to go to magellangps.com for new updates, but the website said each time that the update woldn't be available until ""x"", X being a few months in the future.But yesterday, there WAS an update available. For $80 (well, I could live with that if it was a good update), but - a really, really HUGE but - it was NOT available by download, and the DVD they offered could ONLY BE USED ON A PC!!I was stunned, and called their customer support, which confirmed that I COULD NOT UPDATE THE UNIT ON AN APPLE COMPUTER!What a HUGE ripoff. I now have a $300 paperweight . . .never again!!"
0,"Had the unit now for 2 years, Dec '05. The unit works well. Only complaint is no updates on the maps until Dec '07. But I keyed in an extra digit during product registration, and that is what the unit uses to ""unlock"" the device to update the map. So far 3 phone calls in a week to the ""help"" line, and nothing as to helping me out. I may have paid the upgrade fee for nothing ! Advice- if you do not need support, buy Magellan. If you may need some help - keep looking. I know my next unit will not be Magellan."
0,"Bought new Roadmate 700 in 2003 at Circuit City. Worked well until I upgraded this year with Roadmate 760. Locks up, difficult to obtain satellite signal, touch features do not work, etc. Worst problem is complete lack of support from Magellan (Thales Navigation). They do not answer Emails and when you call their number you get hooked up to Rashid in India (after hours on the phone). Rashid gave me the wrong address in Texas. Mailed the unit to Ft. Hood, should have Ft. Worth. Another month wasted.If Magellan the explorer used this unit which bears his name, he would still be wandering aimlessly somewhere on the seas."

0,"While some of what Dr. Schank condemns about schools is valid, he is too ready to dismiss them as irrelevant to children's education. There are creative and committed teachers who do far more than teach ""test taking"", and his broad condemnation of schools does nothing to encourage their efforts on our children's behalf. He also dismisses literature as an ""unnecessary subject"" and Gardener's theory of multiple intelligences as a ""politically correct view of intelligence"", suggesting that reading and math are the only subjects worth learning. This narrow view of what constitutes education and expertise lessens his credibility as an educational ""expert""."

0,"I used this rack for roasting a whole chicken - usually at 325 degrees, so the oven is not usually that hot. The first use seemed to be OK, but after the second through fourth use, the paint started to peel off when I washed it (always washed it by hand). Now it's pretty bad and most of the paint has come off of the base and on parts of the bars. I decided to buy one of the silver ones from Amazon, so hopefully, that one will last. I just threw this black one out and can't recommend the black ones at all."
0,The size and function of this rack are great. The black finish started coming off after the first use even though it was used and cleaned pretty gently. I am concerned about getting black paint on my food and the prospect of it starting to rust very quickly.

0,"I bought this tricycle for my son, who is almost three. He loves it, but it is a hazard for him to ride. The front wheel is not attached securely, and the plastic part that holds it together is either defective or poorly designed. I am writing a letter to the company complaining. Also, the plastic white part of the front wheel falls off whenever we hit a small bump in the sidewalk. If the price seems too good to be true, it really is-- save your money for better quality."
0,"My son loves the trike. It is cute, stylish, and the push bar is great when he ""lets"" use it. But when he rides it himself it falls over with every turn. He has benn scratched and bruised from this fatal flaw. I reccomend it be recalled."
0,"Not quite sure where to start... Within one day, the wheel hubs began to squeak, then screech. It's very, very loud! The geometry of the frame assembly is quite unsafe. If the handlebars are turned all the way while moving forward, the tricycle tips over. This is even true if the parent is pushing with the handle. Be sure to only go slow and keep BOTH hands on the handle to either prevent tip overs or at least to slow down the tip so your child lands on the ground a bit more gently. There are no brakes, so the child can ""coast"" while the parent pushes. That means there is NO WAY for the child to slow down or stop quickly with their feet on the pedals. After several uses, the gearing between the frame and push handle began to strip, so I can no longer control the steering from the handle. The only plus is that my son is no longer interested in it, so I no longer have to deal with this unsafe, loud, broken trike!"
0,"Felicito a Ednita por la gran calidad de sus dos CD's Acusticos. Tengo ambos y los considero de lo mejor de conciertos acusticos grabados hasta el momento. Lo que si no me parece que es promocionen este DVD como el mismo concierto si NO lo es.El concierto grabado en este DVD corresponde a un masivo que realizo Ednita como promocion de los CD's Acusticos, que segun sus propias palabras, no esperaba el exito obtenido. Esta situacion resulta en un engaÃ±o a sus seguidores, ya que compramos algo que no era, incluso la portada del DVD no corresponde al concierto que contiene, sino al grabado en los CD's. Me hubiera gustado que se vendiera en DVD la misma sesion de grabacion de los CD's, y no otra cosa, que si bien, es tambien de calidad, no se iguala con la altamente alcanzada en los CD's.

0,I have three of her books and find the best one to be the backyard book and this one is good for the teaching and to get kids into of the cooking but some of them are a little hard for some if you don't bring all that you need to cook and she does repeet her shelf like she is looking for ideas or new food. In all I say its not bad for getting a dead line done.
0,"I used my unit three times, and after that it started having a clicking sound in the left speaker. Changing batteries proved futile. It was only five months old, yet it was already out of warranty (just 90 days). The ""customer service"" center stringed me along with a variety of operators and excuses, and finally said it couldn't provide service or support. Basically, I was left out in the cold. Buyer beware."
0,"Product works well, however customer service has een VERY POOR. Headset slider slips out of track. Unusable. Have been unsuccessful in trying since 1/12/07 to return/exchange product. Company does not respond. Amazon does not respond. Lesson learned. I'm stuck with this inferior product but will NEVER purchase electonics on-line. Learn from my mistake."
0,"i have tried two of these batteries but they work two days each, and after that it stopped."
0,I was disappointed in A Monk Swimming as I was hoping for more of a continuation of Angela's Ashes. Malachy McCourt is not the writer his brother is and seems to have spent most of his life in a drunken haze. Some may find this amusing but I don't and I'm NOT a tea totaller!
0,"I am a huge fan of surrealism, but these three movies pale in comparison to to some of the work of Arrabal's contemporaries. The images are interesting (at times), but the plots are boring and filled with pseudo-political massages and personal frustrations from what seem likes millenia ago. These 3 movies haven't aged well. I was disappointed by this set."
0,I bought this deck to replace my old Sony deck that died after 17 years. The Onkyo TA-RW255 I have is barely beyond the warranty period of 1 year and it is already showing problems. Tape Deck A does not work any more. I can still use Deck B to play. With this kind of quality I am not buying another Onkyo product any time soon.
0,"This deck was purchased for a general music classroom. It did not work out of the box but unfortunately was past the 30 day period when it was tested out. One would not expect a basic tape deck to not be able to play or record cassettes, but it appears to be a fairly common problem with a sensor in the unit. We are now trying to deal with a service center in another state and are out money for shipping on a brand new unit. Poor experience with Onkyo."
0,I was disappointed in this book. It flies way below the level of serious Six Sigma training. I would definitely not recommend using this book for other than the most basic venture into the world of Six Sigma - awareness not application. Using it with budding Six Sigma practitioners would be a major mistake.
0,"As a former teacher in the public and Christian schools, and as a former Sunday School teacher, I felt this book was outdated. Had I noticed that its copyright date was 1972, I would NEVER have ordered it. I'm glad it was cheap, but wish I'd saved the amount paid for book and postage to put on one I could read before buying."
0,I picked up a copy of this book and was very disappointed in the editing of it. Many words are misspelled and several of the captions are in a different language (Italian??)What could have been a very resourceful guide to astronomy is instead a mess of typos.
0,"I too was deceived by this book. The photos are of excellent quality and quite beautiful but the book is completely useless if you want to learn anything about astronomy. As others have stated, it is difficult to read due to the italian translation but more importantly, there are factual errors in this book. So if you are in it for the pictures, go for it. But if you are looking for correct and valid information, move on."
0,"I picked this up recently at a local metal store in the mall thinking well its Death Metal from Sweden so it has to be good,right? I was proven terribly wrong these guys try to copy In Flames down to the exact riff and the vocalist flat out [is bad],with lack of emotion or power. The drumming is decent but very repetitious to say the less. I would suggest other Swedish bands like (Arch Enemy, Naglfar,OLD In Flames)and other bands,anything but Divine Souls(a poor In Flames clone)to say the least."
0,"First off, if you wonder in what language that song is sang that sounds like redemption song? Douala!!!! Yes that is the language and little by little and bit by bit and indeed little bit by little bit, this central african language from Cameroon, first appeared in Michael Jackson's Thriller in the 80's. It is elbowing its way thru the boulevards of modern jazz , with pioneers like Richard Bona, the African Bazz jazz erudite.Well, this album is well crafted , in every aspect.Yes true Bob purists mAy find that this album lacks that ginger taste from Kingston!!

0,"I got it and it just seems odd. I like the idea of magnets but they are right on the ball of my ankle, not anywhere else. It doesn't fit very well. I wear a size 10.5 shoe and the brace is big. Doesn't close tightly enough and it covers your entire heal which to me feels funny in a shoe. Plus $7.50 for shipping. I'll look elsewhere next time."
0,"I, too, like one of the other reviewers, had trouble with the S-video connects: both were bad. Took it back for another, and this one was defective, also.Another example of gettigng what you pay for. There's a good reason that the next cheapest (name brand) recorder is $150 more..."
0,"I cannot believe this hack (Dietz) wrote a novel that precisely mirrors the game. I guess if M$ dangles enough money in front of a writer and says ""put this one dimentional story into a novel format"" any writer would do it. I was 60 pages into the book and hoping that Dietz would figure out a way to put in SOMEthing that would make this book interesting. But 60 pages of mind numbing was my ""puke point"" and I gave up. This book was so bad it was the first time I ever considered sending a book back to Amazon and demanding a refund. Unfortunately I spilled wine all over it.Add a 1/2 a star, I guess, if you never played the game.Skip this one and go straight to the Nylund book in the series. You won't miss anything important in this one."
0,"Ordering a new one because, like the other reviewer, my pot fell in the sink and the plastic lip shattered. Cheap in construction but not in price."

0,"I had a hard time assigning a ""rating"" this book. On one hand it does raise some interesting issues, but on the other, most of the issues are somewhat obvious IF you have an understanding of networks. If you have a technical background and know what a bit is, don't bother with this book.The author is really hung up on the word ""bit"" to the point that I found myself shouting ""ok, shut up, I understand"" as I read the book.I have difficulty recommending this book to the technically challenged as well. It won't explain how a network works. It will not explain the Internet. In fact it doesn't explain much of anything, except.... it DOES do a good job explaining the various modes of tranmitting bits and the limitations. It was because of this I gave it 2 stars.The book does seem dated. Many of the technologies he talks about are already in the PointCast software."
0,"I bought this book thinking that it would be very informative to set up my daughter for high school. It didn't help and it's such a boring read, that i doubt anyone will have the patience to read it! Dont Buy please!"
0,"This book has some helpful hints for helping students to be better organized, but the book itself is poorly organized. It didn't need to be nearly so long. It seemed as if the author felt the need to justify writing the book by fluffing the first chapters with fillers. I was constantly thinking ""just get to the point already"". Also, some of the comments about going to your child's school to help clean out lockers is just not realistic. Likewise, the recommendations to wait until your child is ready to cooperate are not really helpful. As a teacher, the demands on students today to get organized and stay on track and up-do-date are overwhelming.Connecting with your child's teacher and forming a partnership is the best way to communicate to the student that we are all in this together, and there really are few alternatives to ""getting it together"". Patience and gentle but firm prodding are the order of the day most days."
0,"Robbie Williams indeed has a huge ego. Considering his serious lack of musical talent it is difficult to know why he thinks his mediocre trash is indispensable listening for us all. The point is, who needs this filling the charts when there is so much genuine talent out there that needs some airplay. The production on this isn't bad, songs like 'Angels' are decent... but most is UNentertaining drivel. Please refrain from buying this record and getting him the superstardom in America that he is craving."
0,"Valor and vengeance is kill and his voice/growl dominates. This cd is way over-produced and it is awful. Go spend your money on something good like Despised Icon ""the ills of modern man"" or just go get some old Sheer Terror. No cartwheeling allowed dorks."
0,"This is a very peculiar book. Schwartz takes a particular form of Islam--Sufism--which is certainly not the mainstream of the religion, and tries to use it as the yardstick by which to measure any other form of Islam. The result, as with most ventures in using the wrong tools, is a poor book.Schwartz actually tells the reader very little about Islam, even his favored interpretation. Instead, he rants about how a strict traditionalist form of the religion must be the heresy. He makes it very clear that he doesn't like Saudis. Perhaps that's why he's never visited the country?But if you don't actually know your enemy, then how do you critize him honestly? Schwartz hasn't figured that part out.The book is worthless."
0,"1. The product is falsely described: ""bright felt mat with special non-skid backing"": it does not have a non-skid backing and is very slippery.2. The product came folded, in a box, with very sharp creases so it would not lie flat on a table without ironing.3. The product is grossly overpriced: buy a piece of felt at a fabric store for a fraction of the price and cut it to the size you prefer.Ravensburger Stow & Go - Puzzle Accessories"
0,"DO NOT BY THIS! My disappointment with this cd package is profound. I previously owned a single CD copy of ""5000 spirits"", which I unfortunately left on a train, so here was trying to replace it and pick up an extra disc (the self-titled ""incredible string band"") as a bonus. Unfortunately, although ""5000 spirits"" is a fantastic album, something has gone terribly wrong with the remastering (re-wrangling?) here. The tracks are smothered in this horrible, unrelenting delay effect, which was not on my previous, unremasterd, copy - if it is intentional then those responsible have no taste, if unintentional then the channels have been sloppily mixed. All copies of this should be withdrawn from sale. Buy ""5000 spirits"", it is the Incredible String Band's most whimsical, most inventive. But AVOID this so-called remastered version."
0,"It seemed like they published this book on the cheap! Most of the pictures were hand shetches, and it took forever for the author to make a simple point. I think he just wanted to fill up some additional pages."
0,"Beaytiful scenery, but an utterly boring story.Perhaps it came off better in the original IMAX, but I doubt it."
0,"This book is extremely out-of-date and cheesy in its depiction of Bad Guys Who Smoke. The only reason I read it to my son was because it was assigned by the school (who'd gotten free copies from the state. I can see why they were free). I would urge people NOT to bother buying this book. Of course kids shouldn't smoke, but I think this book will backfire with its corny lingo that was fit for another era. Smoking stinks, but let's find a more up-to-date way to tell our kids."
0,After reading the material on the Liquid Fence Mole Repellent I thought I had finally found something that would rid my flower beds of moles. I have been battling moles for years and tried just about every thing including traps. I actually used about three times more of this product than the instructions suggested. It appeared the moles left for about a week but they have returned again. I sprayed the area again and the moles didn't even leave that time that I could tell. They were still making tunnels. I give up!
0,"Bought this last year, not work at all. No matter how much you put there, the mole still come and go without issue. My lawn did not survive the winter after apply this product. The mole still so active on my lawn during snow time."
0,"I purchased these speaker stands from Best Buy based upon a recommendation from a worker there. Because these stands were one of the more expensive sets at Best Buy, I thought they'd be fairly decent. However, they are ABSOLUTE garbage... the upper portions were not of matching diameter and did not install properly into the bases. I ended up cracking the plastic adjustment ""bolt"" on one stand. The one stand that was not ""defective"" would not stay at the proper height and the speaker would rotate too easily. The screws stripped the plastic pieces. The base is too light... it would take very little to knock the speaker stands over even without a speaker installed. Overall, because of the price and picture on the box, I thought these speaker stands would be a good buy; however, they turned out to be very flimsy and defective. Even if one of the stands was not defective, I still would not recommend them. I am no longer using these stands. Don't waste your money."
0,"Don't read this book if you are seriously interested in the religious issues of the first Christians and how they might differ from what the historical Jesus taught. The book fails to convey the seriousness of those amazing times and dwells on superficialities of how Paul looked and got beat up, that kind of thing. What could be religious ferver and meaning has been replaced by sentimentalism. Your eyes will not go popping out of your head at this one. --Strephon Kaplan-Williams"
0,"We adore the large Automoblox, but hate to spend so much, so the minis seemed like a perfect compromise. However, the wheels just simply aren't as durable as the large cars. I think we have 1 wheel out of the 7 mini cars we have that still has its original tire covering. Disappointing. =( However, my daughter loves to put the tires together to make limos. =)"
0,"This is an entertaining look at the Lakers historic title run in 1972; however, it is filled with errors of fact (Neal walk a rookie in 1961?) and spelling (Dave Debusschere is a Hall of Famer - spell his name correctly)! There are more examples, and they're pretty disctracting - it's tough to see that a major publisher wouldn't do a better editorial job."
0,"I bought this stand hoping for a simple, inexpensive means of using my laptop with better ergonomics and airflow around my Dell. After 2 weeks one hinge broke from simply assembling. Amazon quickly replaced.Second one broke after about 4 months. Again the hinges with minimal use.This is not even worth $20."
0,"I am dissapointed with this product. You just have two position to raise the hinged support. The fit between my new ThinkPad T61 and the support is loosy. It keeps moving because the product has just an small rubber framework to act as a resistant to slide. Additionally I am not pretty sure the air flow is improved. The name ""portable notebook coooling stan"" is too much."

0,This is your typical textbook. It is boring and will put you to sleep. Why do all college textbooks have to be so darn boring. I guess it may be the subjects?
0,"Firstly, I'll give the product its props and convey that it is definitely a handsome bag. Its design is terrific as well. So, if you want to sit at home and admire it, you're all set. In contrast, my travels called for the item to actually be used. Set off on an extended trip with this item in tow and it lasted less than 60 days before the leather hanging strap on the end snapped at the rivet and the stitching on one of the two zippers came undone. As a result, I had to wrap a bungee cord around it to keep everything from falling out and really didn't use the zippers anymore because it was easier to reach straight in through the eight inch gap in the side."

0,"This is not Cotton; the tag says: ""Contents: Polyester Fibers"". We try to buy only natural content items for our dog, so this won't do. Also, at 4.5"" and 1.5 lbs, it's quite heavy, hard, and large - even for our 70 lb flat-coated retriever. It could even potentially injure your pet if thrown a bit fast and/or in the wrong direction. Otherwise, seems well constructed though."

0,My Granddaughter is so in love with my Little Pony things now. We have most of them and most accessories but this is definetly top heavy. This is the 1st item I've been very disappointed with. I'd read that the Ferris Wheel can't hold 3 poinies but it can't even hold 2. The set-up keeps coming apart . What a Disappointment! So much of the other things that are Pony related are vey cute.
0,What a piece of crap! Will not stay together after being assembled CORRECTLY! My twin daughters have probably only played with this 2 or 3 times because the pieces start coming apart anytime they are touched. I certainly hope the company that made this toy sees some of these reviews and makes improvements.
0,"The Amusement Park Playset does not want to hold together. In fact it does not even go together properly. We have the Butterfly Island Playset and it is wonderful. I wish it could have been made as well. Oh well, I did get the Amusement Park at a clearance price."
0,Odyssey Through O2 is a remix project of Jarre's album Oxygene 7-13 and is mix of electronic music and trance. The problem is that the original tracks are so amazing that tinkering with them leads to a result that is often less then stellar. Many of these so called DJs I have never even heard of. Being a famous artist like Jarre could he not have asked people like Shep Pettibone or Oakenfold instead of these hacks. The booklet contains liner-notes written by the DJ's. Allmusic gave this release 2.5/5. I give it a weak 2. 2/5.

0,"I just bought the 24-muffin version on this pan because it boasted ""superior non-stick""...even paid a couple dollars more than a similar competing brand for that feature. While it looks nice and feels sturdy, it was a big disappointment when I baked a batch of muffins and they stuck so badly to the pan that it ruined the entire batch. Not one muffin out of the 24 came out intact, even when I very carefully tried to separate them from the sides after I saw that the first couple were ruined. I have made this recipe before, and they came out like usual and tasted great, so I am assuming it was the pan, but hopefully other users will have more luck than I did."
0,"There is no doubt that this book had a lot of time, effort, and creativity spent on it, however a good deal of the information in the book is wrong.It may be delivered in a ""cool and interesting"" format, however it doesn't matter how grand you build the castle, if you build it on sand. There is so much information in the book that has been proved incorrect. I finally stopped flipping through the book when I read where it says coconut oil is bad for you and will clog your arteries, etc. Coconut oil is good for your body and arteries!So anyway... if the artist who cartooned the book teamed up with a disciplined and accurate scientist I think we would have something quite valuable.. but until then... you may be filling your mind with easily digestible, but bad, information.Time to return the book. Best of luck next time."

0,"This movie shows Allen, of whom I've been a huge fan for many years, not as a tortured sole, but as a spoiled child. Artist's supposedly need chaos and disharmony for inspiration, but flying around in your own jetplane while your band is in a bus, and then later feeling guilted by this does not equate to the stuff art/comedy/drama is made of...this film highlights Allen's selfishness, and his companion/wife is a bore...posing as some fraction of a pseudo-intellectual, saying nothing challenging to the well-read 62 year old child...its hard to believe this is his muse. Yet, he did have the guts to let this ugly side of him be displayed (again) to the world...and there is something masochistically enteraining about watching this brilliant man sign his autograph for a fan as if this were annoying WORK yet put on the phony celebrity face to brush the fan off...perhaps a metaphor us all."
0,"Some interesting possibilities (gay, bipolar, tough guy, criminal- detective as lead, Brixton-centered plot, oddball crime boss) don't really gel into anything that interesting.

0,"I purchased this gate on a sale event and tried to put it in my kitchen. However, this gate is absolutely not sturdy and easy to fall even with a light push. It can't lock very well because the adjustable feature is poorly designed where you can only adjust to ""certain"" position but not ""all."" I tried to fit it around the stairs and it doesn't work. Simply speaking, it doesn't work in any entrance of my house. I returned the item the next day. Please consider another gate if you are looking for a secure one."
0,"I am a novice audiophile but I can tell these speakers leave a lot to be desired. My $40 radio shack speakers blow this thing away. The only difference between the Center channel and the towers is the mounting system and the orientation of the label on the grill. These are definitely not rated at RMS rating that they say that they are. I have mine hooked up to an onkyo 120 watt RMS reciever and they begin to pop and distort at about 1/3 volume. The Center and towers look pretty, but they don't perform like they should. If you want a better deal people are selling them on ebay for around 50 bucks, but I can't even say they are worth that. These didn't even come with the base that is shown in the picture. If you could get these for less than $20 then I would say go for it. If you paid over $100 I'm sorry for your loss."
0,"I am sure I would love the movie, IF I could actually watch it. Even though the DVD is labeled for ALL REGIONS, it will not play in my DVD player. It should not be labeled that way if it is not going to play in all DVD players in all countries.Very disappointed!"
0,"The one bad apple in The Criterion Collection Blu-ray releases. There is hardly any difference between the blu-ray edition and the SD DVD edition. All the special features in the SD DVD you get in the blu-ray in a digipak (a really crappy one at that), however, you do not get the extended edition of the movie that came in the SD DVD. The one saving grace is that on amazon the Blu-ray is cheaper that SD DVD. I recommend that you pay a few dollars more for the SD edition which comes in a really nice digipak and a better booklet thats on the blu-ray.The news is that the transfer was approved by the cinematographer - what was he thinking?!?! Despite the crappy blu-ray transfer, the aspect-ratio is not what was in the original release.By the way, the movie is great and you will enjoy it"
0,"Too Bad... What a shabby dressing technically given to this 1987 first class world ranking film.If it was shot in 70 mm this means the resolution, sharpness and color should be as smashingas it was in the theater.

No NOT with all that rich camera workpossible. The audio is the original TWO CHANNEL stereo. This was a sweeper at the Oscars and International venture.

I emailed Amazon and told them I did not have time return it but that I was very disappointed that it was not what was pictured. My local Home Depot had the box I received in stock and cheaper than the Amazon price. I was assured that they would deal with the picture to keep future customers from falling into the same trap as I did. However, that has been several weeks ago and they still have the same picture on the website??? It is a reasonable price for the product I got but it was not what I ordered."

0,We adopted this book because several of our neighboring colleges use the text. After using the book I am stunned that any college continues to use it. Our department never had so many complaints from students. We almost always suffer through a text for the full 4-year adoption period. This text was so bad that we dropped it after one year.
0,"Having completed a two semester college introductory course in differential and integral Calculus based on M. Spivak's book, a browse through Stewart's Calculus left me with a somewhat sour taste of mouth. Practically no demonstrations of theorems; little reference to basic analysis, which some people consider THE most important difference between a great Calculus course and a run of the mill one. If anything, this is a good book on learning how to use the tools provided by Calculus, but without an adequate focus on the subject itself.I could have grudgingly given three stars, had it not been for the absurdly high price. Definitely not worth it."
0,"I suffered through 3 quarters of calc with stewart's last edition (3rd ed.) at OSU. This book will likely prove exceedingly difficult for the math averse, and is certainly a terror to read for even science/eng majors who have not seen the material before. Lucid it is not. The chapter on infinite series/sequences is terrible. If you are buying this book for a calc class I strongly suggest you buy the solutions manual; for several sections, including very important ones (eg integration by parts, trig substitution, chain rule, some series stuff), the explanation in the book was so obscure/incomplete that I actually learned the material by consulting the solutions manual. I have not used the study guide, and cannot comment on its usefulness."
0,"I bought this book mainly for a reference. Looking through it, it seems to be like most all upper level math books -not very user friendly!Why do these over-educated math nerds who write these books make them sooo hard to follow!?!?

0,"The book was good, and informative; however, it does not really reflect the position of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). The author is a big fan of raw food diets, colon cleansing and drastically cleansing diets and fasting. In TCM this treatment may be appropriate for some individuals suffering from ""Damp Stagnation"" such as cancer, obesity, etc, and maybe ""Damp Heat"" (i.e. inflamatory diseases) but IS NOT usually recommended for everyone, and NEVER recommended for anyone on a long term basis. The TCM maintenance diet prefers food that is lightly cooked, and avoidance of extreme food such as juices.I give the book a low rating because it's title implies that it is a book about Chinese health philosophy, when it is not."

It makes great sense and I'm curious if I wouldn't absolutely have loved it if I were still out West where water is scarce and a premium.However, water is not an issue here where it rains at least once a week, so the self watering is somewhat a moot (sp?) point and actually was 'the problem'.I ordered mine and set out on my deck. Two days later it rained and completely flooded the container, killing everything. Ok..so now what?With my sister's, her tomato plants grew large - but NO tomatoes!It was an expensive trial for both of us and left us completely unimpressed.Obviously, there's something I'm not understanding or doing right, but until then, anything I plant in the ground seems to do just fine."
0,This product is made from plastic! For some reason (terra cotta) I was expecting different.
0,"Everything in this book is circumstantial and would never be proven in a court of law. Some of it was interesting, but mostly OPINIONS expressed as facts. Take with many grains of salt."
0,"The movie is more about Christianity than surfing. I rated it low because it's somewhat manipulative. It starts with solid surfing from some young groms and a few subtle religious messages. Slowly it cuts the surfing and goes heavy on the religion. No problem with the message, but the movie isn't being marketed as what it really is."
0,"Product is very attractive; however, too small and flimsy for the price. Aditionally, item is too small compared to actual."
0,"I bought this for my preschooler, thinking that it would be a good backpack for him to take his supplies to class.Unfortunately, this product is more like a Lightning McQueen pillow with shoulder straps than something useful for carrying anything. The pocket for it is about 4 inches by five inches and has no depth at all --- think of a flat zippered money pouch.The shoulder straps are flat 1 inch pieces of nylon webbing and do not appear to be very sturdily attached.This would have been a fine product if the pocket was bigger and not so much stuffing put in it.As it is, I cannot recommend it as a backpack."
0,I am extremely disappointed.All figures come off when washing for the first time!This is really a phony item I've ever bought on Amazon!Extremely expectations!We hope that no one be fooled like me!
0,"This worked for about 10 minutes and then the power went off on all of the ""hot"" devices that were supposed to remain hot. Adjusted the sensitivity according to the directions and it still didn't work. Basically it's 1/2 of a generic power strip now. Very disappointing."
0,"they are bigger than they look, clumsy and my son does not no which things should be in the hot spot. if i can get feedback on that, i would like it"
0,"I tried this device.. i had high hopes. My main computer is a dell1720 laptop. I think it does not draw enough power, regulary, to make this device work. It had a habit of switch on and off.. quickly! I tried to adjust the power level, but to no avail. I was very afraid it was going to nuke all of my components by switching them on and off so quickly. Maybe if I had a regular desktop it would have worked out better. But who is buying those anymore?"
0,"I bought an LCG3 from Amazon just over a year ago. The stip worked great for some time, then suddenly stopped turning off switched devices. I tried many times adjusting the trimming knob, but it does not help. I've tried multiple times to contact BITS customer support, but get absolutely no response. Not even an acknowledgement of my email. There is no support phone number on the website, just an email form. The box says the strip has a 2-year warranty, but I have no idea how to get it replaced since customer support will not even respond. Very unhappy with this product."
0,"Back to the drawing board. The Smart Strip should be renamed the Dumb Strip. What a piece of junk. What a waste of time. All of the negative reviewers were right and I should have listened to them but no, I went ahead and bought this poorly made thing. Can't return this crummy power strip fast enough. And it's made in China. Buyer beware."
0,"I got one of these from my PPL guy after a home review. I tried plugging in a fan. Tried the green plugs, blue plugs and red plugs. I never could get the fan to come on. Plugged the fan directly into a socket and it worked fine.I guess the Smart Strip is smarter than me (or my wife). We could NEVER figure out how to get it to work."
0,"They try to save 2 cents and they did not put any edges on the buckle so the strap just slide. You have to use one hand to position the object and the other hand over the buckle to press on the handle so your strap wont slide!Amazon shipping ....a joke. Sent by Post Office and a 3 day shipment arrive 14 days later.I give 2 stars only because i was able to do the job for wich i had purchase it! Concept is good, engineering is good but the quest to save 2 cents .....just totally ruin it!"

0,The product does not work as advertise. My buddy and I was going to use it to move a bar upstairs. Everything seemed to work fine except the sleeve kept slipping. We just threw it out about halfway into the move. I recommend just renting a furniture dolly. That's what I ended up doing.
0,"The item was advertised as made in the USA, but when it came, it said made in China. We only buy American made products so we were very disappointed. Not sure what we're going to do with it."
0,"Quite Frankly, this new Holt Phyiscs book, does NOT cover all the content that is involved in the detailed study of Physics. Not only that, but it leaves out some of the most important principles that are in physics. For example, Chapter 5-2, we talk about Energy, it doesn't give the law of conservation of energy, which is one of the most important laws in physics. It also when talking about Newton's laws, doesn't use the ideas that Newton had. There are so many things missing, I could go on forever, I wish I could give this book a negative score, but I can't do so. I'm currently in Physics at my school, and I like to study Physics in my spare time. Serway is a very good author of the college books, that I have, but this one does not cut it for a full understanding of Physics."

0,"Wanted a vintage piece for my library, but the seller had it labeled ""like new"" just missing a dust jacket... what they didnt mention that the book had been so mistreated that the pages were falling out, I cant even open it with out segments flying out at me. When I requested a return address, I received no correspondence at all. Dont buy from this seller."
0,"I guess this combo does what it claims but at the level I'm at it was kinda cheap and cheesy. The rod tip is garbage, and the guides are cheap metal. The reel I already knew was not good so no surprise when that failed."
0,"This headset is terrible. The microphone portion constantly falls off of the earclip. The earclip is very uncomfortable on your ear. The microphone is so bad that no one can hear what you say. After trying to use this on a very important 6 hour teleconference, I ended up throwing it in the trash and just holding the phone to my ear. Don't buy this product."
0,"I tried this headset on several calls to friends, both with my cell phone and with my home phone. On every call, my friends complained that the sound was either horrible or painful. Nothing helped - talking softer or louder, moving the microphone boom - adjusting the volume - nothing. The sound on my end, the fit, and the comfort are all fair, but the abysmal quality of the H425's microphone makes the product worthless."
0,"The application is also accused of shortening the life span of the user's hard drive by performing a scan of system processes every 1.5 seconds.Another widely publicised feature of the technology is a rootkit that hides the digital rights management technology from the system and the user.The rootkit will actually hide any file, process or registry key that begins with the characters '$sys$', making it extremely easy for virus authors and hackers to hide malicious applications from virus and spyware scanners."
0,"I could never get the suction cups to stick onto the tub. I don't have a textured tub, but the sides are curved at the ends. If you have straight-sided tubs this might work better. Whether the tub wall was wet or dry, they never stuck.When I did try to give my daughter a bath, the liner rose with the water level because the suction cups wouldn't stick. If you only use an inch or two of water in tub, then this product is for you. I returned it a week later."
0,"Don't waste your time with this product. The design in inherently flawed. The buoyancy provided by the water in the tub provides enough force to overcome the suction cups. In addition if your toddler decides to grab it, it may give way and cause your toddler to slip and potentially hit thier head. Amazon should remove this product from their website!"
0,"I did not like this book. It started out really good, and I was interested to find out more about this character. Then it turned into a lesbian love affair between two women, each claiming to be straight. This has a very graphic sex scene in it. And it had no ending, no foreshadowing to what happens to Alice. It seemed almost like the author wrote the first half of the book, and then had someone else write the second half. Would not suggest buying it."
0,"My usual recipe for Chicken Wings which are highly raved about by all friends were not good when using this as a deep fryer. My FryDaddy does a much better job, and I could buy 3 of those for the same price as this thing. Would not recommend this product. Did Return Product to Amazon!"
0,"I bought this fryer and used it twice. The 3rd time I got the error message on the screen and could not get it to work, even hitting the reset button wouldn't get it going. I had to take it to an authorized dealer for repair and he got it working. I used it one more time and it went out again. I took it back and two months later I received a new fryer in the mail. The new one doesn't have the digital controls, it's back to the old fashion dial for temperature setting. If you look on their web site this fryer is no longer there. The one that they sent me is there instead of the Dual Zone. When the fryer worked, it did a great job, however it didn't work very long. I will be using my new one tonight to fry some fish and french fries. My guess is that it will work as it should, since they got rid of that stupid Dual Zone control."
0,"Im very pissed that I wasted my money on this, from what I read in the description it seemed to imply that this is a how to book but soon as I got it in the mail to no suprise it was just a bunch of stories, I feel imbarrised that even for a second i thought this might be real and is the only reason I don't demand my money back, unless they remove the part of the title on HOW TO GUIDE I feel it should be removed from all sites and for the remaining books to be tossed into a fire.. BEcause of this stupid book I wasted i don't know how many days waiting for it when I could of been doing something more productive which would be anything other than reading this book AGAIN ill say they should not call it a how to book on how to teleport when thats not at all what it is, and im not the kind of person who usually posts reviews Bad or Good, but this pissed me off so much that I had to be one of those people who write these mean reviews"

0,"I love cardio dance as a workout but don't have the time or opportunity to take real classes in a gym or studio, so I thought this dvd would be a good enough replacement. Unfortunately I hated it. This may just be personal preference but I thought the music was bad, the choreography was boring and Jamie's constant chatter annoying. The back-up dancers tend to look less than enthused and are often out-of-time with Jamie.The moves are demonstrated very quickly and are hard to grasp the first time, but I'm never out-of-breath by the end of it. I put everything I have into the moves but they just don't work the muscles or get my heart rate up. I've done the workout about 10 times now, enough to convince myself it was worth the $15, although I've never made it to the end of the dvd--even with the sound muted--I always get too annoyed and just go run.If you're in any kind of physical shape, this movie will probably not be a challenge for you and would just be a waste of time and money."
0,"Altough Dr Frazier is an icon on RTW travel, this book is nothing special. It is very useful if you have a old R80 G/S, since it gives the reader a lot of detail of the technical improvements you should do to the bike in order to make it sort of reliable. The pictures are the lowest quality possible and the book is really expensive for what it is. If you don't have a R80 buy his other book, Riding the World with good quality pictures and great literature. A must for the dual sport rider along with Adventure Motorcycling Handbook. These two books led me to buy a KLR 650 instead of my past dream machine BMW R1200 GSA. It is nice but not as realiable as a cheap japanese machine (plus saved me $ 15 grand). Just like a Toyota and a Land Rover. The other seems to be the best but it is just pure advertising. Hope this helps. Good luck. JP"
0,"I purchased this farm for my son who is just under a year old. He loved to play with the one at his grandma's house (an older version purchased at a garage sale a few years back) so I thought I would buy one for our house, too. When I took it out of the box, the silo section was not connected. I connected it without too much trouble but then opened the farm and the silo fell off. It continues to fall off all of the time! I have given up trying to keep the pieces together - it is a waste of my time. The farm animals now share stalls in the barn -making it a bit harder to make the animal sounds. It appears that the toy has been ""remodeled"" to be less expensive to make. The plastic is thinner, the quality poorer, and the spaces/stalls for the animals smaller and more complicated. It is still darn cute and my son likes to play with it -it just is not the same quality it used to be."
0,"I am very disappointed in Fisher Price, Amazon.com and myself....I happened to get 'mail' from Healthytoys.com and found that the adorable little Fisher Price Animal Farm set that my little grandson Leo would love has unacceptable levels of chlorine...which affects reproductive systems and may cause asthma...Mama Mia...of course, I'll be sending it back to Amazon.com and will hurry to find something else for Leo. I am upset and angry at Fisher Price for still selling 'bad' toys...haven't they gotten the message to clean up their act yet, I'm upset and angry at Amazon for being an outlet for these toys and, of course, upset with myself for not being diligent enough in researching my shopping. But, there is a silver lining, I found out about all of this before Chistmas...before Leo got to see the cute little farm set and love it. Bah Humbug!"
0,"I purchased the item for my great grandson for Christmas. He was delighted with it EXCEPT that the sound part does not work. His Dad did all he could to make it work, but couldn't.By the time he realized that, the box had been put in the dumpster and trash had been collected.This is the first time I have ever received a defective item from your company."
0,"I loved the first one soo much and loved this second one as well to up until a point, but in the end, I ended up hating this whole series with a fiery passion. Read at your own caution. It's a good book, but...well, read at your own caution."
0,"If ever a book was in need of an editor, this one was it. I enjoyed the first five books, ""The Blending"" although they progressively were more stilted and difficult to follow. There is a great story and series in here fighting to get out! Even simple things like chapter headings that listed the location of the scene and a map of the ""world"" would have helped. I start to wonder if the pressure on the authors of these types of series to get the next one out fast is overwhelming and doesn't give them time to re-read their own work before they send it off. I was fantasizing about grabbing a pen and editing it myself and then sending it back to the publisher! What a disappointment."
0,I was disappointed when I received this book since I thought it was going to be a guide to writing policies and procedures. This book is a guide to financial statement preparation.
0,"This machine is wonderful when it works. Within a month of having it we started getting the ""Ground too Fine"" message. We would go through the steps to correct it only to have it work for a cup or two and then it would come back. We contacted DeLonghi (a chore in itself) and were sent a repair pack to send the unit in. It came back and worked great for about a month and then started acting up again. We contacted DeLonghi again (it only took a week this time) and have another repair pack on the way, hopefully this time something will get fixed."
0,"If you like topless females jumping around, this collection rates a 5 star. The film makers really need to go to school or watch other films and see how to plot and write a action film using very pretty females to keep interest going. I can only say I am glad I didn't pay full price. I am a big fan of japanese movies, I have been buying Asian films for almost 40 years."
0,"So many people told me how much they loved these books and I usually enjoy the Loyola Classics the book is a part of. But I found the characters flat, the dialogue wooden and the plot plain dull. I got half way through and decided that was enough."
0,"I was under the impression that this book was going to teach me something about exotic dancing. (I'm new to this line of work). It doesn't teach a dancer anything she doesn't already know, however I think it does help out the average woman enhance her romantic life by describing some exotic moves. Pampering and caring for our bodies is something all women know how to do, but reading the book serves as a reminder for us to take time out and go that extra step. I didn't care much for the checklists, interview lists, or the certificate at the end, but that's just my opinion. Overall the book was worth reading."
0,"I really like Warners bras, of which I have 4, the best I've worn, very comfortable. This one is very nice, very soft fabric and beautiful design. But the cup fabric is thin and the shape of the nipples can be perceived through it. I had to return it."
0,"this book seems like a reminder notes made by the authors for themselves. i don't think anyone else may understand what is written here. check attaway's matlab textbook if you really want to learn. don't get deceived, the positive reviews were paid by the authors/editorial, this is a real review from a real user (this and all the negative ones). so again, stay away from this book, the content is as dull as the cover or more, worst matlab textbook ever."

Now, my computer's built in sd card reader doesn't even recognize it! Now none of my devices (digital camera, PDA, laptop, ...) will recognize it. I contacted their tech support for an exchange (I got it just over a month ago), and heard nothing back. Guess their 5 year warrenty is just a gimmick. I do not recomment ever buying anything from ACP-EP, not dependable (horrible product), and absolutly no service."

The plot isn't compelling, the cycling isn't to be found, and the characters aren't engaging. Did I really read the same book as the other reviewers?"
0,This heater worked quite well for 3 months. Than it began leaking oil. DeLonghi instructed us to take it to a repair center a half an hour away. The repair center was not helpful and DeLonghi customer service was quite rude. At this point I am giving up on the notion that they will fix or replace this unit and will buy a new space heater. I will not purchase this brand again.
0,"This heater is a great heater, it works nice, quite and heats up the room fairly quickly even on setting level 1. However, I am really disappointed with the quality Delonghi is producing. All the side panels are crooked, none are in their place properly, this is the second one I received and its in bad shape, the first one was even worse. Lately all Delonghi products are falling off the quality benchmark. A couple of weeks ago I bought a Delonghi coffee maker, paid about $100, and the thing does not stand properly (legs are not even.) The same with my Delonghi Griddle, there is a gap on the face plate joint! They should not allow any such products to leave their factories in my opinion for the price they are selling!"
0,I purchased this heater to take the chill off a small kitchen in an old drafty house. I called the company to be sure I was using it right as this is my first heater like this. I am told this is as good as it gets and that is not very good. It is warm in about a two foot radius around the heater and cold in the rest of the room. It is not really cold outside yet so by the time it is this heater will be totally useless.
0,Upon arrival the heater was leaking badly. I didn't notice until I pulled the heater out of the box & it made quite a mess. The box is saturated so returning it will be a joy. Probably an isolated incident but I'm going to try a different brand anyway.
0,"As far as recieveing this product and quility, 5 stars! But, if you are a real chopped and screw listner, this is HORRIBLE! 007 should not ever chopp and screw anything! I should have known better when I heard how he SLOPPED and chopped up UGK greatest hits!"

0,"I've heard this CD, and unfortunately I'm confused of this music. Kitaro tries to play as Dean Evenson but much worse. There is non-melodical music. It is partially glued with samples, without ""think"" and timing. Maybe two of compositions are better, but it is to little to say, that Kitaro made good CD."
0,The previous comment is not true. I just bought this wheel. It is dished for a 7-speed cassette (hence 7s) not a single speed or fixed gear. I also received it poorly packed for shipment and beat up with a hole in the side.
0,"It would be really nice if kd would return to the style of ""Crying"" or ""Constant Craving"". In a word, this recording is ""boring"". It is a shame to have such a powerful voice and not use it to her maximum ability. Sounds like she was bored throughout the entire process. Kick it, kd."
0,I was very disappointed with this album. k.d.'s voice has a very shallow quality and the music sounds like a bunch of canned cliches. Each song is nondescript. The production is 3rd rate - everything sounds like it was recorded in a box. I can't listen to this! Zero stars.
0,"First I'll state that I think kd lang is one of the most gifted song stylists of our time. Her live concert performances (which I have seen in Canada and the U.S.) are great musical events; charming, witty, electrically charged and lots of fun. Some of her earlier cds have been brilliant. However, I feel her musical choices in the last few years have lacked imagination and do not sufficiently stretch her as an artist or make us sit up and ACTIVELY listen. She seems to have lost her edge. It's becoming easy listening. Challenge me kd, as you have in the past! Her thrilling talent is much larger than her current material. I appreciate her mission to sing new music but until she finds better material I'd be thankful for a cd of standards from her...to be able to enjoy the full range of her voice and supreme artistry."
0,"Tried the DMSO as some people had said how well it did their joints. Used it for a number of days and I could not tell any difference in my joints. Some things just don't work for everyone and this did not work for me, so from my experience I could not recommend this to others."
0,"I don't know about everyone else, but when I put the cd in my computer and went to install the program, not only did the dumb program not realize that I was running above 256 colors (which is what it requires to run), but the program file was infected with W95/CIH.dr, which, on the 26th of any given month, writes over your BIOS, rendering your computer useless, and write over your hard drive as well. Sometimes this is called the Chernoble virus because it often occurs on April 26th...good luck running the cd. I am sure the book is good, but the cd makes it a one star"
0,"I want something like ""All the Pretty Horses"".Tried looking for something & that is the reasonI picked this one."
0,"Don't get me wrong the songs on the CD deserve 5 stars, but what about the CD itself? I bought mine from US sealed with the security on top of the case and guess what? the CD is not silver, it's a CD-R!! The barcode on the spine of the insert is RMED00211. This is outrageous! Renaissance Records should correct this mistake."
0,"I bought this when my old sunbeam iron died. I had god luck with my old Sunbeam, but this one is just awful! I've only had it a month and it is already spitting, dripping and leaking water.

0,"This is among the worst books that I have read.I found this book juvenile and annoying. This story seems to be the author's private fantasy, and (in my opinion) should never have been published. Everything revolves around Del. Del is blond, beautiful, tough (but sensitive on the inside), able to kick ass in a fight, and is always right because the story is designed around making her look good, and feeding Roberson's vicarious vanity.This book is neither original nor skillfully written, and I would not recommend it under any circumstances."
0,"Although the writer of this book was a teacher she writes less than a page about her experience in that field. Mary Carey is by her own account a journalist. The style of the book is not to my taste. It is choppy and lacks a definitive story line or cohesive theme other than her life and all of the ""famous"" people she knows, herself included.I do not like to read ""endquote"" when the punctuation has clearly conveyed that idea. Pet peeve perhaps but even still the book is not likely to be of interest to the current casual reader.The title of this book piqued my interest, unfortunately it was all downhill from there. If you plan to live in Talkeetna and want to know the history of the era you may find this book useful. Otherwise read it only if you plan to teach in Talkeetna and want to know some early history of the school there or you have an undying curiosity about the author, Mary Carry, as it reads like a bad self-centered gossip column."
0,"I have been a researcher since the beginning, I have hundreds of books including the 27 volume of the Warren Report. This book offers nothing that is not available through other books. Total waste of time."
0,"This book is somewhat interesting as a story, has virtually no documented sources whatsoever. There is no bibliography, no works cited, not even footnotes. The closest we get is an occasional quotation from a primary source with a rough citation above or below it. This makes it virtually useless as any sort of serious academic study."
0,"I used this potty for about a month with no problems at all. Last night the potty caved in and my 21 month old daughter fell in the toilet! I would not recommend this product to anyone. She is only 26 pounds and she fell in, what would happen to a larger child? This potty does not come with any warning regarding elongated toilets, since it does not fit on them, you should be careful using it on one."
0,"I was hoping for something lightweight and easy to carry for potty training purposes. I definitely got what I asked for, but I didn't ask to get my daughter's butt cheeks to get pinched in the process! Aside from this seat being flimsy, the package was missing the ""travel bag"" it was supposed to come with. Needless to say, I returned it and got the padded travel potty seat instead. It's a little bulkier to have to lug around, but my little girl is so much more comfortable!"
0,"Once again Troy Denning shows us that he can take a great campaign setting and utterly destroy it. ... the first half was great, a very good adventrue type novel. Then he gets trapped in the mazes which turns into some symbolic crap about pain and suffering. When I want symbolism i'll read a great classic, but I didn't want symbolism I just wanted a good fantasy book, which in this case did not deliver.Also, Denning still does not know how to write something in the first person point of view. At times it seems like the book is simply narriated, but then it turns into the Lady of Pains specific observances as to what is going on around the hero. The same thing was attempted with Crucible: Trail of Cyric the Mad and failed just like this book."
0,"We got a new manager in our office, who apparently did not read the entire book. So now every morning management walks around the office to ensure we are working. If we are talking it has to be work related. There are no questions of concern or interest in our lives. Just the ""are you really working?"" approach. I read an excerpt of this book and got the point. How could someone with more education not get it? Unless you want management to be on you constantly - DO NOT recommend this book. I guess the old saying is true - ""A little knowledge is a dangerous thing."""

How can you take such a hallowed and historically well-documented event like the Masters and trivialize it with galling inaccuracies and even worse story line.

I was better off with a copper wire in the tv.It's poor design and plastic parts made it fall apart after moving it around trying to get reception.I replaced it with a set of rabbit ears at a garage sale for $.25. That was the best antenna purchase I have ever made. Digital signal does not require you to have anything special, older plain antennas do best.2 stars because it was better than nothing....eh, debatable."
0,"I just got this Philips PHDTV3 antenna. Based on the comments I've seen posted before I knew there was a chance for error, but I thought I'd be on the lucky side. The antenna did nothing better for me than the current rabbit no-power required cheap 1-dollar antenna I had before. I still need to play a little bit with it before I declare it a disaster, so if someone experienced the same and had solved appreciate any suggestion."
0,"The first one i had was broken. So Amazon replaced it, quick. Thanks! Anyhow... It doesn't take a genius to figure out how to plug it in, but they could have given SOME instructions. What does the little knob do? Anything? I can't tell any difference. How should I point the antenna for best reception? People and objects moving about the house can affect the reception, channels come an go sometimes for no reason. I can get the same quality picture just by hooking up a long coax..."
0,"I found this video to be too long without much payback in terms of relaxation. I also thought that some of the exercises were inappropriate for the early postnatal period but that Colette neglected to point all of them out. Some are noted, but occasionally not until after the pose is shown, so some people might be tempted to do too much too soon. I also didn't care much for the production quality. I guess I'm just used to the Living Arts videos. I would also have preferred to see more babies in the video, as one of the reasons I bought it was to find a way to exercise while my son was awake. Since he never napped for more than 10 minutes at a time and needed constant holding, I was disappointed to find no poses modified so that you could use your infant as part of the pose.Prenatally I did the Yoga Mama video and Shiva Rea's video, both of which I truly enjoyed. They are both very different from this video, which may be one of the reasons I don't like it that much."

0,"This book has 3 LSAT preptests and explanations for each test. The preptests are:SuperPrep A; February 1996SuperPrep C; February 1999SuperPrep B; February 2000Unfortunately either LSAC outsourced the explanations or they are absolutely horrible at explaining their own test. I actually suspect its the second. LSAC has created a very complex, highly intelligent, extremely complicated and competent test. In every other way they are just totally awful.

It got about halfway through a big file copy when the drive went offline and I haven't been able to get it back since.This is just too flaky, a HDD for backups needs to be johny on the spot and work.

0,We had three of these drives and they all failed within a year!!! This is statiscally impossible without a major design flaw. LaCie refuses to replace a drive which died within three months of being replaced under warranty because they only honor the one year warranty date of the original drive!

0,"I purchased two of these to store a 1.2 TB media collection and to back it up. After 6 months BOTH failed and it's costing me $6000 to get the data back. Lacie has offered to look at the drives, but states that the data will be lost. Never buy a Lacie product."

0,"I'm sorry I paid $10 to go see this film, it's to slow to begin with and to predictable. it was said that it would scary like ""TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE"" not true! how ever it is worth renting this flick, but dont go bragging about and don't buy it either."
0,"Low budget, but beautifly shot, ok I'll give you that. The character build at the beginning was a welcome change, but 40 mins of waiting, way too much. The climax of the film was [...], this movie was suppose to be gut wrenching, nope, no chase, no suspense. Girl tortured for a few minutes, car blows up, girl gets away, girl comes back, girl paralyzed, girl gets shot, guy escapes easily, killer walks, roll the credits. Sorry for the spoilers, but that is the whole movie and no details are left out. Simply pathetic. I'm sorry but I must of missed something somewhere. Worst movie I've watched in years"
0,I know a lot of people didn't like Hostel but I liked Hostel a lot. I started to walk out of the theater for Wolf Creek. It wasn't that scary to me. If you guys hadn't seen Hostel yet ignore the bad reviews. It's a great horror flick and a must see. Do not see Wolf Creek! Wait till it comes on cable. Don't waste your money!
0,"I had to laugh when I read a review on here that said this film's ""disturbingly great."" The only disturbing thing about WOLF CREEK is how slooooooooow the story moves along. I swear, the first two-thirds of this movie's nothing more than the three no-name leads driving around, mumbling intelligible things that had no bearing on the actual plot.After that, there's a twist, but it feels like everything from that point on is done for shock value and really isn't scary or truly disturbing. It was like the filmmaker wanted this to become the Australian version of TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, but they failed miserably in the effort.If you want to watch a ""disturbingly great"" horror film with a foreign flavor, I suggest you pass on this trite film and check out HIGH TENSION. It's faster-paced, has a better story and has an ending that's a whole heck of a lot more rewarding to the audience."
0,"After reading all the great reviews about this movie, I rented it on DVD. What a waste! Wolf Creek has everything a bad horror movie should have in it: potential victims making every mistake in the book so that they are even easier targets for the psycho killer, shallow characters, no background story and an aimless plot. Even the title is ridiculous, since the tourist spot known as Wolf Creek is only featured for about 5 minutes out of the entire movie.The only redeeming quality about it is that it shows some great Australian scenery, but this is no horror film. I mean, even after the major shift in personality, the villain is still pretty likable and not at all credible.I wouldn't recommend it, especially if you like your horror to really scare you. Also, it does nothing for the genre."
0,"my friends inspired and motivated me to watch this movie. Most of them told me it was a great horror flick. I've watched alot of horrors this year, most of them have failed on my 'decent horrors of 2005' list. I had high hopes expecting to finally watch a decent 'horror' movie, unlike the others which i had recently watched (The Skeleton Key, Red Eye , Ring 2, Amityville Horror). Sadly, i came out of the theatre somewhat unfufilled and dissappointed. To the people who gave it 4-5 stars, i dont understand. This is nowhere near a horror, thriller at the least. The character build-up took about an hour, which i found to be o.k. The remaining 60 minutes dissappointed me, as it was meant to be where the 'horror' starts.I dont want to spoil the rest for the others, but in my opinion you are wasting your time. To the People who find Skeleton Key, Amityville Horror, and Ring 2 boring. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!"

0,"It may just be me, but I can't understand why the other reviewers have heaped such praise on this lamentable effort.I was aware that the reception this album received was very mixed, but felt I should find out for myself. To summarise, 'I Like Girls' is good, 'Big Boy', 'Everybody's Stupid' and 'Throw Her Away' are passable, the rest is forgettable. The funny thing about this album is that whilst it has a punky feel, like some of the best songs from the preceding 'Holy Trinity' (KMH, Propaganda, Indiscreet), 'Big Beat' just doesn't seem to carry it off as well. Unfortunately, the ever witty lyrics of Ron Mael clash with a tired sound. Sparks may be cool, but they are NOT HARD. Incidentally, 'I Like Girls' and 'Big Boy' (and bonus track 'Gone With the Wind') can be found on the useful 1974-76 compilation 'In The Swing'."
0,This is perhaps the worst introductory physics book I have encountered as a student.

Then, of course, the quack produces a cure for something they did NOT actually have.The arm lowering technique is simply a parlor trick! I proved it one my friend, a big man who lifts weights. He laid on his back and raised his arm and held it stiff. I could NOT push it down. Then I had him try it again. This time I moved his arm slightly backward, then down easily. Quack! Quack! Quack!There is, of course, the plecebo effect--a real phenomena. People who took two sugar pills got better faster than those who took one."

The food was overly bland and unsatifying. I almost gagged trying to eat some of the recipes because of the strange combinations and textures (...asparagus and egg white omelet). I still use some of the recipes (smoothies, a couple of salads, etc.) but this style did not fit me or my lifestyle. I did the full two weeks (my husband only made it for a couple of days) and still felt hungry constantly, still craved bread and carbohydrates, but I did lose a couple of pounds. It is a difficult regimen and takes all of the flavor out of food. It includes many vinegary, sharp tasting foods that just did not suit my appetite. Maybe it will work for someone else, but it did not work for me for the long term."

I admire his thought provoking lyrics but if the beat ain't hittin I could care less what you're rapping about. Rhymefest used so many R&B; singers I thought I was listening to some old New Edition or After 7 joints not that I don't like those singers but I don't want to hear that on no hip hop album.

0,"I'm a big fan of the Coen brothers but this is by far their worst and easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. It had some interesting moments, but there was no story. I guess that's how it was designed and I'm just not deep enough to appreciate it. The characters are entirely forgettable. The performances are good, but it all amounts to a train wreck of pseudo-intellectual post modern hogwash."
0,"I had to counter the deep thinkers that have some how analyzed this totally plot less wanderings to be worthy of comment.

I can only say, finish your Tom and Jerry comic and get a book with words."
0,"This has to be the worst film made in the last 100 years. Ugly, abhorrent, painful, disgusting and a waste of resources. Sure hope these two sociopaths are being watched. Children and pets are certainly not safe around them. Felt neither sympathy, concern or interest in any of the characters or their actions or activities. Not a moment of humor throughout the entire ordeal. I would have found more pleasure in calling up roto-rooter and having them come over and perform anal surgery without anesthesia than have to watch this again. I, unfortunately, give the benefit of the doubt to people and I believed the reviews on the dvd box - thief, liar, pervert! I kept hoping the chipper/shredder from their Fargo movie would show up and all the characters and the Coen cretins would dive in and we would finally have something to cheer about! Unfortunately you can not return a dvd just because it's a rotten movie. Call the cops. I've been robbed!"
0,"I rented this movie. I'm Jewish and thought it might be fun to watch, since it was billed as a dark comedy.There were a few spots, like the Bar Mitzvah, that had some familiar Jewish tradition. But the rest --Not funny, not profound. No likeable characters. Slow paced and boring. The ending left you hanging, but by then I didn't care anyway.The best part of watching this movie was that I was hemming a pair of pants while I was watching it. Got the pants done, since the movie wasn't very distracting."
0,"...fall asleep about half way through a movie. All the way to the end. I'll admit I was tired when it began, but to actually fall asleep?! Very dull, IMO. Surprising, because I really dig a lot of Coen flicks, and was really looking forward to this one. Woody Allen does this stuff much better - funnier, sadder and more poignant, far more cleverly, and with better music. Can't win 'em all. Will look forward to their next, hope to see them again reach the heights of Fargo, Lebowski, and Man Who Wasn't There."
0,"With the DVD jacket literally covered in 4-star reviews and having loved previous Coen Brothers movies, I thought this was a sure thing.

0,"I realized the other day that everything about Valdemar makes perfect sense if you assume that Mercedes Lackey came up with the world when she was 13 years old. Her heroines are ALWAYS misunderstood adolescents from Oklaho--excuse me, the Boondocks, until a wonderful white horse comes and CHOOSES them because, despite the fact that no one around them ever realized this, they're really special and wonderful. And then they get trained to do great, heroic deeds.It's the perfect adolescent fantasy.Don't get me wrong; I actually quite enjoy her books. However, if you're looking for fantasy with a complex society or characters who aren't universally pure of heart, word, and deed, I would suggest Katherine Kurtz or Steven R. Donaldson. If, however, if you're looking for something to read while recovering from the flu, Mercedes Lackey is just about perfect"

0,"Rather than an immediate sequel ( Rocky II, Rocky III,et al ), Before Sunset simmered for nine years, allowingthe director, Ethan Hawke, and Julie Delpy to ageand grow and calcify. I didn't care for Before Sunrise,principally because I flinch at Ethan Hawke's acting,and because it was a dialogue movie without muchmagic in the dialogue.Before Sunset is another dialogue movie --- but thedialogue is absent any particular clarity or distinction,unless your standard is TV situation comedies. Thereis no significant reach in verbal expression or poetry.I would rather listen to and look at Nick and Nora Charlesnine years later - or Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory( My Diner With Andre ) than these two.The chemistry seems contrived and the ongoing referencesto sexual activities removes the sensuality from therelationship. It does end quite well - fading out withoutany momentous denoument - or declaration that we willhave these two to look forward to again somewheredown the road."
0,I *loved* Before Sunrise and was cautiously optimistic that the sequel would be as excellent.But the dialogue drags (when it's not being PC and pedantic) and the notion that it's romantic to leave your wife and child to take up with the hottie you lft behind bugs me too much.Julie Delpy's talents wasted. Ethan Hawke indulging his politics to inject an anti-gun message in a yawner of a film.PLEASE rent this one before you buy!

0,"I decided to read Immortal in Death after reading other readers' raving reviews of this book. This is a first book by J.D. Robb that I ever read and I was bored to death. It's a blend of mystery with science fiction and for me it does not work in either genre. I find Robb's caracters cartoonish, her storytelling does not grab you, her science fiction does not have an ounce of science or at least of space opera attributes. Her heroine Eve might be liked by ultra feminists, but I prefer Dr. Kay Scarpetta of Patricia Cornwell's as my favorite sleuth and a liberated woman. To each his/her own, though. Ed Gorin."

If the band played alone this would be a fabulous listen, they are very good, but Russell's singing only gets in the way. Do yourself a favor and listen to the samples before you spend money on this album. Russell writes very well but his words are not really conducive to lyrics, there are just too many of them."
0,"The show gives too much service to the ""Rizzles."" Angie Harmon does a great job as Jane, but the Maura we know from the books has been replaced by a Dr. Brennan/Sarah Jessica Parker hybrid. In the books, Jane is a married mother, giving her a lot more depth as well as story options. Maura is in love with a priest- I can see why they would avoid that on TV, but it also flavors a lot of story.The show spends a lot of time with the girls bickering like children or playing gay. It's kind of sad. Why not just make them lovers if that's what the producers think these characters are? Gay or straight, I really hope they stop making these characters act like bimbos. In the books, they are so much more interesting.Not that anyone making the show will read this, but here's hoping."

The only song on here I can actually stand is Stevie Wonders ""Signed, Sealed, Delivered"", because he is a great artist and that is a classic song. But the rest of it is bland stuff that should be saved for adult contemporary radio. And what is the Cranberries ""Dreams"" doing on here? That song has been used countless times aleready for other films and television, and it's getting very old."
0,"Big and clunky. Short cable makes attachment difficult. No volume control, which is absurd. Off switch does not just turn off the amp- it disconnects you entirely. Fixed 2X amplification. On light difficult to see.Other than that, it does work.This is a market begging for a superior product."
0,"I can't believe the number of disappointments on my last order and the Boostaroo was certainly one of them. I bought it as it was featured with the helmet speakers I bought and some of the reviewers of that product commented that the speakers were on the quiet side. First of all, it's about twice as big as I had expected (about the size of a ""Magic Marker"", but thicker) and it did little to help the pathetic speakers. Secondly, the cords jut out perpendicular to the unit, which is not the best design. I would like to see a product that's just an amplifier with the output cord on one end and the input on the other (which is where that is with the current design.) Also, who in the heck needs to split an audio device three ways? Not why I bought it, but made me curious. Maybe if it was just an amplifier, it could be smaller."

Ha, ha, ha, ha!There are not many US released Style Council CDs around these days. You should snatch this up right away. It has, um, a handful of their hits, and a couple of their not-worst songs.Minus 1 star for the bizarro track listing.Minus 1 star for a live version of ""Call Me."" It should have been the demo version. (The ""real"" version stinks!)Minus 1 star because it is only their pop songs and they did some really decent cod jazz in their day.Minus 1 star for not including anything on their last three albums, and by that I mean they only include singles and stuff from their first two albums. Their later music is their most interesting. Confessions of a Pop Group is Weller's most under-rated album ever!So there you go- 1 star left, but this is the best 1 star CD I've ever reviewed!"
0,"The image provided on Amazon.com shows 4 pieces. You really get oe physical piece with two sides. (see the image and look at the first shape that is yellow and brown) There is not 4 pieces to this kit as the image might lead. However, the description does state you get a 1000/6000 Grit combo....so interpret carefully.The quality of the stone seems to be good; I will sharpen with it as soon as I receive my sharpening guide/roller tool."
0,"I purchased the Microsoft keyboard based on the wrist rest, which is very nice. The keyboard has many features, nice soft feel, and the wrist rest works well.Unfortunately, after I installed the hardware, I discovered that the mouse lost functionality within 10 to 15 minutes of use. The troubleshooter suggested moving the receiver closer than 3 feet and/or changing the batteries, and then discontinuing any other wireless products nearby. After taking each of these steps, changing the batteries twice, and numerous reboots, I decided that the product simply does not work well and returned the set. I would not recommend this product."
0,"I bought this the other day and I enjoy it, especially in the car. However, if someone had played it for me without my having heard it before, and then asked me to guess who made the album and when, I would say it was a Jean-Michel Jarre album from the 1970's. There is nothing new, revolutionary, or cutting-edge about Van Dyk's music; I have been listening to the same thing on vinyl by Jarre for 25 years. (Try Oxygene).Although this CD is pleasant, it reminds me of a cover album."
0,"I too feel this is a majorly flawed performance of the works represented. The playing is rushed, has no sense of musical line or style, is outside the bounds of good musical taste, and is loaded with mistakes galore. If you are interested in hearing an accurate, musically aware performance, do not purchase this recording."
0,"This mold is the worst for making letters. The imprint of the letter isn't raised so there is no way to fill in the letter with an accent color then pour the main color. We tried using edible markers and other colorings but there is no way to fill in the letter so our candies will just be plain white, with the W impression. Also, it didn't come with any tips or hints on how to accent the letter, that would have been helpful and probably would've avoided this review."

0,"This book is the most pathetic excuse for marketing and is an embarrassment to the cat lover's community. I gave this book to my brother-in-law to use as he is a great cat lover, and this book scarred their relationship to this day; his cat refuses to go near him for fear of him lifting up his hand/leg even a little bit. His cat is now paranoid of any people. The pictures are obviously digitally edited. I have seen better ... than this. Please do not think twice (or once) about buying this book. Please, do it for the cats."
0,"The book had lots of dialogue that to me was boring. It did take me two days to finish the book because I wanted to know how the story ended. I did find myself skipping quite a bit. In all fairness I'm not a western book fan, but some I've found amazing like Johanna lindsey's ""A heart so wild"" and ""All I need is you"".This story was ok, just the dialogue was boring and there was no chemistry between the characters! it was adventurist with a mysterious plot."
0,"If you have a child that is sensitive to unhappy endings, this is NOT the book to give him or her. My 11 year old daughter was very upset with the ending of the book. She couldn't bear the thought of the girls regressing in age even more. I expect her to have nightmares tonight."

0,I thought this would come in maybe 15 peices no about 1000 little plastic parts. very annoying. The doors donot open well without almost taking the whole item with it. now whats the fun it it? Cheeply made.
0,"This kitchen was a gift from a family member. It took my husband and I hours to put together and punching the too small and cheap plastic pieces out is really irritating and hurt my fingers. My daughter is now almost three and it is just too small to actually pretend to cook on the stove or anything. It is in the corner, and some kids that come over to play will mess with it, but the oven and microwave are too small to actually put any fake foods in them- the fridge is a glorified cabinet etc. I was actually surpirised that something so cheap and lame existed. I want to throw it out, but I feel so ungreatful about how horrible this kitchen is. Other relatives are like, oh she already has a kitchen etc. I am in a bind, so it is in the corner and sometimes my daughter hides toys in the oven. For the love of all that is holy spend a few extra dollars on anything else. When we move soon I am putting it out at the corner and pretending like it got lost."
0,"While the set looks cute, overall it is a very poorly made set. I bought it for my 1 year old for Christmas and will have to replace it. There are so many jagged plastic edges after it is put together that it isn't even safe. I love that there are so many doors and such to open but one has to pull so hard to do so it is almost impossible for a child. I am writing this review to hopefully inform others that you are better off spending the money for a quality kitchen."
0,I spent 3 hours on Christmas Eve assembling this (didn't read the reviews here). It made for a very grumpy Christmas day. It's not very high quality--jagged edges on many pieces. I highly recommend purchasing something else.
0,"I'm a huge, huge fan of the original Trancers. The rest of the series-- not so much. But at least every outing till now had featured original footage of B-Movie king Tim Thomerson. Trancers 6 has the dubious honor of being the first in the series to use stock footage of Thomerson; basically, Sir B-Movie wanted nothing to do with the project. And I don't blame him; Trancers 6 is edges into the realm of C-Movie. The plot makes little to no sense, the dialogue is forced in principle and acted even worse, and the effects are simply laughable. The old B-Movie style effects from the original Trancers had a certain charm to them, perhaps because they didn't try to do too much. Trancers 6 feels like it was made by an overeager college wannabe that just got his first Avid in the mail. It's truly painful to watch. I didn't get through it in the first round through. Really, Trancers 6 has no redeeming qualities. 1/5 stars."
0,"I needed more USB ports so I bought this device. It worked great for about 6 months. Now four of the seven ports do not work. I have rebooted and unplugged and tried different troubleshooting advice but still the front two ports and top two ports in the back do not work. The base is light and doesn't hold the port up but I can deal with that if the thing worked. I am going to trash this one and buy a different brand 7 port USB hub. Hopefully, I will have better luck next time."
0,"Plugged it in, it was fine. Went down to my computer 5 days later and the lights were off, no longer worked. Called IO Gear, took 5 days to get an RMA# so that I could send it back to them for repair. Dealer wouldn't take it back because I had it over a 7-day period (took me a couple days before I installed it) I'm in Canada, so I have to pay extra shipping to US for repair. I don't think it is worth it, I'll probably chuck it out and get another brand.Looks cool and I like the design, except for the base, but the quality is very poor.Glenn"
0,The problem that i have with this DVD was that it was very badly produced...the quality of the video was AWFUL! very INTERLACED and mind you people i have a progressive scanner DVD player...it's soo interlaced that when any of these characters from the show move or talk you can see ghostly artifacts around them! It is RIDICULOUS! DISNEY I HOPE YOU READ THIS! YOU MIGHT AS WELL RELEASE VHS PRODUCTS INSTEAD OF DVDs...THIS DOESNT DESERVE THE NAME DVD..wasted my money! PEOPLE if you like quality do not buy this [...]! until they come to their senses and use progressive video!

0,reading the reviews for this album is destroying my hope for the future of mankind...this band is terrible...tooth and nail should just stop now
0,"This album is terrible. In previous years, i have been somewhat of a fan of Pharrels production and even the production on here is decent, but this a rap album, not an instrumental album meaning that the songs have to actually be good and not just decent beats and slapdash lyrics. Come on Pharrel, i know you can do better."
0,"Awful! Just awful! This shoulda been released as just an instrumental album, and even then it'd be pretty bad. I liked the NERD stuff, but this thing is a waste of all that aluminum . . . ."
0,"In my mind just does not have the lyrical wizardry to it that it needs. Some of the beats are good, but Pharrell is just not a rapper. Look at all the other CD's by the Neptunes, and you see a trend. Lryics are lakcluster, beats are lacking on some tracks, but has a few shining moments. Alas, we buy CD's for a good CD. Not a few good tracks.I guess this album sums it up...in Pharrell's Mind this is hot. However, in reality this CD does not cut it. Do not get me wrong, Pharell is an EXCELLENT PRODUCER. As an rap artist, not."

0,"I have three other Cuisinart pans and they are all 5 stars. This one is ""tippy."" The handle is too heavy in relation to the pan. Potentially dangerous, definitely annoying. Cooks great due to aluminum bottom, but use caution.After 9 months, I rarely use this pan.1 star is all i wold give it now.After 6 years, I NEVER use this pan. It would be gone from my kitchen it it took up more space, and may go in the next round of sending things off to various re-use places - at the recycle center, charity garage sales, charity thrift stores. Still one star.A one star review is a rare one for me to give because they often very personal or about some dumb thing that could have been easily corrected with an exchange or refund. But this is a one star item. The pan tips over and hot stuff spills out. That is bad."
0,"""McCools"" was a rubbish movie, weak in every department, and one of the poorest films I have ever seen. It would seem that the producers were undecided as to whether they were making a porn film or a screwball comedy, and succeeded in doing neither. Their only gameplan was to finish the film with a spoof on The Village People; what an awful lot of effort for one joke!I had only gone to see the film because I am a fan of Reba McEntire, not knowing what to expect. In common with the ethos behind the production, her role as a confessor figure to Paul Reisner, was irrelevant and utterly superfluous. After she had spent a couple of days filming her short sequences, she was called back for post-production work and as a consequence had to cancel some scheduled concerts - what a waste of time!Judging from the length of time they took to release the film, the producers probably realised that they had produced a turkey."
0,"The mystery is why in the world would Michael Douglas want to be one of the producers and appear in this awful movie. Yes, Liv is gorgeous but that doesn't justify wasting a couple of hours on this. Watch it on TV, don't rent or buy it."
0,"DO NOT BUY THIS DVD! I agree with Mr. Campos in every point. It is awful. I'm a native-born Costa Rican. I believe sellers are writing some of the misleading reviews to get people to buy this awful DVD. The video is OVERWHELMENLY hotels and spas. The people and nature of Costa Rica are barely covered. I am an actual (and deeply disappointed) buyer. Breakdown: Hotels and Spas: 75%, hostes: 15%, Nature and people: 10%."
0,"Dr Seleem's academic credentials are not listed anywhere in this publication.This seems an obvious intended omission once you start reading in this text his ideas concerning Egyptian Cosmology, history, science and other religious traditions of the world.Exactly what is Mr. Saleem a ""Doctor of""?He does not state he has a doctorate in Egyptology or Anthropology, Archeology, Linguistics, Comparative Religion or Mythology.From his absurd conculsions and naive speculations on themetaphysical and monotheistic nature of the Egyptian religon and his rantings on the evil foundations of the Western scientific method, one might conclude he never attendedan accredited University or took a single class on comparative religion or mythology.Pass this book up and be happy you did.If someone sends it to you - send it back for a refund.If you are really interested in this subject stick with Falkner and Zahi Hawass."

0,"I returned two of these. The top portion is larger than the bottom and the quilting creates wrinkles & buckling that will not smooth out. You would expect a higher thread count for the money (felt like @ 180). Also, there was very little padding so you don't get what the pictures show."
0,"I read this book because I'm a Bujold fan, especially of her Vorkosigan universe. I have read and re-read her books several times. ""Winterfair Gifts"" is an enjoyable visit to her universe, but not at all on par with her other novels or her previous short stories about Miles Vorkosigan. You certainly won't understand why there are many Miles devotees from reading this short story, which is truly for only Vorkosgian fans.As far as the other stories, boring, boring and boring. The only possible author of interest of Asaro, I found some of the elements in her story interesting. I too agree with a few other reviewers in that I was troubled with the very young age of the protagonists.If you are a fan of one of the authors, please take this book out of the library. This book is a shameless attempt to make money for shoddy second-rate work by beloved authors."
0,"The only song on this album that I have thoroughly enjoyed has been Shortstop by Steve Taylor. I enjoy the other groups (Jars of Clay, Michael Tait, Steven Curtis Chapman, Ginny Owens, PFR, Delirous, & Sixpence), but this album contains what I consider their worst songs so far. I did not enjoy this album considering what I payed for it. If you're looking for a good CCM Compilation CD, stick with the WOW CD's."
0,"I purchased this product simply looking for a set of headphones that would work with my BlackBerry Pearl and were not an asymetrical head set. Right out of the packaging the retractable feature did not work properly. Once I plugged them up to do a test of the headphones in action, I was dissappointed to hear the music coming from the Blackberry's speaker. So they do not even work. Maybe because it was a BlackBerry, maybe not. Bottom line, even if problem is incommpatibility issues with the phone, having actually examined the product in hand, I still would not buy it. The materials feel cheap, and the cord is only 41 inches. which may be fine for people of average height, but at 6'2'' I found the length to be inadequate."
0,"The book supposed to be new, I was buying it for a gift. Now I do not know what to do with it. Have no time to play with returning the item.... uff. All those money lost!"
0,"Ignore the hype (not that there was much anyhow), ignore the 'Oscar' win (they never go to the right people) and most certainly ignore this dull and sickly 'melodrama'. Girl, Interrupted attempts to try and recapture the dark humour of the book but ultimately fails. The characters seem to be extras from One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest (yes, tics and all) and of course the obvious stereotypes are presented; fat girl, thin girl, extremely mad girl, dyke, etc. Even the introduction of Angelina Jolie as the psychotic and downright nasty Lisa fails to save this predictable mess from going downhill. Wonders how she bagged the Oscar, as her performance seems reminiscent of an OTT soap opera actress. Such a shame really, as the talented cast seem capable of better performances and films. A waste of time, money and talent."
0,True it had a couple of good scenes but they didn't balence out the graphic horrers tha still give me nightmares monthes later. Including a scene where they find one of the girls had hung herself & cut herself up. I would not recomend this movie to the sensitive or faint of heart.I had been hoping this movie would help me understand peoples mental health problems. Instead it would very likely drive people to fear & more desire for segrigation.
0,"I was forced to watch this movie and take my word for it.....it was horrible. Maybe some people are interested in a girls relationship with a bunch of nutbags, if so this is a movie for you. If there was an award for worst picture I would vote this one in."

0,"My five year old son finished this ENTIRE game in one day! We have nearly all of the I Spy books and all but one of the I Spy software titles, so my son was expecting a greater challenge with this new software. When the game ended--and he told me he had beat ALL of it without my help--I thought he just clicked the wrong button or something. But, yep, he finished it! This would be a good choice for someone who wants to 'sample' the I Spy software, but for the avid fan, this is going to be a big disappointment. This series is SO popular with my son's age group, it's unfortunate that Wick and Marzollo are not creating new photos instead of rehashing the old ones. New clues are okay, but I think I've memorized all of these pictures!"

0,Jesus this is easily in the running for the worst movie i have ever watched. I am all for independent films but i have seen high schoolers that have made better films than this. The acting is horrible and they sound like they are reading off of que cards the entire movie. The editing is nearly non existent its as if they did it all on a digital camera and just hit play and pause a bunch of times. i honestly can't even figure out how to explain how horrible this movie was. I honestly don't know why i watched the entire film. It had one decent scene near the end of it that lasted a little more than 15 seconds. The only redeeming quality about this movie is that i didn't spend my money on it. I used some VOD bucks amazon so graciously gave me.

After ten minutes, the movie was so bad that our three cats walked out of the room and threatened to leave if they were forced to watch any more of it. We gave it another five minutes and all agreed that we should only show this movie to guests who you never see again."
0,"What did this movie lack that Mike Judge fans will be looking for? Great characters, great story, great script!With incredibly weak characters, and nothing to hang onto, story-wise, I kept waiting for something to gel. It never did. If you're a Mike Judge fan, you kind of have to see it, but you'll probably be unhappy with it.Some of the ""futurisms"" (Starbucks is a place where you can buy sex) are funny, but you can't make a film around that. Maya Rudolph is not pretty, likeable or useful in this movie."
0,"This movie was recommended to us by a learned man who said he hated it when he saw it the first time and then grew to appreciate it, but that it was a clever satirical look at what could happen if we continue to dumb down our kids generation after generation. Candidly, it scared me ... and depressed me. Not sure I'll be able to watch it again ... or to the point of being able to appreciate it's cleverness ... because it IS clever."

0,"A very challenging movie to watch. I have always been a fan of Mike Judge's work, but this time I feel he just did not have the same charm to this film as he did with Office Space or Beavis and Butthead Do America. Idiocracy seemed way too over the top."
0,This movie has a concept that will make you mildly chuckle. That's the first minute of the movie. The rest of the time you'll be sitting with a half-smile on your face waiting for something funny or interesting to happen. This half-smile will eventually turn into a look of disinterest and then the eye-rolling will start. It's a shame because I have a lot of respect for all the people who took part in it and have enjoyed their previous works.
0,I can not recommend this company for international customers. They do not ship with tracking options. The shipping time to i.e Europe is 4-5 weeks. They are not capable of shipping to customers resident in countries not available in their country code choice list. Although they do advise a way of giving your address information if your country is not in their choice list they do not use this information. They did not react properly to information given by both telephone and e-mail. It was simply ignored!
0,"I would give this book five stars! I wasn't able to change the review stars on my kindle. Anyway, I like how Raina in a way has a sort of loyal to both her dad and Gunnar. This book kind of reminds me of Beauty and the Beast, because Belle in the movie is the prisoner sort of and the Beast think he isn't good enough for. Beast falls in love because she calms him and Belle looks beyond to what there is on the outside. I definitely recommend reading this book:]"
0,If you intend to simply play the CDs and get composer and title from the box this is a good value. If you intend to rip this to a digital format like wma or mp3 don't buy it unless you are prepared to re-type all the meta data. Meta data like composer and title is incomplete and or inaccurate.
0,"This is really a piece of junk. I used it for about 5 minutes and the shaft thread was cut. Since it is pretty cheap, I just throw it away. It is still a waste of money. I also ordered and received similar products from others. They are much better. I don't understand how someone can rate this junk so high! It must be rated by their friends."
0,"I usually like Baxter Black, but he was very bad on this video. He poorly read his script and had no emotion in his presentation.

Actually, switching out the thread, fabric, bobbin style, adjusting the bobbin and machine tension all produced no results. It either doen't sew very well, or it tangles and breaks the thread. Granted, we only paid $40 for the machine, but it has gotten very light use, and buying a new machine for simple projects is a huge let down. My advice would be to take the money you were going to spend on this machine, save up a little more, and get something reliable (and with better documentation)."

Well, after 8 months of waiting (and writing the publisher to ask when the Answer Key would arrive), I received my copy. To my surprise, the Answer Key turned out to be a series of photocopies stapled together. In light of this, I'm a bit confused why the publisher kept reassuring me that the book would be sent once they had done another printing -- couldn't they have done the photocopying months ago? In any case, by now I've advanced past the point where this Workbook (even with the Answer Key) is of any use to me. So, again, those who wish to use this book for independent study, beware."

The filling is loose and the pillow does not keep it shape. It is very hard to ""fluff"" the pillow for use each night as it does not even distribute the filling. I HIGHLY recommend a regular well made body pillow if you are accustomed to higher quality pillow. I had really high hopes and was very disappointed."
0,"The design was great. I liked the functionality and interface with the exception of the camera turning on randomly in my pocket. About three months with it though, the face cracked (apparently a common problem with this phone). It did not affect the function of the phone and I used it for another three months. Without dropping it, sticking it in water or any other normal reason, the phone died on me. Luckily for the manufacturer, they don't have to replace it because the crack in the face excuses them. Smart on their part to design a flimsy face so that when their phone does die they can blame it on that, and you are SOL."
0,"I won't write a diatribe about what I hated with this version, so I'll sum it up in as few points as possible:-Samantha Morton too cute and young - she looked like she was 12-Ciaran Hinds: too old and creepy for the part, came across as a raging, shouting bull during the whole movie. Rochester was an angry man but he wasn't THAT angry all the time.-No chemistry whatsoever between the two characters. Samantha Morton looked mortified to have to kiss Ciaran Hinds in the kissing scenes. Frankly, I'd be mortified too.Avoid this version as well as the William Hurt/Charlotte Gainsbourg versions- don't let your curiosity to see another version of Jane Eyre get the best of you. They're both awful. See the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke and Toby Stephens/Ruth Wilson versions instead."
0,"This version of Jane Eyre is absolutely disappointing. It is not faithful to the novel and the acting is horrible. There is no chemistry between Samantha Morton and Ciran Hinds and the emotions they supposedly ""tried"" to embody are so watered down that it is just embarrassing. The best version of Jane Eyre is the one with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton. Do not waste you time and money on this. Not recommended at all !"
0,"I am so disappointed that they made my timeless book into this crappy movie. If I knew they would make this bad of a movie out of my book, I would not have written it! This was the worst adaptation of Jane Eyre EVER!!!!! There was NO chemistry between Jane and Mr. Edwards. It was painful to watch them kiss, I'm not kidding! The only good actress in the whole movie was Gemma Jones who plays Mrs. Fairfax and is from Sense and Sensibility. It is definetly a made for TV movie, and should have never been made into a DVD...if you prefer watching made for TV movies then you'll like it. I recommend either the 1996 version or the 1944 version with Elizabeth Taylor as Helen. This version misses all the important parts, quickly runs through her childhood, and skips her Aunt's death. There is no emotion in this movie and it has no suspense at all. Trust me, don't rent or watch it!! I hope this was helpful."
0,"This ""Film"" version of the classic story by Charlotte Bronte is grossly overacted by Ciaran Hinds. Personally, I found him to be too harsh and cruel, barely even nice. However, Samantha Morton balanced it out quite well as the title character, though. I also didn't like the omission of the middle scenes with Mrs. Reed, which I feel are very important to the story. I prefer Timothy Dalton (4 years before he embodied the role of James Bond in ""The Living Daylights"") as Rochester. He was very well suited to the part; I read somewhere that he considers his role as Edward Rochester his personal favourite. Gemma Jones (""Sense & Sensibility"") was great as Mrs. Fairfax. If you're looking for a faithful version of ""Jane Eyre,"" I highly recommend the 1983 BBC miniseries starring Timothy Dalton, the 1944 version starring Orson Welles or the 1996 version starring William Hurt. This film version is Not Rated."
0,"I initially purchased this book out of respect for Bob Dole's accomplishments as a patriot of the United States and my own interest in World War II. However, I found the book to be a very slow read. Mr.Dole only briefly describes his actual war time experience. Most of the book is him recounting all of the trivial letters he wrote to his family while in college and in the army. It seems as if he included all of these letters in his autobiography just to fill up the pages. (Do we really need to know how he asked his mother to send him fresh laundry and cookies while in college in Kansas?!) The book does describe his recovery from his injuries, which is inspirational. But any history reader who wants to get a good idea of combat should not expect to gain any knowledge from this book."
0,"The kind of rituals described in this book are usually done with the help of an initiated practitioner. Doing them alone is likely to be offensive to these spirits, and being the tricksters that they are, they probably won't come out and say there's a problem, they'll let you think everything's OK while they take subtle revenge. It might take a long time to notice that your bad luck is because of a ritual you did out of a book like this. Not to put too fine a point on it: sincerity will not protect you. Respect is in the eye of the beholder, these spirits want to be approached through the existing channels that they established, taking a DIY approach will not work to your advantage."
0,"Take the word really, multiply it by 100, then add the word bad, and you have the mathematical formula for rating this movie."
0,"We thought this film would be more ""campy,"" like most Tim Burton films. It seemed to be trying to be serious and, unfortunately, just didn't work very well."
0,I found myself chuckling just once throughout the whole movie.The plot was weak and the dialogue mediocre to put it gently.Would not recommend this movie even to my worst enemy
0,What was this movie all about? Did all the funny parts get put into previews? This movie was not funny or entertaining. This is one of only a hand full of movies that I almost stopped watching. It seemed to have no rhyme or reason for anything. I rented this movie because I like Johnny Depp. I have liked a lot of his movies. This was a complete dud!I cannot in good concise even say it is rentable or a time waster. It is neither. Just skip this one.
0,I did not care for this movie. I know that it was a spoof but it was stupid. I would not recommend it.
0,"Tired, unfunny and unimaginative. I couldn't make it further than 40 minutes in and then I had to turn it off. Probably great for FANS of Tim Burton. Not good for everyone else."
0,Mix between Edward Scizzorhand and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Not really worth seeing. Not like original and a weird storyline. Would have probably been better animated.
0,"This was a very dumb movie, I should have listened to the other ratings but figured I would give it a try.. oh well"
0,"Tim Burton's movie adaptation of the Dark Shadows soap opera is a travesty, a waste of valuable celluloid, and an affront to the memory of Jonathan Frid, who makes a cameo appearance. The movie should be offensive to any Dark Shadows fan. It goes without saying that even with its limitations, the original Dark Shadow episodes are far superior to the pablum Burton serves with this movie. Johnny Depp maintains he was a Dark Shadow fan. This hard to believe, because if he was a true fan of the original series he would not have consented to acting in this role and would have had nothing to do with the making of this movie.A real fan of Dark Shadows should stay far, far away."
0,I was disappointed in this. I expected something smarter and funnier. It was just a bit boring.Johnny Depp didn't see to be putting an effort into his performance.
0,"Rented on DIRECTV and have to say enjoyed and appreciated the 1970's humor. BUT the first 5 minutes was of a drag queen movie preview. It's not that we feel ""to each his own"" but we feel movie previews need to be appropriate for all ages, and in our opinion this was preview did not meet that standard. We Called DIRECTV and they said studios who own the movies are responsible for such previews. We are now afraid to purchase the dvd and just feel that people should be aware of this fact. And we also will not support a movie studio that takes such liberties."
0,"I haven't been too fond of Mr. Burton's work for several years, but this takes the cake. He takes a cult classic, a horror soap opera whose cheesy fun factor was the fact that actors, writers and directors took everything seriously while working on a horror soap opera, and turned into one of his idiotic menagerie of weirdness and oddities. The only saving grace in this movie was Eva Green. Everyone else, from Burton's partner in crime Johnny Depp to the kids were all miscast. That includes Mr. Burton himself. Run from this movie, unless you are a masochist."
0,"This movie is poorly written, not funny and has no relation to the television series whatsoever. I was really looking forward to this movie and was saddened to find that it was poorly written and appeared that its creators had never seen the original Dark Shadows television series. The humor was lame and predictable and the story was poorly conceived and acted. Do not waste your money on this trash."
0,"One of the top 5 worst films I have ever ever ever had the displeasure to snooze through. The tone established during the first few minutes is promising. After that, it finds new lows to sink to with each scene - well, I slept through the last half so maybe it redeemed itself. Honestly, this thing actually made me feel kind of sick like I was getting the flu or something. Yes. It's that bad. And I hate saying it because I adore JD and admire TB's other films. WTF happened ??? Bad writing! Bad make up!! Sheesh. I'll shut up now cuz I'm sure u get the pic. It's BAD."
0,Johny Depp is excellent as usual but with a plot that goes nowhere and a weak supporting cast not even a decent performance by the title character can save this movie. If you saw any of the previews you have already seen all of the funny parts of the movie.
0,"This movie in no way, shape or form resembles the original Dark Shadows. What a huge disappointment. What a wasted effort. I was willing to accept it on its own terms, but it fails even there. The comedy isn't funny, and the drama is watered down. The original series told some wonderful stories but was hampered by a crushing schedule and miniscule budget. Ah.. what might have been. :("
0,"If you have even a modicum of affection or respect for the original TV series from 1966-71, you will not buy this movie, you will not rent it, you will not watch clips of it. You will run, not walk, in the opposite direction.Tim Burton and Johnny Depp clearly don't understand the meaning of ""homage."" Homage flatters and honors. This movie ridiculed. In the late and wonderful Jonathan Frid's hands, the character of Barnabas Collins was poignant, nuanced, and at times, quite scary. Johnny Depp turned the character into a candy-colored clown.Even if you are a Burton/Depp fan (and I used to be), you'll see this film for what it is: a complete mishmash that has no clue what it wants to be. Subplots are thrown in, characters reduced to a single note, lots of flash but no substance.I was, and still am, a huge fan of the series. When I saw this movie in the theater, I left in tears. If it were possible to give it negative stars, I would do so."
0,"Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Johnny Depp! Just not in this movie. His acting is spot on as always however, the story line is to much like that of every other vampire movie out there."
0,It couldn't figure out if it was a campy comedy like the Addams Family or a drama like the oldTV show.
0,"The only reason I reviewed this movie was because Amazon wouldn't stop sending me emails to review it. The story has a lot of holes. PERIOD. Tim Burton did his usually superb cinematography, but it didn't make up for the writing in this movie. It had all the potential to be a great dark comedy, but the movie really had no substance. Only way I would own this movie is if it were less than what I paid to rent it or it was on Netflix."
0,"I like vampire movies. I like Johnny Depp. I'm old enough to have watched the original Dark Shadows daytime soap. Unfortunately, this movie was as stupid as the old soap. Depp was his typical character self.... but I have to say....just didn't like it."
0,"My mom knew Jonathan Frid, the original Barnabas, and he must be spinning in his grave at this travesty. I know it was a send-up, but the jokes are corny, and even Johnny Depp could not save this movie."
0,I can't believe I paid to buy this movie. Should have rented at redbox and I still would have felt like I paid too much.
0,"Slow movie with few laughs. Was really expecting more since it's a Burton film. Only rent if you need to watch, do not buy."
0,I was very disappointed by the candy itself. The suckers are so old that the plastic sticks to the candy and the top layer of the candy is sort of sticky and mushy. these are not fresh by any means. Would like a refund.
0,"Similar to the other reviewer, my knife snapped in two pieces, on the blade, just above the handle, while cutting a red potato. This knife has a ""lifetime warranty"" so we'll see if JA Henckels comes through. This is a good-looking, well-balanced knife. But it seems like it shouldn't have snapped, even after 5-years of use."
0,"Note that this gasket has adhesive on one side for easier installation. No drama with the install.The gaskets are very thin. They come in a pack of ten, which, I guess the buyer should beware of anything this cheap. Four times I put one on the tStat housing, each time coolant still leaked. When I pulled the tStat housing off to replace the gasket I had just put on, it was this wet mess, like wet newspaper, with no integrity. Shouldn't the designers have expected that this thing would come into contact with coolant????I did all sorts of RTV applications to protect the gasket and provide a seal. Nothing worked. I got a thick gasket. Leak solved.These gaskets are only good for a tech school that teaches gasket replacement. I can pull a Ford 302 thermostat housing off in 5 minutes thanks to this gasket (including removing the serpentine belt). (I have had so much practice.)For a car your family depends on, find another gasket."

0,I struggled to watch this show from the evry start. I watched till the 3rd episode and I just can't take it anymore. Ms. Grimes is just so robotic she cannot act at all which is very sad as she seems to be one of the main character. Not worth your money at all.
0,"This book reminds me of the saying ""If it takes a lot of words to say what you have in mind, give it more thought.""This is probably the most exhausting, boring, unhelpful tarot book I've ever read. It's like reading someone's dry PhD dissertation. It this had been my intro to tarot, I would have been turned off totally from by it and never continued with the adventure. Tarot is about intuition. I don't need someone trying to make esoteric connections to every possible item or image encountered. Geesh! Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. There is way too much extraneous verbage to sort thru before you found the ""wisdom"" this book."

0,"I'm one of those that want to get away from ""anything Microsoft"" and after reading about all the Linux distros bought the Xandros version.The install was very easy but it wouldn't recognize my second hard drive and I was unable to figure out how to get it to do so.In additon I found general tasks not intuitive at all and nowhere near as good as Windows: this is one thing that MS does well.Another thing I found to be annoying and unnecessary are all the windows that pop up asking cryptic questions.If Xandros is the ""easiest"" Linux distro around, I'd sure hate to tangle with the others.Xandros does run well as far as that's concerned and that's why I'm giving it 2 stars, but I can't understand why they didn't go further and refine it. They should either try to improve on how MS does it or, dare I say it - copy them.As it is, my advice is to wait until they get it right."
0,"The 2 stars is for the CD format not the music. Forget the CD, as this is coming out on DVD Audio on December 10th? That will be 5 stars no doubt."
0,"Sure, Elvis was good...But hasn't his music already been packaged, re-packaged, re-cycled, and re-done until it's available in too many forms. After a while, you begin to bore with the same old songs. Putting them together on a new cd and calling it 1s (copying the Beatles I might add) sounds like a good idea to some, but enough is enough. I'm sure it will sell some cds, but then again people today fall for gimmicks so easily..."
0,"I just want to make a statement by saying Elvis is NOT the King of Rock and Roll. He could not write songs and play instruments so competently as the Great Chuck Berry or Little Richard. He lacked the power and soul of James Brown. His singing was little less than mediocre.This CD is better than most rock albums of the times, but afterall it represents the first ever pop Muzak, the world's greatest imitator of pure R&R music."
0,"This is one of the worst toys I have ever purchased for my daughter. She got this for Christmas, and if the box was not already broken up, I would have shoved the half-assembled peice of junk back in the box and returned it December 26. When I say half assembled, I mean that it had been previously assembled about 6 times and fell apart everytime my daughter so much as breathed on it. I agree with the previous reviewers that the box and pictures were very misleading. The idea and concept was adorable, but the construction was illogical and shotty at best. What burned me up the most was that this was NOT cheap - I paid a lot of money for a bunch of broken peices to sit at the bottom of my toybox. Extremely disappointed!"
0,"Every review posted about this item is right on the money! This SSC castle is the biggest piece of crap I have ever purchase next to the Pony castle in 2004. I cant believe I wasted $40 on this. I have since won the original house from the 80's on that famous auction site for $150 and the quality blows away this crap that they making today. And the new SSC dolls are almost impossible to find in retail stores. I also got almost all of the vintage SSC dolls in the famous auction site too, for LESS than the new crappy dolls are selling for. I too made the mistake in pitching the box. I am going to complain to my credit card company because they quarantee piece of crap defective purchases. I am also complaining to the manufacturer of this garbage. This garbage should be recalled!! Dont waste your money! Knowing now what crap this is, I would not pay $1 for it at a yard sale!"
0,"I've never seen a toy that falls apart as much as this does. It's pretty and had potential to be very cute, but poor manufacturing or something ruined it. My 4 year old gets so frustrated because it constantly falls apart. I've tried and tried and tried to fix it - but it won't stay together - she touches something and it falls off. Not durable and not worth the $$$."
0,"I tried to order several of these and the shipping (for 9) was $44. That is just silly. At the published Amazon guidelines, the box would have to weight more than 70 lbs. I didn't purchase the product. This luring in of customers with a great price and then gouging with a terrible shipping cost is unfair and should be nipped immediately."

I'm thinking of draining the soup and using the vegetables in my own soup to decrease the waste. I can't believe those who left positive reviews - unless I got a bad batch. I'm not willing to try again to find out though. It's simply not worth the risk."
0,This item took up so much space. It made my tv look so much smaller than it already is. Reception didn't get that much better even if I placed it close to the window or other spots in my room. I'd suggest you get a regular rabbit ears antenna.
0,"I thought this movie would follow the typical wrestler theme...where they grew up, how hard it is to make it, great matches of their career. Shame on me.I loved Sting in the late 80's and the 90's but this movie was awful.At times I felt like I was watching SCinemax but it never got to the money shot. During certain parts I thought Sting was having an acid flashback but then stopped and realized that acid flashbacks probably aren't as poorly directed and produced.Stinger, please stick to rastlin and leave wrestling docudrama to projects that get funded by WWE studios. On a side note, I will switch religions to have Sting perform my kids baptism or provide communion in costume with the offering on the tip of a black baseball bat.I've seen better actin in tough actin tinactin.Peace and Love....Peace and Love"

0,"I had just gotten the lasagna pan for christmas. I fell in love with it the moment i saw it. I recently moved in with my fiancee and have been having a hard time with finding things in the house to make due with for cooking things in the oven. So when i got the pan, i loved it. The color was amazing and it was the perfect size. I couldnt wait to use it.I had only used it TWICE when i came home to a broken pan. My fiancee said that when he was washing the dishes he noticed it was leaking, and then it broke in an almost straight line, leaving two big broken pieces and me very upset. I cant say for the rest of the Sango sets or pieces, but i can say that i know i will not be purchasing this brand."
0,"I gave these 2 stars because they worked nice for the first couple of months, even cut through chicken bones. But just like the other reviews, the spring rusted terribly and the spring tends to pop off too easily at the most inconvenient moment. I used these for making chicken soup alot, but noticed that it also doesn't always come clean between the blades and when using on chicken I like to be extra careful. So the next set I get I'll look for a set where the blades unhinge to make sure they come clean and not from Henckels this time."
0,"Word of warning, this album does not sound like other stormwitch releases. This is experimental and rather odd, poppy art school rock. Nothing to do with the great heavy rock classics they made in 80's, nor even melodic power metal of their later releases. So if you are into raw heavy rock try Stronger than heaven or Tales of terror instead, I guarantee you won't be disappointed."
0,"I found this product disappointing for several reasons. The number of spaces available for the address field was too short to accommodate long addresses. The touchpad was frustrating to use because the letter and numbers did not exactly match up with the locations to touch with the stylus. This made entering data somewhat slow. Finally, the PC synch program was unattractive and less user friendly than on my previous Rolodex organizer. I would not buy this product again."

0,The only good thing about this book is that it will make you fall asleep. Highly recommended to insomniacs! I was expecting to learn about the making of the King James Bible and instead got lost in the irrelevant and superfluous material.

0,These knives do not live up to the Henckel name. Thin serrated steel that bends easily. I returned them and do not recommend them.
0,Henckels are well known for their use by culinary art professionals. Because of the name alone we purchased this set for a working chef. Unfortunately the price alone should have warned us. This set is not up to the standards for chefs who use thicker blades and use knives that can stand up to sharpening and over use. We are keeping them and will probably save them to give as a wedding gift. They are a good set for Home use.
0,"As soon as I got these knives I used them and rinsed them, then left them wet for a couple of days. I noticed rust spots and was very disappointed. I looked at the literature that came with them and noticed the phrase, ""No metal is completely stainless"" or something like that. B.S. The knives I bought at the 99 cent only store (6 of them for 99 cents) have NEVER rusted and I treat them the same way, i.e. rinse them and leave them wet. In my opinion these are cheap, junky knives."
0,"Although i have not purchased this set, i will tell you that any 13 piece knife set from Henckels for under $40 is definately made in china, which basically means it sucks. Although they may be fine bang for your buck, if you really want quality then buy a set made in Germany. Brands like Henckels and Wusthoff are exceptional knives made in Germany however they have factories in china which make cheaper knives with far inferrior quality but still bare the prestigious name. Just a thought, cheers."
0,"Don't let the brand name fool you. This is a really cheap set of knives and I am shocked that Henckels would even put their name on it. The blades are thin and the handles are poor as well. Seems like the kind of knives you'd buy in a pinch at the supermarket. It may seem like a great deal, but it really isn't when you have to trash it and buy a better set."
0,"Unfortunately, I have some Henckel products that date back to the nineteen twenties (beautiful scissors) and some to the nineteen forties (knives). I don't think these can compare and they come with so many instructions: how to clean, how to use. I really haven't used them yet. I wish they were still made in Germany.Mallory Semple"
0,I did not feel this product repersented the well known Henckelsquality. I would not purchase again.I have several older Henckels I love.
0,"I got these knives as a gift... and the block is nice, sure, but these things are cheap. Instead of a good solid edge, they all have this strange semi-serrated edge... sure, it cuts, but it's cheap and catches on your food if you're making fine slices. And the plastic handles and weighting and... I suppose I could go on, but knives generally are what you pay for, and the price on these are cheap."
0,"I was very unhappy with these knives. I expected smooth-edged sharpenable knives that keep their sharpness well. These are all serrated. Every one! They are no better than those knives you see on TV that demonstrate their sharpness by cutting through an aluminum can. Not that difficult or impressive a feat with a new serrated edge knife (try it yourself!). All hype, no quality. Even the wooden block was poorly constructed."
0,I really enjoyed the first two books in the series. I started reading the third book and the Tellerman's aren't in the book. It's dissapointing considering that's why I bought the book. I don't know how this book can be considered part of the series. I liked the Tellerman kids.

0,"This is just another example of a Liberal academic distorting the once sacred tradition of the Nicene Creed with his own agenda. I to have repeated and studied the creeds for years and can't disagree with Willis' views enough. I am flabbergasted at his personal emotionalized feelings of what they means or what they could mean to each individual. The Creeds have been solid (militant) foundations of truth that have brought people together in their one true faith for centuries, it was something that could be agreed upon to promote unity and community. It was more or less instituted to weed out people like Willis and his new age views that promote self central focus instead of putting Christ as the central focus. It is scary to know that this is what the so called theological elites are teaching about Christianity."

A couple of mornings later, I got in my car and noticed the Garmin navigation unit was on the floor and the suction part on the windshield. It did not even last 24 hours. The rubber had ripped from the weight of my little Nuvi350 navigation. The original mounting unit that looked just like the one I bought on Amazon lasted 5 years. This one lasted two days. I am going to attempt to return the unit for replacement this weekend, since this one was obviously defective."
0,I received the wrong Suction Cup mount and I have already returned it. I am still waiting for them to get back to me. Once I receive the right product I will give them a review. Best Wishes....MohanIt is more than 3 months after I returned the product but I have not received the product or my money back. Very disappointed. This is totally unprofessional.
0,"I only needed the suction cup window bracket, but could not find just that alone. So I ordered this set. The ball at the end of the suction arm is too large to attach to the bracket that attaches to the GPS - and came with the set. However it did fit the bracket that I had already, so my goal was reached. If you need both parts I would not use this vendor. They seem to mix-match parts without confirming a good fit. I am giving it one star even though I can use the suction arm - just to give a warning to others who may expect a set to fit properly."
0,"Good concept just terrible design, whoever designed this product obviously did not use it. The output jack won't fit the connector because plastic covers the hole. You have to drill out plastic on one side and shave connector to make it fit, I should have just sent back but figured too much of a hassle. Search for another company I have had problems with Belkin before."
0,"DO not be fooled! This video hits collection has really no extra footage of anything that no Blondie fan has not already seen! The picture quality is no better! You are better off buying Blondie's Greatest Video Hits Collection than anything else! I even thought the sound quality to Heart of Glass was actually bad compared to that of the Greatest Video Hits Collection. The only thing that I really liked about this video collection was the way they re-did the Tide is High video. Other than that, don't waste your money even at the very low price! I would recommend to any Blondie fan to buy or stick with their Greatest Video Hits Collection."
0,"Could've been cool. Could've been great. But this Christmas album is something I hate.First, the musicians involved -- none are listed in the liner notes or their website, and I can understand why, but Jim Curtiss at least had the gumption to take credit as project coordinator -- didn't give the music any oomph. Instead, they (identified covertly as Santa Claws & the Naughty but Nice Orchestra) took the familiar melodies of ""You Shook Me All Night Long,"" ""Back in Black,"" ""Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap"" and ""Highway to Hell,"" among others, and watered them down to something even elevators would be ashamed to play. Then, to give them that special Christmas cheer, they added sleigh bells in the background. Yep, that's it. That's the big secret behind this daring recording.Whoop-de-flippin'-doo.This album commits the ultimate musical sin of being dull and uninteresting. Perry Como rocks harder than this.by Tom Knapp, Rambles.(net) editor"

0,"Sorry, I wasn't satisfied with TA. I was looking for more specifics about an alternative space program that started in the 1940's. Instead, I got a silly plot set ahead to the 1990's with a disappointing ending.

0,"I bought this ""Functional Reference Grammar"" just because I wanted to own one concise grammar with plenty of examples and clear explanations of some complicated chinese grammar parts. It was a big surprised when I found out that in Chinese grammar book are no Chinese characters. It is quite obvious it makes the book nearly useless because Chinese language cannot exist without Chinese characters. I didn't explore the book anymore and I do higly recommend ""Modern Mandarin Chinese Grammar"" by Claudia Ross."
0,"I was unpleasantly surpised to be disappointed in this book. I'd read the author's hype and expected that it would be on target. To read the 'reviews' on this site, you'd expect to be promoted instantly after reading this tomb--literally. Instead I found it to be superficial, trite, and unintentionally funny. Schneider posts himself as an expert in management, but gives basic instructions that are decades outdated. That isn't the way I see Tony! He is up to date and wrestles with the issues of being a good manager on a daily basis. Save your money and spend it on 'Execution', or Jack Welch."
0,"This book is your typical Diana Palmer. Young virginal girl, much older experienced guy. However the guy is about as unlikeable as a hero can get. Throughout the novel he is malignant, unapproachable and an insulting jerk who is obviously using this as a facade to hide his real feelings for our heroine, Maggie. Typically he doesn't realize how much of a jerk he is and how much he loves her until a near fatal accident nearly takes Maggie away from him. Cliche, anyone? I thought the whole purpose of romances was to glorify in how we wish men were, not remind us of how boorish they can be, also with very little sensuality to even save this book, its a bust, avoid at all cost!"

0,"I purchased this bag to keep my Wii games and nunchucks in. I wanted an attractive bag in my family room, next to my Wii. I realize that is not the intended purpose of this bag. It is so small that with my 6 games (in plastic cases), and two nunchucks, it barely closes. The cardboard cased Links Crossbow and Wii Sports fit in the front pocket. Instruction manuals don't fit. Hoped my extra two guest wimotes would fit. No chance.The quality of the bag is fine. It looks nice. For the prices charged on Wii goods, give us some value. I wish I went I went to the local bowling alley and purchased a child's bowling bag to keep my Wii accessories in. They are $15, larger, and more attractive.The bag is not large enough for its intended purpose. I usually give high ratings. See my reviews. Not on this mini."
0,"The Wii Messenger Bag is definately cute, I'll give it that. But, it's way too small. Controllers would not fit in side compartments like picture depicted. And if I put the wheel in the front compartment the front flap would not snap closed. With the console being so small, this would've been the perfect opportunity to make a roomier bag to hold things (like even the basics)more comfortably. Small console doesn't have to mean small small bag. My son is actually using his Xbox 360 back pack for his Wii. It's not designed for the Wii, which stinks, but he doesn't have to cram things in. My advice, purchase something else that's bigger, or wait for Nintendo to make something that's bigger."
0,"This keyboard did everything I wanted except make it possible for me to type. I have a small tablet PC that I use on the road. Occasionally I need to type something long, so I decided to buy this keyboard. It rolls up just fine, connects just fine, resists spills just fine, weighs next to nothing -- it does everything but produce a letter on the screen when you hit it with your finger. I kept having to whack each key multiple times to make a letter appear. The space bar was especially troublesome. It took me so much time to type that I eventually gave up and just wrote on the tablet screen instead, because it was faster. I still want a flexible keyboard that works, though."
0,"I bought this because the preview clip showed some moves that looked new and interesting. Only problem is the same handful of moves is done over, and over, and over, and over, and you look at the clock thinking ""surely this must be over soon"", only to find out only 5 minutes has gone by. The instructors in the video often look like they just learned this routine and it is a rehearsal, not a finished product. Sadly, The Firm is not what it used to be. I'm returning this and ordering Tracie Long and FitPrime workouts. In the meantime, I'm dusting off my old classic Firm workouts and using them, even if they are dated."
0,"The speaker on this phone is too quiet, you can't open it with one hand, and it doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles. The only thing I like about it is that it is fairly sturdy.

I thought maybe it was a Windows 7 issue, but it no longer is seen as a USB device on an XP machine I also connected it to, and didn't work any better on either machine with another drive attached.

0,"Much of Celtic art is very colorful, yet I found the examples in this book to often have only 3-5 real color variations. Most of the designs concentrated on crosses and swirls, and of the 75 designs listed, most of them are just small repeatable motifs. I was hoping for some actual Celtic Art reproductions pieces and a lot more big complete projects to do, rather than just ornamental designs. I was so disappointed with this book, knowing that I would never stitch anything from it, that I returned it.The book does offer a brief history of Celtic art and each different type of design has an introduction explaining it's history. I did find this quite interesting.Since tastes in stitching projects are so wide, this book may have exactly what you're looking for. I would just suggest you try to get a look at it first to be sure before ordering site unseen."
0,"In the book, the authors state as fact that ect.org, my website and organization, is run by Scientology. That is absolutely false (and libelous). In fact, my attorney sent numerous letters to the publisher and authors, which were ignored.All it would have taken would have been one email to ASK me if I'm a Scientologist. They either were too careless or they weren't interested in changing their preconceived notions.This kind of bad research makes everything else they've written suspect. Terrible work. Would love for the authors to respond, but they're likely too busy not researching other things. A history professor and sociologist...bad work, you two.oh, p.s. I'm a Presbyterian. Maybe your next book you should say I'm jihad?"
0,"... when I rate my all-time favorite artist, Sarah McLachlan, with a ONE STAR rating.This CD uses a copy protection software that makes it impossible for me to listen to it on my Ipod, thus making it pretty much worthless to me. Ipod lovers, beware! The software only makes secure WMAs (Windows Media... Gates gains another proprietary software!) so it won't work with many portable players."
0,"I bought this CD and was very excited when it arrived at my door. I eager put it into my CD player, and the first song kicks in. My head nearly exploded from the drumming. I found it so abrasive that I had to switch to the next song. This continued throughout the entire disc. I couldn't stand it. This drummer sits behind his kit and just whacks his snare drum. What about drum rolls? All on snare drum. The drumming is so loud it's ridiculous. Whoever produced this CD must have been deaf. Flipping through the liner notes, I nearly laughed myself to tears. The lyrics are so bad it's painful to think people are moved by this stuff. If you are seeking to become the world's worst drummer and are looking for a role model, buy this disc. You might also want to get it if you enjoy terrible lyrics. If this is the case, Stratovarius has what you're looking for."
0,"You know when you are in a shopping mall and enter one of those lifts with background music from a loudspeaker and your thought is a 1 second contemplation wondering ""Hmmm this music is nice"" and then when you leave the lift you forget about what you heard?Well this music is just that. Not at all what I expected from a group calling themselves 'Alpha Centauri'. Even the song titles belie the fact and misinterpret what the song may sound like that. This music is jazzy/electronica and pop mixed together. Its a totally missable album and I will not be listening to this CD again."
0,"This book is full of errors and inconsistencies. They do not fully explain why a certain answer is right and this can be very frustrating when your understanding of the question is already hanging by a thread. I do not like the sarcastic tone this book uses when refering to the people who made up the test. And no, the reading passages do not make me want to throw them across the room. I want to understand them so that I can get a good score. I don't need joking around, I need help and this book does not give it. Nova's ""Master The LSAT"" is full of useful information about the LSAT and they actually help you understand the test better. Go with that one instead even though it is a little more expensive. If you have already bought ""Cracking the LSAT,"" throw it across the room and buy Nova's book. P.S. I do not work for the LSAT or Nova."

0,I have cut my husbands hair for 3 years now. I have always used Wahl products and never have encountered a problem until I bought this item. The trimmer does not align correctly to the main blade and therefore does not make the proper horizontal movement to actually cut the hair. I ended up returning it. The only good thing I can say was that amazon did a great job with delivery time and accepting return/crediting my account. Over all I recommend Amazon; I do not recommend this product. I would purchase a Wahl product that has the smaller trimmer separately (not interconnected with the main trimmer. Thank you.
0,"I thought we'd upgrade our home clippers and get these since they seemed a little better quality than the ones we already. They did not cut cleanly, I had to go over the same spot many times. These also vibrated so loudly that it hurt my hubby's hearing and I had to return them."
0,"Not worth the money!! This bean bag chair lasted only a little over 4 months. All the beans are flat so its not worth the 1/2 refund. I bought this for my son's 10 B-day he weighs about 85lbs.

Funny thing Is I bought one for my 9 yr old son at a second hand store that looked cheaper but for 2 dollars it is still holding its shape and is still full!!! and its been three and 1/2 months."
0,"I love the Firm and particularly Allie, but I'm very disappointed with this and the other new Firm DVDs. Some of the four-limb segments are good, but I find the aerobics segments unnecessarily complicated and they don't even raise my heart rate. With my older Firm DVDs, I always feel like I've had a workout; with these new ones, I don't. Also, these new routines feel harder on my knees (because of twisting more than impact) and back. I have minor back problems, and I find myself modifying the moves in these new DVDs to protect my back from being strained/""put out."" And I miss the fannylifter/transfirmer. I don't know if these changes are because Gaiam now owns the Firm, but I really hope they go back to the more intense, more straight forward routines. I would return this one and get my money back if I could. Sorry Allie!"
0,"This book is really just a relatively boring look at perverse psychological adaptation.

0,"This Screen is horrible, the screen is -just- big enough to cover the Zens own screen, so you have to take it off and re-try a few times before you get it on correctly, but when you do that, the sticky part picks up dirt (from the air apparently as i didn't set it down, and it wasn't on the only corner my finger was on) which leave air bubbles. Then when you clean it or try to get the air bubbles out the -soft- cloth made FOR this purpose scratches the screen (Not the players, just the protectors), It comes with three screens, but I think of it as three trys.The reason I bought this is because I have a ClearTouch Crystal Screen Protector which collected a bit of dust when I was cleaning it (My own fault) so I wanted a replacement. you know what? I still use the ClearTouch even with the dirt.I will say the Case Cover and Armband are OK but I'm sure you could find better and I'm POSITIVE you can find a better screen."
0,"We really loved the look of it and it did the job (albeit slower than our 20+ year old not-so-pretty toaster), but in its last months alive, the spring that keeps the food in the toaster stopped working and you had to hold it down continuously. Then it just stopped working all together. At that time we had bought three different items made by Hamilton Beach and each one malfunctioned much earlier than even a ""cheaper"" product would. You are much better off paying less for a different brand unless you are cool with having to replace everything regularly. HB just doesn't make things to last.In general many products nowadays are made to not last as long as they used to (we actually bought two of this toaster with that in mind; the second one is already starting to show the spring issue). But with the amount of money you have to pay for this product you would think it would have lasted long enough to get some value out of it. You are better off buying a $15 toaster."

0,"Luurie tries for the wide-screen panoramic approach to events/characters, but uses such minute brush-srokes that the total effect is both muted and inconclusive. The characters largely don't connect although they share a vivid physical space. Interior monolgues/motivations don't combine surprisingly or surprisefully. Occasionally there are glompses of the 'old' Alison Lurie (the restaurant scene, but these are few and far between. Reading the book is a bit like watching a wave, it has a power and beauty but it doesn't hold together and it ends up a trickle losing itself on the sand. Perhaps Lurie is saying: life is diffuse and neatness of plot/motivation is an author's con, but without that neatness there is only space and diffuseness, and that's not enough."
0,"Although I read through this book rather quickly, I kept hoping for more of a sense of ""closure"" for all the characters. Wilkie and Jenny Walker, and a number of others, were meant to be sympathetic characters, but they somehow lacked the warmth I needed to feel this way. Not enough information was given about them to make me in touch with them. Lurie would present little tidbits of information and just when I thought I would learn something intimate, another character would be introduced, leaving previous descriptions simply floating. It was distracting and at times confusing. I expected more from Lurie, who has an established reputation. As my review title explains, it seems as if the last hundred pages are missing. Just as the characters are reaching the turning points in their lives, the book ends. There is no denouement. A climax, but no release."

A few months later....oops....it fell in the shower but did continue to work. Went to use it again recently and now it is DEAD! I won't buy this one again. I didn't like it since day one. The one positive thing about it though, is that it did stay charged for a decent period of time."
0,"I've owned two of these and since the second one did what the first one did, I have to say they're complete garbage. Almost to the point of being a scam.After 4 to 6 months - when you take it off the charger and turn it on, there's a few seconds pause before the motor kicks in. Over the next month or two after that, that pause becomes longer and longer until the unit simply won't turn on anymore.It's not the battery - the device works fine and has a strong charge once it turns on. And I never submerged it in water. It seems like a defect in the on/off switch.If you feel like you wouldn't mind having to buy one of these every 5 or 6 months then buy it: it does the job well while it works.I simply believe they should last a couple years. It's obvious that Panasonic blew it with this razor."
0,"I was completely unimpressed with this shaver. Perhaps I received a defective one, but it scratched my legs all up. The design on the shaver part is a bad one (right next to the bikini trimmer pop-up portion). It made the edges of the shaver scratch my legs as I attempted to shave. This is the worst shaver I've ever used - and I've been using electric shavers for about 15 years. I sent it right on back to Amazon. I have to say I was extremely impressed with Amazon though - they fully refunded my money, even including what I paid to ship it back to them."

0,"Like ""Kari"" from Colorado, I've always used Remington ladies razors and needed a new one, so I started researching and found this Panasonic. I decided to give it a try since it was less expensive and sounded like it would work well. I am SO SORRY I spent my money on this one and will be going back to Remington even though they cost a little more. I can't believe there are not more women complaining about how uncomfortable this razor is to use! Like Kari, I ended up with scratches up and down my legs that actually burned until they healed (from the raised sides)..OUCH!! I do NOT get a close shave like I did with my Remington and it takes me twice the time because I have to keep going over and over the same areas. Very disappointed with this purchase!"
0,"This shaver is a joke. The rotating head really serves no function. There is a plastic roller between the two blades which makes the levels between them uneven and gives you a very stubbly shave instead of a clean smooth one. You have to go over and over the same section and you still can't get rid of the stubble. Charge doenst last long inspite of what they claim. I have started holding the shaver rotated so taht its dorsal side faces teh skin ( the opposite of the natural ergonomic position to hold), coz that gives me a slightly less stubbly shave. I will be happy when this shaver conks off so I can buy a new one without feeling too guilty of buying a new shaver so soon! Hate it!"
0,"I purchased this shaver in July of 2011. By the end of August, the pop-up trimmer switch had jammed. I called the warranty number for Panasonic. After the ""automated assistant"" was unable to understand what I needed, I was referred to a human who also had trouble understanding what I needed. She told me I would need to ship my entire razor to either New York or California to have it fixed. I asked if I would have to pay shipping; she did not answer. She gave me a telephone number to call which was not toll free. I asked for and received a toll-free number, but when I called it I was referred to the non-toll free number. The razor cost less than $30; it's not worth paid calls and shipping costs and who knows how long a wait to get it fixed. I'll just buy a different razor to replace it, and it won't be a Panasonic!"

0,"I purchased this in November of 2011. Granted that's awhile ago. My main problem is, once the battery stops charging, you can't replace the battery. I took it apart to see if there was a rechargeable battery inside. If you plan to do the same, don't bother. I thought it should last at least a year AND have replaceable batteries. Now it just has to go to the landfill. I gave it 2 stars only because it did work well for a shaver. Not as close as a blade razor but good enough if you're not picky about being picky"

0,"This mic cable was DOA. I will avoid purchasing Pyle products in the future.Just go to Guitar Center and buy a Live Wire cable, it's not as long but at least it works."
0,This product is so useless.I bought this 15-20 days back. I connected this cable to my mic and havent removed it since then but it is so weird that the cable has started having some loose contact. Sound output gets interupted quite frequently and is so annoying too. Please dont buy this product. The third party vendor on Amazon who sells this product should not sell such low quality products though this is cheaply priced product.
0,"That this is called a ""biography"" is a travesty.The writer uses the incomparable St. Paul, perhaps the most significant of all Christ's apostles, as little more than a dumb ""Howdy Doody"" to say what the writer's own little mind thinks of this great person. If one would call it ""intellectual"", that being an attempt to understand the subject, that would be one thing. After all, everyone has a right to say the moon is ""blue"" and the sun, ""green""....which is what this fellow is doing to an individual who is unable to protest.If you are really bored and there is nothing else around to read, read it.....but please bear in mind that ""Rabbi Paul"" is really a piece of fiction rather than any sort of ""biography""."
0,Monotonous and lack luster performances; the words and lyrics do not resonate with an authenticity. A total drag to listen to.
0,"I owned this backpack for approx. 7 months before the zipper lost one of the ""teeth"", had one of the zipper parts come off track, and had this zipper come away from the seem. I was using this backpack for school. Since I am still in high school I had 3-4 textbooks in it at a time carrying it from class to class. This backpack could probably handle the abuse it would get from a middle schooler carrying lighter loads and only to and from school, or a person taking it on a vacation trip packing lightly and only clothing and essentials."
0,"This backpack is not in Zebra, black, as is described in the title. Besides black and white, there is also blue, yellow, green, orange on the edge of the black part, which make the backpack look dirty and messy."
0,"i was thoroughly un-impressed with this movie. i am a fan of hayden christensen, but i think he has had his better acting moments. i got about half-way through this movie, then quit from absolute boredom. if you wanna see a really good movie with him in it, watch the thriller 'Awake'. now THAT is a good movie."
0,"I read the book first and was seriously disappointed that they had to make the bad guys ""religious bigots"" vs the terrorist bad guys to start and then the people 'in power' who wanted to use / exploit his ability. I thought the book was great, as were the following novels, and look forward to the movie moguls following the book, instead of hijacking the script."
0,"I'll warn you now, if you have read the book & enjoyed it avoid this movie at all costs, it will only make you angry.The only thing Doug Liman (the director), used from the book was the two lead characters names & the ability to teleport. 95 % of everything else is brand new and not for the better, they might as well have ran a disclaimer at the beginning of the movie stating ""this movie is geared for 12 year olds"". It will be hard to read the book again & enjoy it as much as I used to."
0,Second only to Cloverfield in the list of movies I officially wish I had never wasted my time on. Hayden Christiansen may be this generation's Keanu Reeves. That is not a compliment.
0,"What a great idea for a film but the story did not just fall through it fell all the way to China. Watching this movie made you want to go see the dentist as that would be a better story with a good ending.If you have two hours to kill watch the Muppets in Space, it was better Sci-fi then this."

0,"Soulja Slim is dead, RIP man. But heres somethings about the album, the beat was okay. Recording sounded like my bassment. The man has little flow and he is most of the times off beat. The voice is hoarse and sounds nothing like Juvenile. The guest appearances are great but Soulja Slim was so so. He is REAL, he is GANGSTA, and he is straight from the gutta, but this style barely makes up for his lack of charisma in his voice. BG is holdin it down in this album. Good thing, no 100 underground no limit artists on this album, but no C-Murder either. I have alotta respect for this guy, but this is his last album and i probably won't get to hear anything improved from this guy."

0,"From the picture, it looks like there's enough of a ""bowl"" to collect the water when it drains off the soap. Yes, the prongs (on both sides) will allow the soap to drain but I leave my bars of soap on top of the kitchen and bathroom sinks. No bowl. In fact, there are holes in the bottom of this thing so the water is going to keep draining onto the sink tops solving nothing unless I find some kind of small bowl it will fit into to catch the water (I don't have anything like that.). In that case, I won't need the soap saver. And it's made in CHINA where they sit around the supper table laughing at us for what they did to the Americans today. If they'd just recessed the bottom enough to catch the water and left the holes out . . . Sometimes I get the feeling they're doing all this bad designing/engineering on purpose because it is soooo consistent."

0,"This thing overheated before I even had a chance to turn it on to use it! It got VERY warm the minute I plugged it in, and when I did try to use it, it literally worked for a short burst and shut down, and even the next day it wouldn't turn back on. It smelled like melting plastic and I was waiting for this thing to spark up and catch fire. This appliance is NOT UL listed, and while it is made up to look like it is, it does not work properly. Beware if you buy this one, go spend an extra ten bucks and get a brand you're familiar with. I don't be getting an off-brand appliance again!"
0,"I began to have high, romantic hopes from book 1, The Book of Earth, but they were dashed by this last book. If you are hoping that this book will have a satisfying ending, think again.In her typical style, Marjorie B. Kellogg builds up what the reader believes to be a satisfying conclusion of events, but then dashes our hopes in the last moments. This book is a painful anxiety-creating experience.The author takes the easy way out in ending her most villainous characters. The confrontations between good and evil that the reader comes to expect never happen, leaving the reader (at least in my case) feeling cheated and as though the author gave up in the end. I feel that she chose the easy way out and wasted her time creating dynamic characters, only to dash our hopes of a good read in the end.I wasted my time on this entire series, and I do not recommend this novel to anyone with romantic notions, nor hopes for the futures of the characters!"
0,"I got a freaking grip on this album, and it stinks. Sam bin Laden, oops, Sam Coomes and Janet Weiss can't write em like like they used to. Skip this one and get ""Field Studies"" instead. Save your money instead of blowing it on this tedious tripe."
0,"Having been a huge fan of CSI (Las Vegas only) I have been sorely disappointed with season 9. We have all the seasons on DVD (cable not available and don't want a dish) and recently began watching this season. My dismay is not so much with the loss of characters but the increased shock value and gory-ness of the current season. Previous seasons focused more on ""solving the puzzle"" of the crime while this season seems to focus more on the portrayal of the crime (shock value.) The recent episode I watched had a whole sequence at the beginning where a woman was hunted down and strangled (took 1 -2 minutes.) Sorry, I just couldn't watch. The characters haven't really melded yet either which makes for awkward dialogue. Have put it aside for now, may come back to it later.....very disappointed. I guess it was to be expected, most shows don't have a run for this long without the edges starting to fray...."
0,Another CSI without any subtitles (including English). Usually you take a risk when you order because Amazon is so slack about providing this information but this time the product description actually indicates that they are available. Very disappointing.
0,"It took only two hours to go through the whole game, and that included spending a half an hour on the last stunt level. The physics are not well implemented, especially when the car hits a jump or an invisible wall. The A.I. also feels very old, their paths are almost too predictible. Not worth the money with games like Need For Speed : Underground 1 and 2 selling for close to the same price."

0,"I remember playing Chinese Checkers as a child and loving it. I bought this for my 9-year-old for Christmas. I didn't want to spend a lot of money, just in case he didn't think it was fun. When it said the product dimensions were 12.2 x 12.2, I thought that meant the game board, not the box! I guess I should have known better when it also said it was 1.5"". It also said it was a ""colorful, sturdy game board"" but that's not true. I was so disappointed to find it's a fold-able board which means it does not lay flat! Kind of hard to play with marbles on a surface that isn't flat.I also purchased a Checkers game made by the same company. It's more what I expected. The board is one piece and made of particle board (or something like it).I would not purchase this Chinese Checkers set nor would I recommend it to anyone."
0,"The lube stick is a good idea, with a good shape and size for application and would have reduced normal mess that is associated with wax applications. The wax seems to work okay, but I've not used a great deal of it. But, the tube design leaves a lot to be desired. You push the wax up from the bottom, which is good, only exposing as much as you want. But, the stupid cap is made to go on the INSIDE of the tube, so either you have to push the wax back down into the tube to give clearance to the cap or you have to leave off the cap and allow any airborne contaminants to get on the wax. It's such a simple thing that one has to wonder if the designer ever actually used such products.Lastly, the cost of the product combined with shipping charges doesn't seem like a good value to me. I'll not be buying another one when this one is used up."

I enjoy watching a lot of the WWE's documentaries since the majority of them offer glimpses of why I enjoy watching wrestling to non-fans. But while half of the ""OMG!"" moments on here are valid pieces of history that still play well today, the other half would make me cringe while non-fans would look at me and say, ""You really enjoy this?""Now that I've seen this on my own, I don't have to be in the same room with a non-fan while Mae Young gives birth to a rubber hand..."
0,"This would have been a very good DVD release if not for the incredibly annoying, hip-hop tinged intonation of ""Oh My God"" in between every single segment! Seriously, it got so annoying that I nearly turned it off. The segments themselves were pretty good and thankfully there was no censorship, but I just had a really hard time getting past what has to be the most annoying theme music of all time being played between every segment."
0,"After 3 listens I must say I am 100% underwhelmed. First of all, I thought there would be at least a little originality and creativity in there, but no...none of this is anything I haven't heard before. At all. It's all recycled melodies and chord progressions for the most part. Secondly, the guy's voice is really annoying (what a wuss!!), a la Belle and Sebastian (in fact a few of the songs sound a little like B&S songs). Really, this album did NOT excite me in the least and I don't understand what all the hubbub was about. I'm really not trying to be just a contrary jerk, but Jesus Christ I can't believe all the praise this album got. The only thing even slightly interesting is the instrumentation, and truthfully it's not even that interesting to me. My advice, skip it. Maybe try their first one, which I hear is better (but I've never heard it)."
0,"Yes, this band can write some great sounding songs. You just have to get by Colin Meloy's idiotic singing style first. I can't write how annoying it is to listen to him. Either he's trying to be different or is just that stupified in the studio."
0,"I for one am a great fan of family movies but with this one I will make an exception.We've ,im sure at one time or another seen robot movies this is no exception except for the fact its animated and childish. I was not amused by it and you probably will feel the same way. I can see right through its famous line up of movie stars. They've got the voice talents of huge stars like Mel brooks and Robin williams but don't let that leed you away from the fact THAT THE MOVIE SUCKS!!!!!!.The story line is played out and the characters personalites are too. The creators of this also created ICEAGE,which was a good movie but this is just awwwwwwwwwffffffuull.Trust me and at least wait for it to leave theaters to rent it , you'll be happy that you didn't waste any money on this crap-O-rama. I felt confident that creators of iceage would make another hit movie like iceage but this was a total let down.PLEASE MAKE THE NEXT MOVIE YOU MAKE BE A GOOD ONE."
0,"I might like this album better if I didn't already have a fairly large collection of albums by Putamayo World Music which are much better than this! The reason I mention that is that this album reminds of the things that company releases, just not nearly as good.I have both of their other releases which are superb! They are all about Sacred Sex and praise the Lady and the Lord. This album is bland and boring compared to the other two. The only good thing I can really find to say about it is that it might be enjoyable to drum along with it.However, I have several other albums I like better which are also good for drumming along with. If thier next album isn't any better I will have to revise my opinion of Zingaia!"

I listened to it the first week i got it and havent touched it since.The best things about Pennywise is their awesome guitar riffs, loud complex drums, and pure energy, unfortunately this CD has none of those. To see what i mean listen to Land of The Free, About Time, or Full Circle, all A+ class records! Like others have said Jim sounds bored, and the guitars are really dull. Also, they made some great rock songs on LOTF but instead of changing and doing new things like they were with Land of The Free, they recreated their old stuff minus the energy and guitar/drum skills with this record.Bottom line: only a couple decent songs, skip this and get About Time, then Land of The Free, then Full Circle, and see why Pennywise truely rocks!"

0,"What were they thinking? This production was just so bad...it had no charm, no magic, and no spark. To me, The Music Man is a truly mesmerizing stage production. The Preston/Jones cast did an amazing job with it back in the 1960's. This clunker stunk from the first minute to the last. I was so disappointed, and I am certain that you will be too. The singing, dancing, everything was flat. Save your money and re-watch the original."
0,"It's a good production. . . if you've never seen ""The Music Man"" before. However, I imagine that a lot of people who grew up watching and loving the 1962 version will be disappointed, as I was. The characters' personalities and quirks (for example, Mrs. Paroo's accent, Mayor Shinn's speeches, and of course, Harold Hill) never felt over-the-top enough."

0,"Is it a coincidence that the name ""Pride and Fall"" sounds similar to the VNV Nation album title ""Praise the Fallen""? This is one of the worst rip-off bands I have heard thus far in the EBM scene. While most bands in this scene at least attempt to be subtle about their influences, this album is a near cover-version attempt at cashing in on the success of labelmates VNV Nation. And even there they fail... the production and mixing is extremely uneven, the vocals, although clearly trying to mimick Ronan Harris are even weaker that that marginal icon's, and the songs are completely forgettable... only ""Construct"" stands out, and by the time the ho-hum chorus kicks in, even that faulters. Further, when one notices that there are only 7 actual full length songs and that the rest are throwaway 'intro' type tracks, the album becomes even less desirable."
0,"For what these cost I would expect them to be great but the fabric that goes between your toes causes pain and they are also a bit too tight a fit for my regular size that I wear. So, I will be returning these and getting sandals that cause no discomfort between my toes."

0,This album suck ass U2 are hasbeens the group sucks Bono is overrated. Keep away from this album
0,"I simply don't understand this hype concept, you know, Bono's words repeated again and again with any new album. This album is simply awful, showing a big shyness to make whole new music. Rather, this album is safe, weak and boring. Isn't something interesting and worth listen. By far the more interesting thing here is something new after 4 years, but sadly is not 100% at all. This hits factory intended bother me, really. Where is exploration here ? where is excellence here ? where is innovation here ? rather, here I found exasperating evasive music exit for hits and money. U2 have park their car on the safe world of commercial singles, forgetting to communicate what happen in the present world, living in a cloud of fame and pleasure.This album overall is nothing but a terrible mistake fed by desire on more fame and more money. How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb is so boring, predictable, disposable and accessible."
0,"A few good nuggets here,""Vertigo"", ""Yahweh"", ""City Of BlindingLights"", but not much else. U2 has lost most of the ""edge"" they used to have circa '79-'87. Gone is the distinctive cry of the Edge's searing and original guitar work. Also gone is the energy and stomp that used to propel so many of their great songs and albums of that period. Save for a few tunes, this cd limps along and doesn't offer much after four long years of waiting. ""All That You Can't Leave Behind"" was better but also fell short. I'm grateful for the magnificent treasure they have given us, from ""Boy"" to ""The Joshua Tree"", but maybe it's time to start releasing EP's instead of LP's."
0,"Frankly, I found this CD to play like a collection of B-Side tunes: Enjoyable background music consisting of mildly interesting pop-rock sound. However, nothing stands out to define this as an album, and there was a total absence of the melodic singles (including the overrated ""Vertigo"") for which U2 is so well known.Thankfully, Edge does shine through with some very skilled guitar, saving the CD from outright disaster.Highly anticipated, but disappointing effort from my favorite band."
0,"This is just a mindless album. It is a desperate attempt to try to parody earlier recordings. However, after two tracks it starts to blend into one of the worst U2 songs ever - Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own - that just does not seem to be going anywhere. Periodically there are shameless attempts at pop commercial singles. I have never been more let down from a band then I was by the so-called ""U2"" on this one.How could one explain how shallow and meaningless their music became after All That You Can't Leave Behind ? They gave up on art and opted for being ROCK ICONS, a damnable pity if there ever was one.If I were 80s Bono I would be embarrassed to even be associated with the ( now commercialized ) name U2, who unfairly subjected us to this torture they call a ""U2"" record....takes a second to say goodbye say goodbye oh oh oh"
0,"Success guaranted, although this is their worst effort ever.U2 are now no more than a fond memory.We weren't informed about this. Ratter, we were informed about an outstanding collection of songs we didn't find when we had to listen to it. An unhappy commercial move. A ridiculous album, a ridiculous hype. Did they need to do all this ?.We are sending the bill to U2, that's the only thing we can do after being trated as dogs."

0,"Oh, dear, another bomb has been dropped.......I have to agree with the general feeling of being ripped off. Too Christian, too overdubbed, too right to be true is this album. Too many credits, too, for a band which 'returns to their origins'. The names of old haven't compensated for the coming of age of ideas. Now that I'm too old to rock and roll, I'd rather have Coldplay.......fresher and less predictable."

0,"Buy the anthology album that dates up to 1990 because everything these geezers have put out since then sucks. I guess they still sell alot of albums because some people agree with Bonos political views, which is sad because his views are contrived.He gets alot of credit for being a humanitarian.... he lives in Malibu! Bill Gates gives a much bigger percentage of his earnings to charity than Bono does but gets 1/2 as much credit.Keep buying his albums you naive libs."
0,"Nice design, but poorly made (cheap light-weight plastic, molded seams don't fit together). The dawn timing system stopped functioning 2 weeks after the one month return policy deadline! While it still turns on at the selected hour, it does not come on gradually. Instead it comes on abruptly which defeats the entire premise and purpose of being a dawn simulator (to mimic the sun's gradual rise). At this point, I might as well use a light timer for 10$ rather than what I paid for this system!!. Disappointed, and feeling ripped off! As an aside, I had the more expensive ""SunUp - Dawn Simulator"" which I loved but was destroyed in a house fire."
0,PROBABLY THE MOST BORING AND SLUGGISH LIVE CD'S I HAVE EVER HEARD. I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS CD( THIS BAND NORMALLY ROCKS LIVE ) DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS CD. IF YOU GET A LIVE CD FROM THIS BAND GET ONCE AND FOR ALL LIVE. MZA
0,"It was an evening's entertainment. If you like the adventure of violent storm, graphic injury, with an aggressive bear on the chase, it could hold your attention. The story is of a step-mother and teen coming together, with the father actually paying attention to the teen. I see how it is the teen could say her step-mother was a know-it-all. She was a bit too well informed, even in my opinion. The teen does rise to expectation, but the wrap-up scene of a very pregnant mother, with a very revealing neckline was a very unexpected scene. It is not a movie I would choose to watch again, nor recommend to others."

0,"Donald Braben add his voice to a growing chorus of scientists and science policy analysts who believe that a larger share of the scientific research budget should be allocated to high creativity people who are permitted to follow their own personal research agenda. I am also of this opinion, but I cannot get much ammunition for my position from this book. The book does a lot of grumbling, tells many stories, and presents the author's distaste for peer review (I don't agree with him about this). But he has no in-depth case histories, no aggregate statistics, do discussion of what fields are most in need of this treatment, no discussion of how one assess the social value of a ""creative"" science policy, no comparative studies of different systems. In short, there is nothing useful here in support of a cogent policy position on the topic."
0,"There are moment's were I would like Gary Cherone but not very many..... Even Eddie did'nt do it for me on every song and he alway's has before. This record makes me feel sad, very dark album. Where are all the boogie tune's HELP EDWARD!!!!!"
0,"I was keen to hear VH MkIII and wondered how Sammy could ever be topped. After one listen, I didn't think I would ever play it again! Gary Cherone's vocals are very different to Dave or Sammy. It seems they've changed their writing style to accomodate this. And it just doesn't work. Cherone's voice really grates. The album grows on you after a few plays (Tracks 2, 3 and 4 are reasonable), but it is a very ordinary album. VH Mk III is doomed. Swallow your pride and get Sammy back."
0,"What a piece of garbage this is. Of the the 700 CD's I own, this is the absolute worst. Eddie owes me fifteen bucks. I really liked Gary with Extreme, but he was not a real party guy. Van Halen music (when at its best) was always upbeat, have a blast, party music. You could hear the fun the group was having, regardless of what Eddie has said in print about David Lee and Sammy. Eddie is not going to pull a Carlos Santana at this rate. His work has gotten worse and worse since ""1984"", and most of the stuff since David Lee left sounds forced and unrealistic. The early stuff sounded like they didn't have a care in the world - just loved making music. Eddie's read too many of his clippings about being a guitar God. Although Stevie Ray Vaughan died early, he could teach Eddie a thing or two about being dedicated to the music, not his own conceited ego. Eric Clapton this guy will never be. After risking money on this guys last 7 CD's, I will not be suckered again."
0,"I liked this album at first because I really wanted to like it. But upon recent re-listening, I have found that not only is this album a disappointment for VH standards, it's a pretty lousy album by ANY standard. The only songs with any long-lasting appeal are ""Josephina"" and ""Once,"" possibly ""From Afar."" The opening riff to ""Fire In The Hole"" is reminiscent of older VH, but by the time the chorus kicks in it's pretty much downhill. And I don't know WHAT they were thinking releasing ""Without You"" as the first single, when it's probably one of the three worst songs on the album. Everything on this album is lacking, including the production. Overall an utterly boring album."
0,"Oh, mercy me! This is bad...I have been a Van Halen fan for some time but I have to admit that I was a bigger Extreme fan, so I really, really wanted to like this album. The first time I put it in my machine, I was forced to turn it off because I simply could not believe that professional musicians produced such an ill-conceived, poorly executed album, especially with the amount of experience and clout these guys used to hold in their industry. Although some songs have grown on me (though just a little) after I plucked up enough courage to play it again, under no circumstances should a true Van Halen fan ever listen to the last track, 'How many say I', because it will make you cry genuine tears of shame..."
0,"CD came in great shape and was a real value. I was curious about this CD that was described as a train-wreck. It is far from anything that VH has done in the past. The music is OK, but know that it is not a rockin' VH album."
0,"it's been well over a year since I bought this thing. tried again to listen, but sorry, it still [is bad]. this is the worst van halen album, and the future looks mighty dim. to all of those who reviewed this, and liked it, i say ""I don't understand."" there is almost nothing good here. the lyrics are bombastic. must have spent a lot of time with a thesarus. obviously, the band must realize this because they played atlantic city last year. is vegas next? ted templeman help!!!!! vh's best albums are those with ted at the helm. maybe he can straighten this mess out. otherwise, bye bye warner bros, and hello k-tel records. july 1999 and i still can not believe how bad this cd was and still is. maybe i'll try hanging it from my rear view mirror. maybe that will improve it. or maybe i'll nuke it. lead guitarist disease. red voodoo rocks. buy that instead."
0,"I have listened to this piece of Sh!# CD many times trying to understand what the FU*! Gary is doing in this band in the first place.The defining sounds of Van Halen have been silenced by a weak and shallow singer. Gary is not (and never will be), VH quality and should never have been considered for the position.The previous two singers, Sammy and David Lee have both moved on (and up), showing that the real power in the vocals for Van Halen came from these two great singers.It doesn't really matter who the singer is but, it does matter that the singer is as powerful as the music that Van Halen is capable of. Gary falls way short of this requirement and I feel sorry for the rest of the band."
0,"It is sad that the band is trying to sound like Van Hagar, but the words are not there. The sound is not there. I will miss VH."
0,"I am a huge VH fan, and I bough this album the second it came out. In fact, I knew the store owner and he sold it to me a couple of days early (back in 96 when this was released).Gary Cherone is one incredible singer, and could have possibly taken over the slot better had there not been such a drastic foray down this stylized-rock-alternative type of sound.No Van Halen album sounds like the other. Since VH's debut, the albums got more refined and developed over time. The epitome of the Roth era can be found in Fair Warner, while with Sammy on vocals, I feel Balance is the most balanced album, with 4-Unlawful coming a close second.This album sucks if you are a typical VH fan. Independantly each member is strong, but as a whole do not jel. To think I wasted $34 when this came out, because I also bought the limited edition tin case import version in addition to the regular.How Many Say I? none."
0,"Let's start off by saying I liked both the Dave and Sammy incarnations of the band. So I'm not just whining that nobody could ever replace Diamond Dave. I actually liked Cherone's singing with Extreme. On this, he's straining so hard it sounds like he's going to pop a blood vessel. The songs are terrible as well. Awful production doesn't help things any, and the trademark VH backing vocals are curiously absent. This is Eddie's least impressive guitar work by a wide margin. The best song on here (whatever that might be-they blow pretty much uniformly) wouldn't make the cut on any other Van Halen album. All in all, a colossal disappointment. I have every VH album, but I've already gotten rid of this one. Don't say we didn't warn you!"
0,"This album has some great rhythms on it which is the true Eddie Van Halen comming out. Somewhere along the line, Ed starting feeling that he has to put a ""mind blowing"" solo in each song. Ed's solo's on this album are very intricate sounding but do nothing for the song and/or for the listener. What ever happened to the ""if it sounds good, then it is good"" way of thinking? I guess this is what happens when guitar players start producing their own albums. Bands need someone to tell them when a song is crap and when a song is good enough to go on an album. Most of these songs are crap. The fans want and deserve more Ed,come on, come over to this side for the big win. Sammy and Dave are laughing at you!!!!!!"
0,"Oh my god this is a horrible album. I remember when I heard the first VH album, and the first time I heard 5150; and believe me, I won't be able to forget this album after years of therapy. Give me the DLR Band or the Red Rocker anyday to this crap. I can't believe this album was even released it's that bad. The downward spiral of VH didn't begin with this album, but I don't see how it can get worse. Come on Ed, I'm over thirty with two kids but I still ROCK. What the hell happened to you? Come back Ed....just repeat after me, there's no place like Rock, there's no place like Rock..."
0,I think Ed is trying to make Van Halen into something it shouldn't be. I hope the next album will be a 100% improvement. Without You is pretty good- but I wish there were more rock tunes on this album. This isn't really a rock album if you thought it was.
0,This is horrible...i am a huge VH fan and i hope they bring back the real force behind this group .. DAVID LEE ROTH!!!!!! If you like real VH then i suggest you pass on this one.
0,"I am not a Van Halen fan, but I received this album four years ago as a gift, and I still own it this day for two reasons. 1) No CD Recyclery will buy it from me for their shelves are already full of them, nor will any self-respaecting person take it from me (I even put it on my front lawn for a few days, but not even the west wind cared to pick it up). 2) It is a collection without any redeeming qualities, a feat even the lowliest pop band cannot achieve. From it's bland vocals ala Gary Cherone, to it's hard to follow licks to it's toxic-smelling liner notes, this album takes the cake fopr worst of the nineties."
0,Eddie needs to swallow his pride and ask Sammy to do him a favor and make VanHalen a band again. I tried to enjoy VH3. I tried to pass it off as one of those rare albums that has a deeper meaning that takes time to appreciate. The album is a waste of time and money. Sammy...why don't you ask Sammy?
0,"It's not o typical Van Halen album. After one year listening to it, I must say I didn't like it. Hope Sammy or D. Coverdale helps Van Halen return to the great days. I just think if Coverdale enter in Van Halen, the band had to change the name, maybe to Coverdale - Van Halen, because Van Halen is gone without Sammy or Dave. It's part of history of music."
0,Alright guys some songs are OK but thats all I'm giving them. Eddie plays some good solos but it's not like we didn't hear the same ones on Balance. David gets kicked out again so what does Eddie do he sings himself a little ditty. It's not happenin. We miss ya Dave.
0,"How many people would like to go up to Eddie and just kick him in his balls for this one? Please tell me folks.....what was Eddie thinking? He he that delusional to think that he could still achieive icon sucess without Dave or Sam?We all love you Ed, but damn this was god awful my friend"
0,"Wow, what a letdown. Being a VH fan for the last 20 years, I was very disappointed with VH III. The bottomline in my mind is that Eddie has very bad taste when it comes to judging talent. I remember when he produced a band called Private Life in the 80's. Boy were they bad. DLRoth had always stated that when he first met the VH brothers they were covering the Who's Live at Leeds and Clapton. Impressive musically, but not much showbiz sex appeal. That's what DLR brought to the band, and what the band misses sorely now - a good sense of humor. Unless you are really into guitar albums (like Vai, Satriani or Malmsteen), stay away from this album. It's nothing like the classic VH sound."
0,"...the agony of reading this book, it will be worth taking the time--although not the price I paid. Zeidner's prose is uninspiring at its best, and borders on the pretentious at its worst. The main character, Claire, starts off interestingly enough, but quickly becomes whiny and entirely too fascinated with her own naval, so to speak. The 'plot' is prototypical--don't be fooled by the fact that Claire is a mathematician--Zeidner gets no more original than that. Women readers may be offended, especially those who have lost a child, by Zeidner's completely inept portrayl of a grieving mother--why Claire would view this event (and four years after the fact, at that!) as reason to go to bed with everything in sight boggles the mind. Zeidner has written a particularly awful scene involving over-40 sex in a backyard--again, very original. In all, the first 30 pages or so aren't too bad, but everything after that is down hill. Disappointing at best."
0,"The only reason I did not give this book one star is because the beginning of it was very well-written. Had the tone and pacing remained the same, it could have been great. However, the middle and end of the book were atrocious! The author was attempting to wax philosophic in a gritty, detatched voice, but merely succeeded in writing a story completely devoid of plot or purpose. I agree with the reviewer who said that mothers who had lost a child would find this book insulting. Yes, everyone deals with loss in different ways, but bedding a teenager AND his father as a means to heal the pain is just disturbing. I kept hoping there was a padded room and a straight jacket waiting for her at the end of the book. I would have been satisfied if she'd ended up with a prescription for Xanax; after reading this book I feel like I need one!"

0,"Old and Boring. 'nuff said.We really enjoyed the first four collections, but this one felt like Warner was intentionally trying to rip off consumers. They could have tried to include a few funny ones on discs 3 and 4. The first two discs were just kinda funny, but, for the price, not worth our time. Next time I'll believe other negative reviews and pass, if I see the word old or boring."
0,"Mr Mitcham omits facts and misleads his readers.One example is the number of soldiers in a Russian Division in 1944 and their quality. Crumbling Empire is almost a carbon copy of the title put out by former Nazi's who assert that they would have won except the Russians out-numbered us and we had Hitler. To Simplistic and biased. The author is not a Nazi, but a serious Russian Hater, ""The Reds"". Mr Mitcham says that a large number of German POWs were were turned over to the Partisans and put to death in horrible ways. Paul Adair says something of the same thing except he says it was German officers who said this. There is no mention of the Germam Army's complicity in millions of deaths of Jews, Russian POWs, alledged partisans, men women & children, deliberately murdered directly in the case of the Jews and indirectly buy the German Army stealing their food, and putting them out of their houses in the dead of Winter. Misleading,and Biased, not good history"
0,"We were excited for this newest Veggie Tales movie because it's geared toward girls. We've really enjoyed ""The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything"" and had similar expectations for ""Princess and the Pop Star."" Unfortunately, the story just wasn't very cohesive -- they really tried to fit too much into a short time -- and the ending in particular left something to be desired with one girl (named Princess) failing to realize the error of her ways until her little brother found his wee vegetable self in a perilous situation that she rescued him from. The jokes weren't there, the religious subtext was overly preachy, and the songs weren't as catchy as those in Pirates. Even my little girl didn't care for this video."
0,"My son received this as a Christmas gift last year. It was fun while it was working, which was 2 days. It makes a bunch of noise but doesn't move an inch. I replaced all the batteries and still the same result. This toy is probably the worst built toy I have ever encountered."
0,"This was a Christmas gift for our 18 month old son and we were excited about it. As other reviews have stated, there was no battery for the remote included, so we couldn't use it until we went out and purchased one. It worked great for a few hours, then the car barely moved forward or back and didn't spin anymore. We changed out all the batteries with no success. It didn't suffer any damage - no dropping or crashing, so we are at a loss as to what happened. It's a bummer because despite being annoyingly loud (we postage taped a folded tissue to the speaker which greatly helped with the noise) our son and 3 year old daughter really enjoyed playing with this toy. From previous reviews, I'm guessing that contacting Battat will be to no avail."
0,I bought this at Target for my son. The package said it had won an award and it seemed like a great idea. But it just doesn't work. I put fresh batteries in the car and remote. The car made a lot of noise but only moved when I touched the remote antenna to that of the car. What a waste! I returned it the next day.
0,"I purchased this manual with the assumption that it could be used a reference book concerning Project Management related issues. Unfortunately, I find that I have no need for this book. It would be better suited for people, who don't know anything about project management, and need to survive for a short period of time. It does not contain any more useful information that common sense would dictate.I thought that the accompanying computer disc containing sample templates would prove to be this manual's redeeming feature. Again, nothing more than what common sense would dictate.One thing that I had hoped for was that this guide would dovetail the Project Management Institute's Knowledge Area. I found that the Project Manager's Desk Reference does a much better job."

After an initial glance through, I thought, yes, can't wait to read this. however, after a brief period it proved to be very disappointing, despite all the hype. My feeling was that I could have gleaned as much information by downloading a few tutorials on the net (and then some). When I buy a book, I want something more than these freely downloadable tutorials. If I could have been bothered, I should have sent the book back for a refund. Just my personal opinion!"

0,"This CD has a very poor quality sound (even on my nice surround sound system) and I later found on the back BMG music, so it was purchased through there instead of a better qaulity music dealer.I also ordered it on-line to specifically purchase this CD without the Explicit lyrics, but this CD does contain explicit lyrics, even though it is not stated on the cover of the CD.I e-mailed the seller back about my disappointment, but never received a reply."

0,"Although the author claims this book is for beginners, only an expert could benefit from it. The author simply had someone photograph while he carved and burned a single duck, then labeled the pictures. No background, explanation, or discussions were given. A more desciptive title, emphasizing an expert interested only in ducks, would be very helpful to the reader."
0,"I usually enjoy Jude Deveraux's books, but this one lacked something, or several somethings. Passion, for one-- Michael is an endearing character in some ways, but his love for Emily's pure soul is not the stuff of romantic fiction. Emily comes across as a bit of a twit, and the novel's climax is nothing short of ridiculous. Emily is jeaporadized by a poorly thought out and unintentionally hilarious ""evil"" so thinly plotted it is obviously nothing more than the barest excuse for having this angel come to earth. Skip it."
0,This book was very boring and I read a couple of books inbetween this one. Had a very hard time finishing it. It was almost as if it had been written by someone other than Jude Deveraux.
0,"My question isn't, ""What's happened to Ms. Deveraux?"", it's ""What's happened to her editor?"" She's one of my all-time favorite authors, but reading her last few books has been like watching a train wreck you were powerless to prevent. The ideas are there; the stories have the potential for magic, but apparently her publisher has decided that once you reach a certain level of success, you no longer need editing. (Judith McNaught seems to be suffering from the same syndrome.) Please editors, help restore the voices of these once fabulous authors!"
0,"It seems as though there are two Jude Deveraux's. There is one who writes really good books like ""Knight in Shining Armor"" and one who writes real nonsense like ""An Angel for Emily"". Let us hope that the one who writes well returns soon, for this book is just plain silly. It has no continuity. Sentences don't make sense and there is no follow through of ideas. I have enjoyed many of Deveraux's books-but this is not one of them."
0,"In the prelude/introduction, the author states herself that she made the system up. It's not authentic by any stretch of the word.

The thirty or so people that gave this book five stars must all be friends of the author. Look for it at the library,.. that's where I got rid of my copy."

0,"I suspect the ""2700 mAh"" rating on these batteries. I've been using these now in identical LED lamps (with similar usage patterns) and other batteries with lower mAh ratings outlast them. Older batteries."
0,"I have had 3 sets of Powerex rechargeable AA batteries and all have lasted less than a year. While they hold a high level of charge (and last long in my cameras) at first, within 6-9 months of occasional use the time they could hold their charge got shorter and shorter. (I'm using a LaCrosse BC-900 charger, reputably one of the best -and kindest to batteries- on the market)I have converted to Sanyo eneloop batteries, which work much better: they hold their charge longer, even after 18 months of regular use... and they hold their rated voltage longer through use so you get the full benefit of every charge. Don't let generally lower mAh rating fool you (they usually are rated 2000 mAh compared to 2700 for the Powerex), they give you a much more useable charge, over a much longer life."
0,"I switched to NiMH a few years ago with PowerEx 2300 MAH batteries. Loved them. Since then I have tried Energizer, Duracell, and Rayovac ""Hybrid"" - no problems. But PowerEx was still special to me because it was my first, so I upgraded to a set of their 2700 MAH AA's (directly from Thomas Distributing). Worst batteries I've ever owned. They discharge the fastest of all my NiMH, with or without use. I stopped using the 2700's in less than a year (while my original 2300's are still going strong). Personally I think there is at least one defective battery amongst them that screws up the entire set, but I didn't feel I could prove that for a refund (in hindsight, I should have tried). Will never go back to PowerEx."

0,Bought this for son when he turned 1 year. He was able able to push the button by 1.5 but the steering does not work. We have taken it apart and put it back together thinking that may be the problem and even put oil on the moving parts. It just doesn't seem to turn well. The mechanism for the steering is flimsy at best -a rod with a hook on the end and its quite frustrating for our little boy. It also gets stuck easy in grass which is frustrating for all. I would just wait till they can drive a bigger version. We are looking at purchasing a 12V vehicle now at age 2.
0,"We bought this toy for our 1 1/2 year old. He didn't get much used out of it before it tore up. It is very small and has hardly any legroom. The wheels do not keep traction on grass so I spent most of the time pushing him. It was fun while it lasted, but anytime my son had other options of something to ride (such as his friends small jeep) he would race for something else. The steering is not the easiest to turn either... a bit easier than a circular steering wheel, but still not easy for a 1 1/2-2y/o."
0,"I would give this really a 1.5 star, but I was generous. It is way too sweet. Others have said the same in their reviews, but I ignored them to my chagrin. It is very very thin and has a texture and appearance like it has been reconstituted and highly processed. Because it is so thin, there are never any big lumps of gristle, but sometimes you can tell the meat quality as a bit off in some pieces. The worst problem is the overly sweet flavor, the second problem is the texture and meat quality. This is not a very good jerky. Their Buffalo, while also too sweet, is much better as is their Turkey. They are much much less expensive than a really premium jerky like those from Mountain America, so it is a toss up. For the price, I may re-order the Turkey and perhaps Buffalo, but I will never order this Beef again."
0,"Purchased this for my 5 year old son so he would stop with the couch. The frame warps if you step on the side so it isn't level and flat and results in an unsafe surface to jump on. Also, one of the legs won't stay screwed. I think the leg is stripped and it came that way. I am now past the return policy so I can't return it.I do like the jumping surface and the fact that it is springless. If it weren't for the frame issue I would have given 4 stars."
0,You need three men to put this item together. There is no way u can do it with less than that. After a couple of uses it looks like its falling apart!
0,Perhaps I got a defective product but I ended up in the emergency room trying to set up this trampoline. We followed instructions and were very careful but after putting the main pieces together and wrestling the two sides down flat - it sprang up and hit me in the face with a lot of force causing a laceration on my face and a lot of bruising. The instructions do not indicate that this is a possibility. No product this dangerous should require assembly. Be Careful.
0,"The instructions for this product actually call for THREE people to put it together. My boyfriend and I managed to do it with two, after about 45 minutes and a great fear of losing our eyes. If you do buy this (which I do not recommend), put it together on a carpeted area, that seemed to help us. I will NEVER take it apart for storage - first, because I'm scared, and second, because it will take days to put it back together. Also, at one of the places where it had been welded, it is rusting AND one of the legs was too big to screw onto it's peg. Oh - and there is an unadvertised weight limit of 200lbs - so you can only use this if you just sort of need it, not if you really need it."
0,Unless you have at least three people to help you put this thing together .... you aren't going to. I bought it as a Christmas present for my daughter. Unfortunately I have a disability in one arm and between my daughter and I we are unable to put this thing together. For others it might not be a problem but for us it is very frustrating. We have no strong male family members to rely on and no friends who are able to come over and help us out. The delivery was super fast and I do appreciate that part of it... but I truly cannot say what it is like to use this product. Perhaps they should consider making it easier to put together ... or maybe let people purchase it already assembled.
0,I am very dissapointed in this product. The last one I bought I purchased from Sears and this one is a mess. My 3 boys are thin and jump on this on the inside and it not even usuable. The washers have fallen out and it falls apart easily!! Not a happy camper!!
0,The frame bent and cover ripped within one week of opening. My kids are 5 and 7 and rarely break anything. I'd go with a better product and I may try to return this one...
0,I am very angry with myself that I didn't read the warnings.....this is too difficult for me to put together.....hence worthless/useless ..However the people selling this should have clearly stated that it needs a lot of work to assemble .......N~
0,"This product is garbage! My husband spent hours trying to put it together, and he is a very handy guy. He has worked in the construction industry and can usually put things together without instructions. He was ready to throw this trampoline right in the garbage! He said that even if he could get it together, he would never let our kids play on it. It's that bad!!!"
0,"When I read other reviews that said it was dangerous to assemble, I just thought maybe they weren't doing it correctly. Be forewarned, until you put the bolts/screw in (which we didn't receive), the trampoline CAN snap shut with FORCE. My husband was injured. Having three adults is the best safety precaution, just make sure they are all in place before the final stretching into place of the trampoline. One strong adult can push the trampoline into place, while two others can hold it down to make sure their half does not snap back while the bolts/screws are being put in. I wouldn't have attempted this in the first place if I knew the potential for injury. It's just not worth it."
0,"This was a Christmas purchase for my active toddler, so the weight on it is about forty pounds. The construction is such that the legs are inclined to move inward, from the pressure of completed assembly maybe? To ignore the legs moving inward would ultimately result in one of them getting tucked inward, eventually breaking, and well, you try hopping on something that has one less support leg. If there were more weight on it the situation would be ore severe. Would not purchase again, would recommend you not to purchase at all"
0,"This trampoline is VERY dangerous to put together. It snapped shut several times while I was trying to assemble it. After finally getting it together the holes where the screws go didn't even line up!! It works fine after you get it together, but the worst trampoline ever to put together!!!"
0,"Very inconvenient to assemble. No way one person can do it. This item comes as a kit, not together like other mini trampolines on market. I would not recommend this for use."
0,"There are so many problems with this item it is difficult to know where to begin but to warn other potential buyers I'll go down the list of why you should avoid this item.The knobby spikes for teeth cleaning are sharp and caused my dogs gums/tongue to bleed!It is slighly flavored - and the dog loved that - but it encourages chewing on a product that comes apart in big chunks that my dog swallowed before I could get him to spit it out. It's chewy and flavored but breaks off easily which brings the final point...It lasted all of maybe 30 minutes. At the end of that time period my dog had bleedig gums and tongue (I stopped playing with him immediately) and while my back was turned, grabbed the tug toy off the table to chew which immediately resulted in a big chunk coming off in his mouth that he promptly swallowed. Hopefully he will be okay but now we are left ""keeping an eye"" for things to ""pass"".Save a trip to the vet and avoid this awful product!"
0,"If you want to read a terrific tale of faerie unleased on a modern world, read War for the Oaks by Emma Bull. Raymond Feist has another option, but I've forgotten the title. This book is a huge disappointment. I bought it based on a student's recommendation and was heartily dismayed at its sophomoric style and content."
0,"Neil Gaiman brought European folklore stateside in American Gods, and it worked. But Seelie and Unseelie Courts in New Jersey!?!?! What?!Garden State it may be but Tir na NÃ“g it is not. And besides, North America has it's own nature spirit traditions. Why do all fairies need to be Gaelic?Leaving aside my other issues with this book (which I am far too lazy to go into,) as far as I'm concerned, if you're going to make a story about Celtic fairies, you really ought to base the story in Ireland or the UK. And if you STILL want to base it in North America you should at least give the reader an explanation as to why they are there!"
0,"Though the book is intriguing in itself, I found myself let down on many occasions within this book. The plot line is actually rather depressing, and if you're not an emo hate-my-life distraught teenager, than i think all you'll get from this book is a bad memory.Though the author writes this beautifully, with great voice and nice prose, the plot lacked anything to make it engaging and I found that i was forcing myself to finish it just so i could get it over with and done. The characters are thin, with bad personalities, and even the vivid and embellished settings don't make up for worst thing about this book. A lack of grandness.In the end, though the plot is resolved, i felt like saying, ""Great job everyone, but everything that you did was done within an area of about one square mile, and even then it was kind of cheesy and weak. I bet that there's something even worse just in the next square mile.""It just let me down."
0,"I love Faery Folklore and I expected so much more from this book. I am disappointed with the characters. They are dull, shallow and mundane. I couldn't connect with any of them. Kaye, the main character is supposed to be special, but nothing in her character is special. In the end she's a hero but she's not heroic. It's about a trashy disfunctional group of people, drinking, smoking and to be completely honest, disturbing. I also felt lost many times as to what was going on, thinking I might have missed something but it was just badly explained. The author has a great imagination but I think it could have been so much better.I was really shocked to find out also that this is a book for young adults. I don't think it carries any good message to the youth and I think it makes it sound like doing stupid things is cool."
0,"Being an avid reader of fantasy, this novel was very lacking. The plot was good, but the style of writing could have come from an eitgh-grader. What was missing was better writing skills, which discreetly completes a book. If you have ever read an anime novel, this is very much like it. Not good quality whatsoever. I suggest Eragon, or The City of Ember."
0,"As is stands today, it is almost exactly DOUBLE the price to buy the set, than to buy the individual volumes separately. Every now and then this set comes down to a reasonable price, but it seems that every time I look at it in my wish list, the price has changed. One day it's $300, then it's $190, then it's $240, etc etc etc. What gives?"

0,"I'm not a jerky connoisseur (and can't afford to be). I think the Golden Valley peppered beef jerky strikes a good balance of quality and value. The product looks, smells, and tastes pretty much like beef with some black pepper added to it. No MSG, no artificial flavors. Hours after you've eaten it, you won't feel like something is polluting you. The package has only a small amount of crumbs and small fragments, so it's finger food all the way to the bottom of the bag, not fingers-in-your-mouth food.UPDATE: After a long period of subscribing to the Golden Valley Original 16-ounce packages, I've given up. The quality declined gradually, with pieces becoming smaller and tougher with not much flavor. But the final blow was a sudden decrease to a 12-ounce package -- at the same price. I'll have to find something else."
0,"hard to explain why this was so gross, the texture of it was like it had a sticky film of tripe or something on it. tasted ok but felt icky in my mouth . it also wasnt the best smelling jerky either. alot of the peices had really rough texture like there was still cartilige in it or something -and you literally could not chew it. some peices were better than others within the same package, but compared to most others beef jerky ive had, ill only give it one star."
0,"I'm hoping that the replacement will be better.The screws that came with the unit were too long and it was extremely difficult to attach the legs. I have had the unit for approx one month and now the legs are loose and wobble. I called this morning for a replacement.The unit dries our towels sufficiently, so I'm hoping the new one will be better."
0,"I was very disappointed with the Warm Rails. The only thing that was warm was the 1 inch space of the towel on the top of the rail. I left it warming overnight, no improvement. I would not recomend this product to anyone who desires warm towels."
0,"I bought this towel warmer as a gift for my husband and was horribly disappointed with it as was he. The bar got very warm while the towel stayed nice and cool. We even tried the suggestions of putting several towels on it at a time, this too failed. This product may be okay if you're looking for a drying rack but don't be fooled in to thinking that it will warm your towels."
0,"I agree that this is not a great towel warmer. It may suffice as a sweater or delicate clothes dry rack, but fails miserably with towels. You'd be better off to stick your towel in the clothes dryer for a couple of minutes to get it completely toasty. Also I found the same model at Bed, Bath & Beyond at $5 cheaper than Amazon...Merry Christmas"
0,If you're trying to find the origin of various religious practices and differences this is not the book. Green assumes that reader knows what various terms are and often I did not (and I'm studying to be a Baptist Preacher). Why does the Catholic Bible have extra books from the protestant? Couldn't find it in here. How did the Baptists rise to dominance in the U.S.? Who knows? It's not here. The text is dry and unenlightening. I believe there are many better books for the uninitiated and even the fairly well initiated.
0,"I am rating the physical, not intellectual, qualities of this book. To call this a hardback shows how that term has lost much of its meaning over the years. A hardback used to connote a cloth cover over stout cardboard, embossed with lettering, covered with a dust jacket. The pages would be composed of acid-free paper sewn together. The print would be high contrast. This dictionary has none of these qualities. The vinyl(?) blue cover of the copy I received was already peeling from the cardboard at a corner. The cover shows many scratches. The pages are glued, not sewn. The print looks more like xerox than high (or even regular) quality. There was no mention of acid-free paper on the copyright page. This dictionary should be fine for temporary, not long-term use. I remember the high quality Cassell's hardback dictionary I owned decades ago. I wish now that I still had it."
0,"As a well-educated rock music,especially emo-punk,person,I was sickened every time i tried to listen to this CD all the way through.Why? It's definitely one of the less-than-great emo albums ever (not completely horrible,though)and the fact that this band is led by a singer who shouldn't be bragging about his ""musical genius"" when he should first realize how disgusting his voice sounds compared to most other emo singers,isn't sweetening the deal.When i bought this album,it had a sticker on it that read:""If you like Taking Back Sunday,Brand New and The Used,you'll love Matchbook Romance!""I should have known how desperate they were when i read that.But more disturbing is the fact that they dared compared themselves to Taking Back Sunday? TBS is actually an emo band that doesn't sound recicled.And Brand New?Have they heard Deja Entendu?That album is not only the best emo album,but definitely one of the best albums of all time-in any genre."
0,"I've been a software engineer for 20+ years. This is the worst technical book that I can recall.

To make it worse, some of the terms are never clearly explained even when you get to that section of the book."

0,"I'm not a musical genious at figuring out what works for the masses, but I know what works for me. This CD does not! My 1st venture into Spineshank was The Height of Callousness, which I really liked. This CD has very little originality to it, and most of the songs IMHO sound alike in too many ways. I'm not a total prude mind you, but saying the F word, just to say it ruins the context of emotion and angst. I'm not giving up on Spineshank just yet, but Self-Destructive Pattern really turned out true to form for me.. its gonna sit where it is for a long time!"

0,"This is a flimsily built CD player that sounds weak. It lacks the dynamics that a quality player puts out, especially with the included headphones. With more efficient headphones, the sound is a bit louder, but still lacks any punch or excitement. To make things worse, this unit does not have AUDIO OUTPUT, so you can't even connect to a heftier power source. If you don't care about quality audio, this one may be for you since it is cheap. But if you do care, get a better one."
0,"I purchased a Warmrails and just installed it in the bathroom I just remodeled. I used it for 3 days and LOVED it until I started noticing yellow ""stains"" on my towels. I took down a large bathsheet I had on the top rack and found brown scorch marks - the towel smelled like cotton does when you leave an iron on it and scorch it. I don't know if I have a defective model, I purchased it on Amazon, and will be contacting the company. I would absolutely replace it if it turns out to be a defective unit and not a ""feature"" of the product."
0,"I installed 2 of those shelves in my bathrooms. The polished brass looks very good. It work relatlively well as a towel warmer. However, it does not dry towels very well. This is more a practical issue. A shelf is very good to place already dry towels to be warmed, but it is a bad design to places towels to dry. For me, now it is too late, but if you want your towels not only warm, but also dry, I would recomend you to buy one of the stand up models instead. Those should work fine."
0,"It is always amusing for me to come across yet another attempt at 'Rewriting Koresh History'. The author conveniently overlooks THE FACT that David Koresh used women and innocent children as 'Human Shields' from the proper authorities. He also neglects to mention that keeping children locked up for 51 days without any decent food, running water , heat or electricity was CHILD ABUSE on a Grand Scale.I also thought his profile of Marc Breault was most misleading when Mr. Beault accomplished more in saving Koresh's followers than anybody else involved in this scenario. I do believe that this book should be sold in the 'Fiction 'section of any bookstore."

The one good feature is the camera which is pretty standard nowadays. Save yourself a whole bunch of money and DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!"
0,"This ""almost a novel"" is Arbatova's weakest book so far. I would recommend her autobiographical prose and plays instead.

All this said, it is beautifully written in places."
0,"I've never written a review. But if I can save anyone else from wasting their time and money, I'll try. This is quite possibly the worst documentary I've ever tried to watch.

I don't have the words to describe how utterly devoid of actual information this video is, other than stating it's only quality was in getting me to write a review hoping to spare some other victim wasting their money and time on it."
0,"Brad Thor is not up to the paar of Vince Flynn and some of the other authors in this genre. Although the topic and theme of the novel is of the sort that intrigues, the execution is weak, and the story line falls short of the believable. His descriptions of locations and settings are well-done, but they should be only adding texture to a plot. Instead, they are the most easily read portions, and the plot and story line wanders. The dialogue is often cute, and seems to be auditioning for a screen play rather than that which is expected from the players such as these in real life."
0,"Beware of the evil Fox and Geese game in this one. They should not have made this so impossible to win, because you cannot move on in the game until you win it. It is a PAIN. It took me days until I finally got lucky and won. Overall, the game besides this one irritation is good. It's fun to play chef, the story line is interesting, and I do get a kick out of Nancy's random mumblings in the bathroom. But if you're aiming to buy this game and finish it in one sitting, pfft, good luck trying. That one mini game will not be defeated so easily."
0,These games are very hard to play and figure out. Most of them you almost have to cheat to finish them. Just like on one of them you have to set you alarm clock to a specific time to catch a late night clue.
0,The only good thing about the book is that it made a good stabilizer (the perfect width to keep my table sturdy.) The book is obviously written for those self-righteous beings who have decided to have a 'one-week-long-wild-side'. Masello is obviously a rookie to the scene and is looking to score a quick buck on the new 'occult is cool' market. Poor work on such a fascinating and powerful subject.
0,"After about a little less than a year of use, the saw will not hold a charge any longer. It was never very powerful to begin with but total malfunction after less than a year is not what one expects from B & D. Go back to the workshop B & D and work on your batteries!"
0,"I am happy with other Black & Decker cordless tools I have purchased through Amazon.com (and I love Amazon.com), so I ordered this cordless saw. Unfortunately, this saw would run for only a very short period of time (10 minutes?) -- and took hours to re-charge. I ended up sending it back and buying (again, from my favorite online store - Amazon.com) a saw with a cord -- the Bosch Model 1640VS ""Finecut"" saw. It was much more expensive, and for some folks it might not be as useful as a cordless reciprocating saw, and the blades are not cheap -- but I am hopeful the Bosch will take care of my needs."

0,"I'm SO not impressed with this product. I read all the RAVE reviews and that's why I purchased this thinking it would help my baby take a bottle. WRONG. WRONG. WRONG. The bottles always leaked. My 3mo old hated it and it was a waste of money. I ended up buying the ""SOOTHIES"" bottle at Walmart & it's also made by The First Years. It cost me 3 bucks and she loves it. She has NO ""nipple confusion"". I'm still only breast feeding and my sitter says she doesn't have a problem with my baby taking the bottle."
0,"I am a mother of twins (2.5 weeks) and was recommended these bottles by our lactation consultant to promote breastfeeding and bottle feeding. These are horrible. First, as others have already written, they leak. They leak at the nipple area as well as the rim and I triple checked to ensure we were following directions appropriately. More of your breast milk ends up on your babies neck then in their mouth.Second, the last 1/2 oz of milk gets wasted due to poor bottle design.Third, our twin babies have more gassiness with these bottles than others. Save your money and time and skip this product. I am returning the bottles because they do not meet their label claims."

0,"I read this very detailed account of Michael Jordan's two years spend with the Washington Wizards and wanted to appreciate the author's lengthy tome. However, I find it just a bit interesting that if Jordan scores forty or fifty points in a game, it merits maybe half a sentence... but when Jordan scores two points or ten points, the author rambles on for several pages. This perhaps reveals much more about the author than it does about Jordan.Unfortunately, this is just not a balanced account of the two year period. The author only seems to have interviewed people who had a negative impression of both Jordan-the man AND Jordan-the athlete... and ultimately, this leaves a bad taste in the mouth.The author seems very much to have an axe to grind, and his efforts at propaganda reveal the same shallowness inside that he accuses in Jordan.Disappointing. I very much wanted to like it."

However, our son hates these nipples. They are too flat and frustrated him, we had to buy another product and as he is 6 months old he still doesn't like them. We've tried a few times. There just doesn't leave much room for a natural suction as it's totally flat with a nipple sticking straight out. Also, there is no way to get rid of air in the bottle or to ensure your baby doesn't get air while eating. I wouldn't recommend this system to anyone, I don't know how babies eat out of these. The nipples make no natural sense and there are no other solution to a replacement as far as I have seen."

I bought 4 paddles. 3 of them are great. The 4th had a big flap of paddle rubber peeling back when I opened it. I glued it back and now it seems fine.

1,"I purchased this because I have been eating popcorn daily, popped in a microwave popper by Nordicware.Compared to the microwave popper, this air popper made chewy/cardboard like popcorn. Not the fluffy, crunchy popcorn that the Nordicware makes (even without adding any oil or anything to the popcorn in either machine). The reason I tried the air popper was because it can make more popcorn at once.I will be returning the air popper, and will continue to use the Nordicware microwave popper."
1,"For $15 to $20, it's hard to be too picky. But now on our fifth of these, there is a clear pattern of the fan weakening over time. When it occurs, the air flow is not strong enough to push to kernals out of the way during heating, thus trapping the hot air underneath the pile of kernals in the chamber.If you purchase one, watch the beginning of the heating sequence carefully, especially when these get 6-12 months old."
1,After two months Poof it died in a puff of smoke. When it did work Kernels flew all over the room. Popped corn filled the bowl and my counter what a mess.I want my money back
1,"This is awful. There is no way to keep the popcorn from going all over the room. I had it as far back on the counter top as possible, but it still goes all over the floor. The kernels are hot, so be careful. I gave it away....with a warning. Very noisy too."
1,To be fair I use this popper almost daily. The first one lasted about 6 months before the motor burnt out. I just replaced it last month and the motor burnt out already after 2 weeks of use. That is ridiculous! I will now purchase another brand.
1,"This electric sharpener nearly ruined my good knives. I followed the directions very carefully and after trying several times to get a good edge on my knives, realized that it was actually harming the blades rather than sharpening them. I took it and the knives to a professional for sharpening. We found that it had blunted the edges because one of its grinding stones was misshapen and out of alignment and could not be fixed. Fortunately, my knives could be saved.This is a really cheap sharpening instrument and you don't know if you're going to get one that's been properly constructed or not. My advice is that is you value your knives and want an electric sharpener, pay up and get a really good one, or do as I do. I am now back to having my knives professionally sharpened and keeping the edge with a ceramic 'steel' in between. Since I didn't want a replacement, I tossed this one. Regained some cupboard space and learned my lesson."
1,"Maybe I'm doing this wrong, but I haven't really been able to produce a really nice fine sharp knife since I got this thing. It does sharpen the knifes a little bit, but I'm thinking about taking the cover off so I can better angle the knife to get more gusto out of it. If I do, I'll update this review with results."
1,Bought this product and sending it back the same day. It failed to sharpen any of my knives no matter how much time was spent using the device. The motor was so weak that it would stop under the weight of a chef's knife without and downward pressure.
1,I already had another knife sharpener but it is hard to keep the blade at the correct cutting angle. I bought this one because it looks like it would be easier to do that. Not so! It also has sharpening wheels that are not as effective as my old one. So I use my old one.
1,"i gave this a try but wasnt thinking clear..this is not what the pros use theirs isnt as restricted,this product would be better with the wheels fully exposed...dont bind your blade in the plastic or your knife is ruined quickly...i get a way sharper and more even egde useing a cheap carbide hand sharpener...ive been sharpening knives sense i was a kid and can shave with all of them except for the ones i gotta fix because of this machine...total waste of money"
1,"This is without a doubt the worst possible knife sharpener made. I don't know who left the other reviews, but they must all work for the marketing department of the company that makes this piece of junk. For starters,the plastic housing is so flimsy and poorly made that the only possible result is that your knife will not be inserted at the proper angles for it to be correctly sharpened. When precisely following the instructions, the end result is that your knife is duller than when you started. Secondly, and probably most importantly, the motor on this device is so weak that it cannot take the slightest weight or pressure without coming to a complete stop. It really should be removed from the market. Unless you are only attempting to sharpen a thin bladed steak knife, this device will not have the power to turn the grinding stones. Even if you do manage to keep the stone turning the blade will be incorrectly ground and the knife will be duller."
1,I don't get it only one good song and that was Anywhere. The first album was that making love type joint this album don't set any kind of emotion. The beats where wack. They done fell off.
1,"Right, so this thing is pretty meh.Good: cheap, grinds things moderately well.Bad: It electrocutes you frequently, rusts easily, and has no good way of cleaning it.I use it to grind coffee and salt crystals. The salt crystals easily cause rust so it needs to be cleaned. If it's not cleaned it clogs and won't rotate-grind. Even without water near it, it electrocutes you.This thing still grinds but with the hassle of getting shocks (always having to unplug it) and that there's no good way of cleaning it, it's fairly rubbish. Only good thing was that it was incredibly inexpensive."
1,"I was away for a long period of time and used this grinder only a few times. On the 3rd use it broke, it just so happened the 3rd time I used it was months later. They refuse to have the heart to refund me. This seller does not care about customers sadly, which explains there very low rating understandably. I am actively seeking legal litigation as I gather more information and evidence. They clearly made it clear in the response email that the attitude was tough luck buddy and we dont give a crap. They will be hearing from me routinely as I will not take no for an answer. Also they are completely disorganized, labeling this same coffee grinder as a hamilton beach in one ad and a proctor sylix in others, they are lying even about what they are selling, I am also forwarding this to amazon in hopes of a sooner resolution. No one should buy or respect this joke of a seller."
1,bought this grinder thinking it would last at least a year. it broke within 3 months. retractable cord and other features don't outweigh that it's actually a cheap grinder. invest a little extra if you don't want the hassle of looking for another grinder soon after purchasing this one.
1,"I was looking for a cheap coffee grinder to grind spices, herbs and seeds. This is not the one, the locking mechanism/grind button is shabbily glued on and fell off after the first month. It still works but I have to jam a screwdriver in the safety latch everytime i need to grind."
1,"THIS GRINDER WAS WAY TOO SMALL BUT WAS EFFICIENT. I NEEDED TO GRIND A LARGER PORTION BUT IT WILL COME IN HANDY FOR SOMETHING ELSE...HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT WHAT, AS YET!"
1,This was given as a gift and it was used on an average of 2-3 times per week for the last two years grinding only coffee beans. I don't think that it was used to it's potential and is not worth the purchase.
1,"I purchased this blender new in sealed box, got it home, and it didn't work. The motor did turn the piece upon which the blade rests when the container is placed on the base, but the blade itself wouldn't turn (or turned sporadicallyl) - it appeared to be stripped such that it wouldn't entirely engage. I returned the item (the retailer said, ""yeah, you're right, it doesn't work.""). After about two months of light use on the new one, the same thing happened. I had it repaired under warranty (paying the shipping myself, of course) and, one month later, the same problem occurred. Two blenders, same problem, you do the math."
1,I have a book with 4 novels in it of hers and it is detailed to death. I find the stories too boring to even finish!!
1,"Someone earlier compared this product to a Jaguar, and I would agree - a Jaguar from the '60's with Lucas wiring harness. Mine looks great; used gently and with terrific results for about two years, then suddenly - no heat. Krups repair took about five weeks, and it was as wonderful as the day it was purchased. Today, after similar gentle use six months after the repair - same symptoms. It will not see the inside of the shop again. It is destined for the crusher. I'm pleased, at least, that I acquired it on sale for less than $25 as a loss leader. The repair also cost $25."
1,"Great sized crayons for little hands, but I am giving this product one star because half the crayons were broken in the box. Not what I was expecting to receive."
1,"This book was well written, but very confusing at points. The book rarely described the characters and when they did it was done poorly. In the end I still didn't get a good picture in my head of what Nate or John looked like. Overall I give this 2 stars, and do not recommend this book to anyone under the age of 12. If I could change/add something I would've been more descriptive about the main characters."
1,"I really don't have the words to describe how bad this movie was. Acting was horrible, plot line was unfathomable, and the camera work was crappy! I would recommend this DVD for skeet shooting!"
1,Upon receipt the bottom of the pot had a flaw in the porcelain. Also the unit is made in China and with their reputation for lead in the glazing I was not able to take a chance on using it.
1,"I used it for the first time yesterday. It smelled like something plastic or rubber inside the cooker was burning. I was really afraid it's going to burn and kept an eye on it for about 5 hours. The stew was well done but it did scare me. I have no experience with slow cooker, is this smell normal for first-time use, or the one I received has some problem?"
1,"I got this crock pot as an alternative to my larger crock pots, which often result in too many leftovers. The 2.5qt size is perfect for 2 people, and for smaller recipes like Mac N Cheese.Unfortunately, this crock pot is just too unreliable to use regularly. Even on Low, it cooks much too hot. This can result in burned or overcooked meals. Even worse, it has a hot spot. This means that if it's not stirred frequently during cooking - and thereby defeating most of the purpose of the crock pot - the food will burn and stick to the crock in that particular spot, even those times that the Low setting isn't too hot.In addition to the cooking problems, there is no ""Warm"" setting on this crock pot. Both of my larger crock pots have this feature, and while it is uncommon in smaller pots, I really miss it.I'll be putting this crock pot in the next yard sale and replacing it with theProctor Silex 3-qt. Slow Cooker."
1,"The walker has a few flaws. First of all the toy bar on the front table is not ideal. It is too close to the child and only a few inches away from the child's head. My son keeps bumping his forhead on the toybar when he is riding in the walker.....constantly. The seat is too tight and the crotch area on the seat is too high, it should be roomier and drop lower."
1,"I'm afraid I've got to agree with the earlier one-star reviews -- although, since the beauty of the work shines through the terrible transfer, I felt it deserved a better rating. I was lucky enough to find a copy of the BMG release on LaserDisc. The sound track, rescored for full symphony and recorded with state of the art digital technology, is awesome in sound and performance. The restored print is excellent on that version as well.Soundwise, the VHS version ought to be up to par with the laserdisc version."
1,"Although I truly love the film (and the video tranfer is great), this DVD has the horrible 1930's recording of the soundtrack. Prokofiev's great score sounds like it is playing from an AM radio placed undera mattress. Unless you are truly wedded to DVD format, get the BMG video which includes an excellent re-recording of the score in modern stereo (along with a great video). We can only hope that the BMG version gets to DVD soon."
1,Yet another garlic press that doesn't push all the garlic through. Leaves a good amount of perfectly good garlic in the chamber that you then have to remove and chop up. The search for a decent garlic press resumes!
1,"I bought this coffee maker in November of 2002. I enjoyed the coffee maker while it lasted. It looked good. It made good coffee. I was happy. I thought we had a good relationship. Then one morning I woke up and our relationship was over. There was no longer any fire in my coffee maker's heating element. I guess I was too demanding and the coffee maker just couldn't keep up. Poor guy. Now he just sits pathetically on my countertop with his broken heating element, dreaming of the good old days."
1,"I used it for one week and returned it back. The coffee was not hot enough. I tried two other Krups coffe makers (different models, both with timers) and I wasn't happy with either one. With all three Krups coffee makers I tried, coffee was just warm.I purchased a $20 machine with no name and I was happier."
1,I tried 2 of these and neither made a good cup of coffee. Eventually found the temperature of water at the basket was 175 and 177 degrees (too cool to properly brew coffee).If you want a great looking coffee maker get it.IF YOU WANT GOOD TASTING COFFEE LOOK ELSEWHERE.
1,"I have never read a book by Byatt but I found this book boring. The characters weren't great and I found myself not wanting to follow the story because of the droning paragraphs. I read constantly and hardly ever don't finish a book, but after 5 chapters I just couldn't force myself to read on."
1,"Price was surely attractive, but upon installation, the cartidge leaks ink all over the printed pages. Completely worthless to me, but can hardly afford $15.00 shipping to try to get a $21 refund."
1,"An otherwise perfectly fine toaster with a fatal problem: it dies. Bought 2, used them lightly, and both died in less than 1 year with exactly the same problem: the wire to one of the heater coils spontaneously burned up. Krups service would not acknowledge that this was a known syndrome and would not replace them. I see ... that I am not alone."
1,"EHC honestly could be one of the most horrible bands in existance. The lyrics could not be cheezier or more horrible. If I were any kind of Satanist, or member of The Church of Satan, I would be appauled that this is an attempt at representing my beliefs. It is simply and utterly shallow."
1,"We only used this to boil water. I guess we weren't careful enough with it, because almost immediatley it started getting rust around the edge of the heating element. It would wipe off, but then rust started developing all over the heating element."
1,"Boiled water Tuesday morning--so far so good. Came back Wednesday, rust on the bottom around and down inside the heating element. Even after cleaning, I was worried I wouldn't be able to get rid of all the rust. Back it goes."
1,"I gave this hot pot to a friend of mine and he initially loved it but then asked me to return it. It boils water quickly plus the 32 oz. capacity is not bad at all. One flaw though is that when water is left in the hot pot overnight or for a couple of hours, it's water with corrosion the next morning. The heating mechanism no doubt is not stainless but who can complain for 12 dollars? There is corrosion coming out from the heating ""plate"" but can be wiped clean from the outside or boil out all the water but then who wants to take chances with their health these days?"
1,"This kettle was cheap and it'll boil your water. Be careful not to put any water in it or it'll rust and you'll consume all sorts of exciting chemicals. It hasn't killed me yet, so it dodges the one-star rating."
1,"I bought one of these. After a couple of months, I had to discard it, as it leaked all over the counter top and down the front of the counter, ruining the finish. I was foolish enough to buy another. It did the same. Good thing Rival doesn't make aircraft."
1,"I bought my hot pot in June 2010. By April of 2011 it was showing signs of trouble. In May it decided when it wanted to heat water and when it didn't. By June it was dead. Guess they just don't make them like they used to.Also, the cord was so short as to make the unit difficult and dangerous to use.So sorry to see this ""classic"" appliance be thrown under the bus. My previous Hot Pot lasted years and years. Something has changed internally and the customer is footing the bill."
1,"I've owned this kettle less than six months, but I will be cutting the cord off and throwing it in the trash so that nobody fishes it out and tries to use it. The plate has rusted, but more worryingly, it makes horrible ""burning electronics"" smells when it's in use. Additionally, the lid is very hard to open, which is exciting in a bad way when the water inside is at full boil. Aside from those petty, petty ""life safety"" issues, the cord is too short.Save your money up a little while longer and go with a nicer kettle. This thing is dangerous garbage."
1,"Bummer - I had my old one for at least 10 years but this one has an OVAL reservoir for blades which of course spin in a perfect CIRCLE, so the coffee gets ground too fine and gets stuck in the ends of the oval. This is why others have complained about the sludge in their coffee. The obvious solution would have been to make the reservoir ROUND, not OVAL. You end up having to use a brush to get out the ultrafine coffee trapped in the ends of the well. Truly idiotic, especially for a company like Krups, which traditionally made such beautiful products. So, I'm looking for another new one now. At least it wasn't horribly expensive, but still....."
1,"I'm not entirely sure what the design flaw is with this grinder, but it is virtually impossible to grind beans and take the top off without grounds coming out and spreading over the counter. Not a huge deal in the scheme of things - it does do a decent job of grinding if a little unevenly, and it's cheap. You can, however, get a much better tool for the task."
1,"This worked fine for a little over two years. Recently, it started not spinning when activating the unit. Giving it a couple of turns would get it working again. Today, it didn't work at all and it was almost impossible to turn it. I attempted to remove the blade thinking it was just clogged under it. Well, you cannot remove the blade easily. It has a plastic nut on it that when you go to remove it, it just gets destroyed."
1,"These grinders are indestructible. They do a great job and last forever. Why only 1 star? Krups has recently shortened the electrical cord on this appliance by 23 INCHES. Unbelievable, but true. Did they think we wouldn't notice? Did they try it out for themselves in a regular kitchen that doesn't have electrical outlets every 12"" on the counters and/or backsplash?Just how much money did they save themselves by eliminating that extra 23"" of cording? Did the customer's experience factor into the decision? The use of the grinder is severely limited when there's not enough electrical cord to reach a convenient outlet."
1,it doesn't work in UK and it cost 44 to get an adapter!!!!!I am not happy!!!it is not worth to pay post and send it back either!!!!
1,"We bought the Krups 203-42 to replace the same model bought 7 years ago. The previous grinder we used avidly and enjoyed for the most part. However, this replacement smelled of burning motor (you can't mistake this smell!) on the first use and every use until I decided to return it. I'm looking for another brand."
1,"after reading so many good reviews about this product, i bought it believing that it was a very good purchase !!But it stopped working the second time I used it !! There was nothing to be done to fix it, because it comes assembled in one single piece and it is impossible to check the inside to see what is wrong with it !! Worst purchase ever !!"
1,"I used this grinder for coffee only. It worked great for about 2 1/2 months but then died. The motor quit. I don't use really oily beans and I never overfill the grinder, so I'm not sure why it quit... I expected to get at least a years use. For the price, I guess I got my money/use out of it... I did use it on a daily basis - once in the morning and once in the afternoon."
1,I used the grill about 6 times and did think it was a great alternative to heating up my oven. I found it needed a few more minutes than the suggested cooking time but cleanup was fast and easy.
1,"With no disrespect to those who wrote positive reviews, I find this release only slightly better than ""All This Everything"" [...] But hey, at least I enjoyed Teakwood Betz off of this release!"
1,"Worked great for six months, then the motor started burning up and I could smell it very strongly. We only use it for slicing bread and I expected it to last much longer."
1,"The blades are nice and sharp, but this knife weighs a ton - not good, since you have to hold down the ""on"" switch the whole time. But worse than that was the overheating. The unit got HOT after slicing up only half a loaf of biscotti. If it can't take that, how on earth would it make it through a whole turkey?!Next time I'll lay out more cash for a knife that can actually handle a little work."
1,Actually carved my turkey very nicely. But the locking mechanism for the blades broke the very first time it was used.
1,I have seen and listened to most all of Beamer's instruction and all of it seems way to difficult for me. I am a pretty good learner but it always seems like his teaching takes a lot for granted. Just my two cents.
1,"OK: I admit it, I like suspense and thriller novels. If I am going to read fiction, it is worthwhile to invest my time in something not only heart-stopping but within the realm of credulity. Sadly, this is not the case for David Dun's novel The Black Silent. Though touted as a rival to Michael Crichton, he is not in that league.I am a sophisticated reader, holding a PhD in English Literature and having taught in that discipline. With that admission, I found the novel confusing and poorly plotted. It is from cover to cover one extended chase scene involving for the most part poorly developed characters. It became tiresome.I was expecting more. I got much less. My judgement: take a pass."
1,"Another thing to add to the list of problems (hot handle, ridiculous tiny, deep crevices to clean with a toothpick) other reviewers have mentioned is the lack of a ""floating hinge"". It is unable to keep the two plates parallel as the waffle expands. So the front opens further, resulting in a back dark half and light front half. Of course, if you underfill, you'll get a dark bottom and light top.The Krups brochure included has a motto on the front: ""Quality by design."" Well, quality is indeed directly related to design and this unit has rather little of either.(BTW, some reviewers seem to have misunderstood the purpose of the ""ready"" light. As explained in the manual, it merely indicates whether the heating element is on. You can start baking when it first turns off, but when it comes back on it doesn't necessarily mean the waffle is done. It just means the plates cooled to the point where the thermostat kicked back in.)"
1,I've had this grill for a year..but it stopped working. So..it was great..but i guess you get what you paid for. Its life is as good as its one year warranty!
1,The seller was correct in informing us that the HP C4191A cartridge they were selling was new but what they failed to mention was that it has been expired for almost 4 years. Maybe it would be fine if we tried it but we didn't want to take any chances and returned the product. I'm so hoping honesty returns to our world someday. Good Luck all.
1,"I was disappointed to find i could not grill meat with a bone in it. I was hoping to use my grill to cook t-bone steaks, and pork chops. I tryed grilling hamburger for pasta sauce, but the grill was a mess when I finished. It took a lot longer to clean then my regular fry pan normally takes. I am not sure what I will use it for as we only cook burgers on the barbeque in the summer. This products takes up alot of cupboard space for so little uses."
1,"I'm really disappointed with this order. The package did not include the spatula which is supposed to be included with the order. However, the Hamilton Beach 25325 MealMaker really works great as advertised. Where's my spatulaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"
1,"It works very well, when it's not broken. Unfortunately, in the 2+ months since I bought one, 2 have broken. The bowl on the first one cracked in several places after about 3 uses, the store gave my a new one, then only a little more than a month later, it suddenly died while chopping nuts."
1,We purchased this high-end can opener because of the safety of the lid removing process and the quality that is supposed to be associated with Krups. The thing didn't last a year and we don't even open a can a day. It basically fell apart. The cutter can't be serviced with a simple replacement part. I won't pay to fix it or buy another one. We replaced it with a manual opener that does the same job for under $10 and it's easy to use. Hamilton Beach makes an opener that does the same lid removal for around $20 at discount stores.
1,Have had two of these openers and both lasted less than a year and then would not open cans No where to repair them Harmon Wall
1,this is in german not english which it never mentions in the ad for it so for those of us who do not speak german it is a bomb
1,I did not get to play the movie due to the fact it came in the wrong langage...I speak english and it's something I do not understand!!!
1,"Pretty sure this item is a fake. This is one of my favorite movies, and the quality of the film is alright but I'm almost positive it's a burned DVD with a printed sticker on top."
1,I realize it said it was a different region but I didn't know what that meant. Now we have a movie we can't even watch
1,i did not see anywhere on the details for this dvd that it was in manderain!! i was informed buy the seller on how to change it to English but i could not even get the dvd to play in order to do that. i can play every other dvd i own but the foreign one i bought by acctcident wont even load. go figure!
1,"I loved The Lion King so of course I had to get this. I knew it wouldn't be as good, but watching it, it turned out to be a lot worse than I imagined... the songs were TERRIBLE, and the storyline was UNORIGINAL...why did Disney bother?? I wouldn't reccommend this, even if The Lion King is your fave movie."
1,"Erm...well the basic point here is that this movie SUX! But more to the point is that I was sleepin over at my frendz house and we were watchin this to make fun of it and we got to the part right before they sing the song about Kovu gettin exiled and Simba sez ""When you came here, you asked for judgement, WELL I PASS IT NOW!"" Then the animals in the background start mumbling and I heard one go ""YES YOU'RE GAY!"" and I rewinded it over and over and I swear to god, you can hear them say that! I didn't get it off a website or anything like that, I FOUND IT MYSELF! Yeah...I have no life..."
1,"This one looks like it's never going to get off the ground, but actually picks up about half way through and becomes a worthwhile watch, but by then it is far too late to take this one past the 2 star category. I felt like I would have been better off by just watching the original Lion King over again instead of spending my time with this average at best sequel."
1,We rank this movie 29th out of the 41 Disney Animated movies that we ranked. It was never that well liked compared to the other movies we own. It helped a little that the original actors returned to do the voices.
1,"Gloria Gaynor has like 5 greatest/bestof/collection cds out there.This specific cd has a slower version of ""never can say goodbye"" that is not as good as the ones I have heard on other cdsIt also has 2 versions of ""I will survive"" and also as part of a medley on the last track. NONE of them are as good as the original. One of them is slow and is undanceable, the other 2 have a horible echo thing going on.I strongly urge you to get a different greatest hits disc from Gloria Gaynor."
1,Difficult to get started. Locks up after clamp-down with inadequate motor buzzing. You must remove can or burn up motor. Locking/clamp-down arm keeps falling off if you lift it up too high. I threw it out and ordered another brand.
1,This is a horrible geometry book. It is not good at explaining the proofs. Don't waste your time with this book.
1,"i think geometry is boring, this book needs to make it exciting, like... it needs... fire, and maybe some dancing chimps. Maybe i'm just special."
1,"I have used Maxtor 250 GB external drives for years. Only of several units failed. But I have had terrible experience with the 1.5 TB Maxtor drive. First unit installed ok (as mirrored backup drive), but failed after two months. Replacement unit was DOA. It would not install properly. Second replacement unit would not format at first, but after many tries did format and run briefly. It is now inoperative. Maxtor should not be selling the 1.5 TB units. I have since learned that many others have also had bad experience with them. This has been very time consuming for me. It is ironic that the system I purchased as a highly reliable, mirrored backup drive was so unreliable itself."
1,"I bought my watch from Watch Grabber less than one year ago. It was made by Swiss Army and it is supposedly waterproof up to 100 meters. My watch recently started letting in water, so I called Amazon and Swiss Army to inquire about their warranty. Neither could offer me any warranty service, and I was told to contact the distributor (Watch Grabber) directly. Watch Grabber told me it had a two year warranty on all of the watches it sold. I told Watch Grabber about my problem. Conveniently, however, Watch Grabber's ""warranty"" does not cover ""water damage."" I asked where I could find the terms of its watch warranty. I was told the terms are located on Watch Grabber's website. I cannot find any warranty information on Watch Grabber's website. Shady. Watch Grabber does not deserve a one star rating, but I had to rate one star to submit this review."
1,"Item does not shut off when the kettle is on and there is no water in the chamber! Instead of failing safely, Instructions for Use describe that the heating element oscillates between extremely hot to a period of cooling down, and then a return to a very hot state. This oscillation apparently goes on indefinitely. Once this happens, the intructions indicate your product may no longer work properly. More importantly, people buy electric kettles for their certainty and this description just breeds uncertainty. Thus, the HB Kettle appears poorly designed and very well may be an unsafe consumer product. PURCHASE an electric kettle which just SHUTS OFF when it detects no water present in the kettle and the kettle is on."
1,"This book is by no stretch of the imagination good at what it aims to do...teach accounting. The explanations are lengthy and tend not to explain the concept fully. I have taken previous accounting courses and this text is laughably horrible.Not only that, but the problems at the end of the chapter are absolutely horrendous. These problems are poorly worded and require further explanation from the professor (who sometimes has no clue himself).This book does nothing to prepare me for a future in financial analysis.All in all, I would only recommend this book if a person really wanted to find a reason to commit suicide or simply die of boredom."
1,"While the book does have a lot of great information, it is also riddled with editorial errors -- and I'm not just talking spelling. Statements in one section often contradict statements in another part of the book. Don't use this book as a primary resource. And definitely don't use this book if you prefer ""attachment"" parenting."
1,"These batteries take a bit longer to charge up and once charged, they discharge quite rapidly. The best indicator I have of their performance is when they are used to power a portable LCD TV. Within 10 minutes of use, the screen will start to grey out. With other brands of NiMH batteries this event usually doesnt occur until the 1.5 hour mark. I am guessing these batteries can maintain max amperage for only a brief period of time. My kids have noticed that these batteries only last about 1/5 as long in powering their Gameboy. This brand is not recommended."
1,"I have tried quite a few different brands of Nimh batteries, and Sunpak batteries are the worst brand I have tried (out of 8 brands). They do not provide nearly the rated amount of current (The Sunpak 2300 cells that I bought all tested out at less than 1500ma capacity with a 250ma current draw) They do not hold their voltage as well as other brands under load either.Do not get this brand! It just doesn't measure up."
1,"This is the second dish I got, and this again has little cracks and holes in the glazing. Since they go all the way through the glazing these spots will turn brown and might even crack further. The butter dish is b-quality and should have been marked as such or sorted out. As much as I like the solidity and the size, the quality isn't there."
1,"There are two versions of this book advertised on the Kindle page. One says, ""Mao's Last Dancer, Young Reader's Edition."" The other says, ""Mao's Last Dancer"". They are BOTH Young Readers Editions. I wasted $12 on this book. I contacted Amazon about the problem was they didn't understand what the problem was. Oh, well...."
1,I recommend not spending the money on this version because it does not have any notes in it. There are a lot better choices out there that are easier to understand.
1,"I ordered two books on the same date from the same company thinking I would get the books at the same time. They were needed for a class. One book arrived the next week and the other book has yet to arrive. After next week I will no longer even need the book that I am still waiting on. When I wrote the company they said it was on its way, but that was quite a while ago. I purposefully chose a company that posted both books and was located close enough to get the books in time for class."
1,"While I enjoyed PARTS of this play, I thought Mr. Shakespeare was a little confused about the central nature of love and compasion. Its still an interestingread, though. I recommend thatyou buy it, despite its nebulous approach toward life and love."
1,"This ice shaver worked great while it lasted. With daily usage the plastic gears broke after one month and the shaver is now history. I would recommend purchasing a more durable shaver.Other observations while the shaver worked:The ice bin catches the ice well but the thin, crescent shape makes pouring the ice out messy and tedious. Spooning out little bits with a spoon or spatula is easier.The shaver can be disassembled for cleaning. However, if the alignment is not set EXACTLY the hopper will not spin = no shaved ice."
1,"Everyone loves changing their oil & filter right?Nope - It's something that has to be done & we do it.However, Purolator filters are are not very good at filtering your oil.I have run Wix filters for years with no problems or complaints.I run Full Synthetic Motor oil and chance oil & filter every 2800 - 3000 miles.My engine oil had always come out clean, almost like new looking until my Wix dealer had to Special order me a case of Wix filters, thus I purchased these Purolator filters.After running 600 miles I checked my oil level and found my oil to be filthy.I changed the oil and filter using a new Wix filter, after 2862 miles my oil was like brand new.I'll pay the extra $ for quality!"
1,The repetitiveness of this cd kills me. All of the songs have a few lines that are repeated over and over and over. 2 min into the song you have the line memorized and are ready for the next song. Unfortunately there is another 2-3 minutes of song left to suffer through. Hey Mr. DJ is alright and Georgia isn't bad but the rest are just repetitive.
1,"Being in the mist of animal grief right now I just recently got this book. One of the things the author says is why one is grieving is to not look at the animal's toys or photos until later. Well the first thing I wnat to do is to have their photo out. She seems to contradict herself when she says there is no right or wrong way to heal then she says don't do this or that. I found the book trite, unfeeling ,and cold. I am sorry I bought it. I will return it and get ""The Loss of A Pet"" instead."
1,I'm afraid that this product was so incredibly messy that it did not prove practical to use. It left a muddy residue in the bathroom and was not possible to use on the hands under gloves to treat the skin overnight because of the risk of ruining both the gloves and the the sheets.I feel this product is better suited for use in a spa or clinic than for general home use.
1,"This book refers to version 4 of the Dragon Naturally Speaking program. The current version is number 9, and is very significantly different from version 4. I don't know why this book is being offered for sale. Do not buy it."
1,"I installed two of these at my house two years ago because I liked the screw-in feature. Since then, four of the six valves have had the worst possible problem: sticking in the open position after power is cut off to the solenoid. This made a mushy mess of my lawn and even resulted in some flooding to my basement. Shamefully shoddy. Use anything but this."
1,I am not sure what Orbit is thinking about but when I went to replace one of these manifolds from about 5 years ago the new one is about 2 inches too long and the outlets are 1/2 too far apart to retrofit. This is inexplicably stupid. To engineer something that will not replace a previous part simply puts you out of the market. I did as advised here and ordered a Rainbird mainfold and valve set. If I have to go in and re-engineer the entire valve system I'm sure not going to do it with something that can't be fixed or updated and that customer service won't even respond to. I couldn't even find a older model on the secondary market. I will admit that the valves actually gave me no trouble over the last few years and they ARE available. But the manifold is not. Pretty ridiculous.
1,"There's no question that Danny Gatton is one of the greatest guitarists that has ever graced the planet, but it's pretty tough to follow what's going on if you're trying to learn how he does it. It's a whole lot of playing, which of course is mind boggling and wonderful. But when there is instruction, there's not enough explanation to exactly what's going on and then he just starts playing again -- really fast. Even the slowed down examples are hard to follow as the camera angles miss what he's doing in the left hand. I bought a Redd Volkaert DVD called Stolen Licks and it was about 10-15 ""riffs"" that he clearly explains, not to mention how clear the video is.I'm sure I'll learn a couple of things from the Gatton video, but, really, shame on Arlen Roth for not making sure it was much clearer."
1,"I bought this skillet with high hopes, however, I was very dissapointed after using it, and I ended up returning it. The biggest problem is that the heating is extrememly uneven. Someting you are cooking near where the heating elements (under the skillet)may cook in 4 minutes while things not near the elements will take 12 minutes. The skillet also, did not have enough power to keep all the oil in it at a high enough temperature to properly fry things."
1,The base of this juicer is flimsy. When you press down on the handle the base flexes and the head backs away from the fruit resulting in minimal juice extracted. There are better products out there for cheaper.
1,"This coffee maker looks good in the picture and sitting on the counter - until you try to use it. Within five minutes of putting water in the maker, the coffee maker was sitting in a pool of water, leaking from the bottom - not a great way to start the morning."
1,"Crusade, the thematic is very poor...seems to be released for children...the actors are very bad but it is the Director's fault including story...I lost my money...I only saw two disc hoping better of this movie but it didn't happen..."
1,"The pump arrived fine and is a good Jabsco pump. However, the picture and description are wrong. The title says it all ""Pump ONLY"". If you think this is a combination pump/faucet as the description says, you are wrong. This is ONLY for the pump.I'm giving this rating to the vendor ""gizmos for less"" not the pump. The pump should work just fine.I have since ordered the faucet and the shipping was over $12. That seems like high shipping for such a small part.Had I known that, I would have bought a pump combo for this same price on eBay. I was trying to be loyal to Amazon. I contacted Amazon customer service and they responded politely but informed me this is a 3rd party vendor and I should contact them directly. I really didn't feel like arguing with them."
1,"very unhappy about the book, because you wrote your name on the book and then you want to sell it to someone. that's not very nice"
1,"dont waste your money, just go to junk yard and get a real one out of a car for this washer pump. this annco was really cheap junk"
1,"Although I want to like it, I can't help but being deceived by this release. I considered Marisa as one of the most promising Brazilian singers, as all her previous albums were very creative and original, but here she falls in the anodyne mainstream pop/rock trend, with sugary ballads and dummy rock numbers. Besides, the extremely overelaborated arrangements interfere to much in her vocals. In fact, just three of the tracks are appealing to me: ""Para ver as meninas"", a melancholic samba, ""Perdo voc"", a Carlinhos Brown song composed especially for this album which is the only really fresh, creative track, and the Marisa Monte composition ""Abolol"", fortunately only accompanied by piano. In average, an avoidable album. If you don't have her previous releases, buy those ones, since they are much better. And let's hope this album is just an anomaly in her career which won't happen again."
1,"If I could have gotten the batteries to stay in the buster, it might have worked...cheap...have had better busters in the past. Pretty dissapointed."
1,"This item is of the ""As Seen on TV"" ilk. It is flimsy, so poorly constructed that the battery cover will not seat if there are batteries in place. When I tried to put the battery cover on, the shaver almost split in two down a center seam/joint. The lint receptacle barely hangs on the shaver. Enough said - find a different sweater shaver!"
1,"Absolute piece of junk. Oil heated and then quit heating after expensive food was placed in it. After oil cooled to barely warm, it started heating again. Ruined the food. Ruined dinner. Sure glad I didn't have company over for dinner. Should have left the shrimp in it when I returned it."
1,I thought I was getting a good deal with this deep fat fryer but the quality was really poor. I used the fryer only once because the lid did not seal properly and I ended up with oil & water from condensation dripping down the side. I returned the product and received a full refund. The safety plug was hard to use and the basket size is too small for more than two people.
1,"britney spears will always be one of my favourite artist of all time regardless of the lack of effort in songs... especially on this single ""do something""....""do something"" IS one of her worst singles to date... she is riding off of the ""toxic"" beat and put really cheesy lackluster lyrics into the song....i understand that she has to experiment on songs or whatever but this experiment went wrong...and dont get me started on the video... she looks sooooo friggin terrible in the clip.... she is not dancing, her makeup is just horrible, and them flying around in a HUMMER!!!!! come on!!!!!if you are a britney fan and have never heard this song before.... be careful...."
1,"I have to admit most of Britney's songs are a little infectious, but this... this is something else. O_O; I guess she's trying to go for a new style, which I respect, but this experiment didn't turn out too well. This song sounds like some sort of cheap knock-off of Gwen Stefani's ""What You Waiting For"" - although that song is actually an easy on the ears, fun track. This though... O_O Britney, please, stop experimenting."
1,Doesn't work on newer MAC OS. This should be stated in the ad. The item was in very good condition.
1,"This video is definitely not up to par when compared to the rest of the Baby Einstein series. I was so excited to get the new video and after watching it, I was extremely disappointed. It feels very ""Disneyfied"". There are no real puppets anymore...just animated ones. The music is just re-used from other videos. All in all, it didn't really hold his attention for more than about 10 minutes. Don't waste your money on this one!"
1,"This is a completely failed attempt at creating a film about Bix Beiderbecke that even remotely touches on the real facts of his life - which are actually much more interesting than anything this film has to offer.Some of the music is excellent but it is a recreation; nothing of the real Bix can be heard.Finally, the actors do not look like the characters they are supposed to represent, least of all the guy playing Bix who does not resemble him whatsoever.If you want to learn about the real Bix - then better not waste your money on this."
1,"I waited and waited for these two episodes to come out since I just couldn't get enough of Cowboy Bebop. After this poor excuse of an ending came on Adult Swim that night, I wanted to mail a bomb to Japan! When Edward and Ein left the Bebop crew for good, the rest of the series episodes began going down in flames. Bad move right there. Sappy love stories and cliche rivalies between former friends has given this series a bad name. Hello people! This was suposed to be about bounty hunters that face action adventure and mayhem all the way through! In fact these are the same mistakes that most anime shows make. I only gave this two stars instead of one since it had some readical action in it."
1,"It is rather insane to offer a book at such a ridiculously high price, and yet fail to explain WHY the book is considered to be worth so much. There is no list of contents, no synopsis, and no other benchmark by which to judge the sale of this book. Is the king running around with no clothes again??"
1,"Would like to see a table of contents and pictures or excerpts -like for so many other books- to be able to make a decision on whether to buy it or not, then I might right a review."
1,I bought these for my 2nd grader at the begining of the school year and within 6 weeks he had a huge hole in the toe area. I thought Pony would be better quality. Maybe it is my son being too rough on his shoes? My 5 year old has the same shoe and his aren't as bad.
1,This is the worst can opener I have ever purchased. It didn't work the way it was supposed to. Very difficult. I didn't send it back because it would have cost almost as much for the shipping. I threw in away!
1,This DVD is nothing but a direct reproduction of the decrepit 35mm film. No attempt has been made at restoration; the sound track is exceptionally poor; the subtitles almost unreadable at times.Don't be suckered in. Wait for a better distributor of this magnificent film.
1,"What this description fails to mention is that the set is very very small. The box is 19 by 11 by 3 inches. The chips are not full sized chips. In fact, they're about the size of nickles. The dice are not normal sized dice. The blackjack table is useless because you can barely fit three hands on it. The quality of the wood is poor. Mine came with nicks and dents on it. The vendor should have listed its dimensions."
1,"Do yourself a favor and don't watch it. Bad acting, no plot, predictable and just terrible. Whoever wrote the script and directed this movie needs to get fired."
1,"The Suspense aspect was the movie's best feature. The Right-To-Die Message and the slurs against the Defense Establishment were turn-offs. From here, I'm going to spoil a bit, so stop if you don't want to know.The notion of being reincarnated as a public employee in Chicago as a sort of Liberal Nirvana would be parody in a saner world. Then again, if the world were sane, I wouldn't have seen this movie in the first place."
1,"I figured that with a 2 adult household this would be ideal.<br /><br />I wore it out in 3 weeks. <br /><br />Look, want to make really lean ground meat? A minichopper should do that, right? You buy a slab of pork or beef that's low in marbling, cut it into cubes and this should make you ground meat. Well, it'll jam, even if you only put 3 or 4 cubes in it.<br /><br />It wears out quick.<br /><br />Going to crush any ice or grind meat? Spend money on a higher wattage stronger machine.<br /><br />Otherwise, you'll just buy one after another after another of these.<br /><br />"
1,"I was new to online shopping when I purchased this product. Now I know to read the reviews. This can opener is the worse I have ever had. It worked for 2 weeks and then the magnet that holds the can lid broke off and I had to glued it back. Now every can light or heavy, small or medium slips off the can when trying to open it. It will only make a hole a couple centimeters at a time. It takes me so long to get it opened enough for me to pry the rest that my arms get tired holding up the can. By the time I am done there are shreds of paper and metal all over and in the can. Please save your money, I am on my way to buy another can opener right now. I might pick up a hand held just in case this happens again."
1,"At first it worked fine. I liked the feature of making it taller for tall cans. I like that it is made of hard plastic and it has eye appeal. After about 3 years, maybe less, the whole piece with the magnetic disc came off and it was annoying trying to get it back in there. I don't see the point in not making that a permanent piece in it's construction. After being burned with other Sun-beam products, I don't buy anything with that name on it. Nothing that they make lasts very long."
1,Will give it a one star because the dvd still hasnt arrived yet and it was orderd 6 weeks ago!not impressed so far!
1,NO KNIFE SHARPENER OF BACK.PICTURE SHOWED KNIFE SHARPENER.VERY DISAPOINTED.AM RETURNING THIS ITEM.
1,"Bought this as a gift for my parents. Was disappointed as soon as I got the camera in my hands.1) Very 'cheap' feel to it. Lightweight plastic body.2) Preview screen has very low resolution. I found the LCD screen to be difficult to use because of the low quality3) FIXED FOCUS. I completely missed that this camera has no optical zoom or auto-focus. Thus, every picture you take with the dig. zoom is bound to be fuzzy.The only plus I found is very easy-to-use controls."
1,"While I'm sure many kitties love the stuff mine didn't want to get near it. Too bad, I thought she would and I could mix her medicine in it."
1,"This burner died after less than a month of (admittedly heavy) use. It worked fine one morning and later that day when I tried to turn it on, nothing happened.It was great when it was working, though."
1,"This book is truly tacky! The tone almost sounds like tabloid reporting. Yes, there are scams in the bridal industry, but not everything is a scam! I think the Fields' need to stick to a field they have credentials in...it seems that this book was written by a former bride who is looking to capitalize on making others paranoid. I say PASS ON THIS ONE, DEFINITELY!"
1,"As a new bride, I thought this book was --well--let's say---BORING!. No style..no design and these authors are ""lost"" as far as what brides want in the 21st century. If you are young, hip and cool, this book is not for you. If you are old on a 4th marriage, you might like it. Also-warning ..these authors have TERRIBLE reviews on their Baby Bargains book. It seems they write all their own great reviews. I think Martha Stewart weddings is OBVIOUSLY much better and I also think I would not recommend a book from Denise and Alan Field's EVER."
1,"These are just general review cards -- they don't really prepare you for taking the GMAT. They are interesting for keeping up on general pre-calc math and vocab though.I prefer the Princeton Review products, though they don't have flashcards.Cracking the GMAT with DVD, 2008 Edition (Graduate Test Prep)"
1,"About 200 cards are strictly centered on vocabulary words, which are NOT on the GMAT. How could I actually believe that this company even KNOWS what's on the GMAT? I completely lost confidence in the product and will never us it. What a waste of money."
1,"This mixer has many speed settings, but they all pretty much go the same speed. The ""low"" setting is so fast that if you are mixing much liquid it spashes all over. I would not recommend this mixer, spend a few more dollars and get a better one!!!"
1,I bought this impact just about a year ago and it just died on me. Automotive repair is my profession and I use this impact about half as much as my 1/2 inch impact. With that I was expecting a lot longer service out of it.
1,"We've seen it all before, and done better, by about a thousand writers. This one, however, seems to be written by a 16-yr-old. Every predictable plot turn is there. The characters are Kleenex-thin, the motivations spelled out but implausible. And despite the pro-forma Chinese girlfriend character, this is viciously racist stuff. I think the Asian-American community will turn away from this offensive nonsense en masse, or they should. I know Asian booksellers will. Tired and juvenile in the extreme."
1,"The Iomega Rev 35 GB drive is fine for backing up and archiving files. But it has two shortcomings that make the drive ""unacceptable"" to me. For one thing, you cannot defragment the Rev cartridges. The Rev 35 drive simply does not show up when you open up Windows (2000) defragmenter. Also, I purchased Iolo Technologies Search and Recover 2 for recovering and shredding deleted files. S&R2 is a great product but, again, the Rev 35 drive does not appear in the drive list. I have contacted support at both Iomega and Iolo Technologies to no avail . . . Buy a different drive."
1,"I would like Amy Sohn (and Ariel Steiner) much better if they weren't so breathtakingly self-absorbed. Amy is a good writer, but it's hard after a while to care about and root for someone who is so completely consumed with themselves. She comes across as very insecure and very ambitious, which is a deadly combination."
1,"gosh, havent we seen this boring thing eighty times already. I heard about Sohn from one of my freinds who kinda likes her, but this isnt at all what i was expecting. really bad. doesnt do anything for us women, but another bad book about how just cant get together."
1,"Awful doesn't begin to describe it. The writing is bad, the characters are both self-absorbed and self-indulgent, and the wit is remarkably unwitty. If you like reading about sex or getting worldly advice from preening neurotics, by all means, read it. Anyone else should steer well clear."
1,"What a piece of crap and off shore support is even worse. I was only able to sync two pictures even though the spec calls for ""up to 50."" Only message is ""sync failed."" When I called support, they disconnected me the first time. When I called back, they said that it can only hold one or two pictures.The manual is very poor and says nothing about how much memory this device has. I'm assuming that my pictures are larger than the capacity of this unit, but I can't tell from the manual. I got this as a gift. Hopefully the giver didn't spend much money."
1,"I did not purchase this set but have purchased two new royal brushes over a month ago. They fell apart in just two uses, 10 mins each about. I contacted the company 3 times and have still never heard back. I will never buy a royal product ever again..."
1,"as of march 21, 2006, this product never shipped and it was ordered in january. At this point I canceled the order, since 25% of the year is just about up. Not happy camper.Can't really rate stars about item, but won't let me post unless I do... wouldn't suggest ordering it at this point...."
1,"I bought this toy in September as a start to my Christmas shopping. I pulled it out of the box this weekend to start wrapping gifts and am devastated by it! One of the front paws is sewn on sideways, the tail is sewn to the back of one of the legs, the hair is a mess, and the ears won't stay up. It's over the 30 days so I am going to try and see if I can make it look better with some cutting and sewing, but the way it looks now I would never give it to anyone!"
1,"I purchased this book to use as a text for a beginning programming class and found the programming logic to be adequate, but overall I am not impressed with the way the author tries to teach Java in the text. I found his outline to learn and his methods of teaching the basics very poorly laid out. I feel it did not teach the basics of learning programming in any language, much less Java. What it did address, I don't feel it was presented in the proper order...he tried to teach you how to run before you even knew that you had feet. I would not recommend using this book to learn Java. This book was my initial exposure to programming and the only thing I learned for sure is that there has to be a better way to learn Java, or any other programming language, than the author presents in this book."
1,"I've owned the DAV-c990 Dreamsystem for over two years. Looks great in my living room, but the first thing I noticed is it just doesn't have the best sound, especialy for music cds. Movies sound OK. I am currently having problems with it reading discs, ejecting discs etc. I've gone thru all the troubleshooting I could find in the manual, on line and thru Sony. It still doesn't work.I've learned from research on the web that many people have had the same problems. I hope I can get mine fixed. I recomend moving on to a different unit or brand."
1,"I didn't like this album very much. I don't know why. It just....wasn't very interesting. I didn't find ANY songs that caught my interest at all. I was very disappointed.Then again, I don't really know why I don't like it. Maybe because it's rather bland? I don't know. It's just not very interesting at all."
1,"Expecting to learn the truth about the Chechen War from Anna Politkovskaya is like expecting to learn the truth about the Iraq War from Michael Moore. Very biased and propogandic account by a Liberal reporter who has claimed to want to be the ""Russian Michael Moore."" Anna tries to make excuses for the terrorist acts committed by Chechen Jihadists. Too much has happened since she wrote this book, and there is no sympathy for Wahabbi terrorists who strap suicide belts on brainwashed women and send them into restaurants, subways, concerts, airplanes, and kindergardens. If you want to know the real facts about Chechnya, read a book by an American counter-terrorist expert, Wolves of Islam."
1,It stopped turning after using it for less than 5 times. Opened it and found the adapter connecting the motor and the shaft broke because it is made of plastic. I can't understand how it passed UL and ETL with the design like that. Don't waste your money.
1,"Smells like burning electronics, leaks oil or some other kind of goo out the bottom, VERY loud, and it is hard to clean (to my standard of clean anyway)"
1,"Have been using this hand blender for about 3 months (so perfect for mixing protein shakes..., then I notice a nasty smell and gunk coming out of the bottom. no matter how many times I clean it, the stuff just keeps coming out. It looks greasy, but it smells absolutely rotten. I opened the thing up and it was full of rotten gunk that apparently goes up the the blade shaft while mixing. literally tried to wash it out, to no avail. have to throw it away since there is no feasible way to clean it. (it seriously could not get more rotten). I did not however experience any of the motor burning out or blade falling off issues I've read in here. (so I gave it an extra star for lasting so long....lol)"
1,"Good points:1. It's really, really cheap.2. This blender worked well while it worked and was easy to clean.Bad points:1. You have to hold down the speed button for as long as you want to run the blender. This gave me cramps in my hand.2. Loud3. Has a moderate tendency to splash (I've had better, I've had worse).4. Fell apart after 6 months; the switch broke and the handle began to split. Due to the breakage I suffered a light electric shock from touching the sauce that the appliance was immersed in.My conclusion? Spend twice as much for a good hand blender, which will last longer and save you money in the long run."
1,"After having this mixer for about one year, the beaters started bumping into each other and falling out in the middle of mixing. Also, when I use the burst of power feature, I have to turn the mixer all the way up to level 6 and then back down to off, or it won't turn off. My mother bought this same model about the same time I did last year, and after one use, it just wouldn't turn on anymore. One positive thing is that the Sunbeam customer service has been friendly and easy to deal with. My mom's replacement mixer seems to be working fine. I will get mine in a couple of weeks, and we'll see how it works!"
1,"I'm sorry to say that this item was very disappointing, due mostly to the poor quality of a small but critical part made of very chincy plastic.As desribed, the actual hangar itself is made of a very high grade wood. But the unit that supports the hangar and mounts via spring-loaded tension between the posts under the headrest is poor quality plastic -- and not well designed.As a result, the unit broke less than a week after I received it simply because I bumped it.A similar car hangar device that I owned lasted me about three years. It's base unit was made of plastic, too. When I received this one I thought I was going to be even happier because of the beautiful wood hangar design. But without a better support device, this is just a nice hangar that has no useful purpose to me now. Perhaps my dog will enjoy chewing on it."
1,"I wish I read the reviews before I bought it. It broke immediately. The main support piece appears to be metal in the picture, but it is cheap plastic.I returned the piece to be replaced and never heard back.DON'T BUY IT."
1,"After installation, I bumped into the hanger and it broke. The piece that mounts between the headrest supports is plastic and breaks easily. Try to find a unit that has metal components."
1,"I sure wanted to take advantage of a great sale price with this Amazon download version, and my computer runs dozens of games supported on XP (including the 3rd in this Runaway series), but this download would not install. Amazon support walked through it with me, confirmed that upon download the install button didn't work, and gave me the contact info for Pendulo Studios. After Pendulo ignored all requests for help -- they just don't care, I guess -- at least Amazon gave me a refund.I sure would like to start with the first game in this series, but it sounds like others have had some real issues with the DVD version as well -- so, perhaps I'll just ingore Pendulo and their products too from now on."
1,if you like puzzles that make no sense and a slow story that drags itself making no sense at all get this game. The hype is absurd. If you like cartoonish graphics go for the abbey or grim fandango instead..
1,"The antenna came with the unit did not work. Amazon was great in sending the replacement unit. However, the new antenna was also not working. when I used the antenna that came with the XM2go's kit, it did work both times with the AL's docking bases. Good sound, but limited in volume."
1,"I orginally thought it would be great on the deck or just to use when I was outside. This was one of the worst purchases I have ever made. the sound is terrible and my unit was a faded gray. Probably ok for a very small room, like a bathroom or closet. I am very disappointed in this product."
1,"My friend, the KJB has stood the test of time and you can build your life on that Book. You can't do it with the NIV because it contains lies [It makes lucifer the morning star in Isaiah 14, but Jesus is the morning star in Revelation. Sounds like the Gnostics/Alexandrian cult who denied the deity of Jesus had their hand in that]. Also read what Frank Logsdon says about the corrupt NASB and that he distances himself from any involvement with that version. Download 4 reasons for defending the King James Bible by D.A Waite and read the truth for yourself. Buy Sam Gipp ,`The Answers BOOK' and `Thou Shalt Keep Them...' by Corkish and David Sutton."
1,"Just because it's non fiction doesn't mean I can't use my imagination. What made Nina Bernstein think I'd be interested in the exact height, hometown and family tree of every person associated with the Wilder case?The book is written as a narrative which bounces around from one person to another multiple times within chapters which is extremely frustrating. Just as you are getting interested in the story or the course of events she does a quick change to some other character, some of which are not at all interesting. This style is often enjoyable, (mostly in non fiction) but this is not a good application of that method.Aside from my overall frustration with the book it is of course still compelling material. Reading it just feels like wading through a swamp of details.Unfortunately, this book could have easily been half as long and twice as compelling."
1,"ELP are one of my favorite bands, but even I don't have to like this contractual-obligation quickie taped between tanning sessions in the Bahamas. Pete Sinfield's lyrics are good for a laugh, at least, but the biggest one is the front cover photo--did these guys really think they were sex symbols? (It is instructive that Carl Palmer, always the most circumspect member of the group, posed with his shirt buttoned.) It's not all awful--""Canario"" is actually one of ELP's more respectful covers of a classical piece--but ""Brain Salad Surgery"" or ""Tarkus"" cut it to ribbons."
1,"This book did NOT help me at all. It was not specific enough and did not share the the pecs pictures which they use for the training! I was better off going with my gut than trying to follow a book. A child on the spectrum has so many needs, and they are all different."
1,"Perhaps this book is written so conventionally, so sophmorically and so uninspiringly is BECAUSE it was a collaborative effort. I think one writer would have found a more interesting voice than that of this sterotypical nice girl in the big city."
1,"Got this for my Toyota Highlander's back window wiper. It didn't fit and wouldn't go on the wiper arm. When I realized it wouldn't go on, I tried to slide the rubber blade itself off so I could use it as a replacement on the existing wiper. The rubber blade wouldn't come off. Trashed it!"
1,not for the car i searched would not fit was the wrong size for the car it says it was
1,I bought this without realizing what I was getting. This is a product from 1987 and won't work on a Mac OS older than about 1990. I feel I've been taken....but I'm sure I have no legal recourse.
1,"This product is poorly made and not really usable. It should be stated in the purchase area that it is for display only. When I opened the box and tried to snap the sections together, it broke. I ended out throwing the entire box away."
1,"After reading other reviews of this DVD, I was looking forward to something I could really learn something from. I was mistaken. I've played guitar for 30 years and was wanting to add to my blues licks, but Buddy in this video doesn't play very well, and he doesn't even explain much about his technique, or his thinking about how he goes about it. I was a bit disappointed and wished I could return it."
1,"I am not happy with this product. The packaging was damaged and the seat had some dents and discoloration but I decided to live with it ... but now, after only 2 months of use, the lid is coming off the hinge attachments and I can't tighten it because the screwmounts are stripped. This is not something related to installation, it had to have come this way. My old seat was more than 20 years old and looked and worked great but it was the wrong color. This one isn't going to last a year."
1,"I should have listened to the other reviewers, but I just wanted a cheap black toilet seat with Amazon's super saver shipping. After just a few months of normal use, the screws that hold the lid on are falling out and the screw holes are stripped. Oh, well. It looked good for a while."
1,"I ordered 2 white toilet seats, both had slightly different connectors and both seats slide sideways even after retightening the plastic tension nuts. I do not recommend these. I'm sorry I purchased them as they dont stay very well. I thought with the metal attachment bolts they would hold and not move side to side. There should have been better attachment hardware. Update 3-20-09, both seats have broken. On one the plastic bumper under the seat broke and the other totally cracked. The price can easily be beat at Lowes or the Home Depot. I just bought a better fitting seat for 20 dollars."
1,"If you enjoy this ""game"", your IQ is in the single digits. If you realize you've been had and could have had just as much ""fun"" flipping a coin repeatedly, then you may consider yourself to still be a worthy contributor to the gene pool."
1,"Disclaimer: I only read selections from this book!I was interested in looking through this book because 1.) people have told me it is good and 2.) I thought Blue like Jazz was terrible and cannot understand why people like his writting so much. With that in mind I purused a copy of my friends and not surprisingly found it just as underwhelming.The writing is getting better. The ""insights"" into life, while highly personal and occationally compelling, are shallow and obvious. It is like being at a Sunday sermon where the pastor preaches a moving speach, but upon reflection you realize it was just another homily.Spend the time you would be reading this book doing something much more constructive - like reading and reflecting on the bible itself."
1,i kept getting the butt side confused with the face side. now my face kind of smells. thank you for attention to this matter.p.s. be sure to read the instructions.
1,"THIS TOWEL IS TOTAL BOOTY & FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!!!! From the photo, you would think that this was a HUGE PLUSH BEACH SIZED TOWEL of HEAVY WEIGHT.... THINK AGAIN!!!!!From what was delivered, I can tell that photo enhancement was the order of the day. This towel was just about PAPER THIN mad from the CHEAPEST of RAG TERRY CLOTH and is ONLY AS LARGE AS A HAND TOWEL AT BEST.BUYER BEWARE.... or you will have your FACE crying in the BUTT part of this item! LOL"
1,The towel is very thin and not very good quality. I was very disappointed with this purchase it was a gift for my son. Picture online looks great product sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,This toy is very difficult to put together and is too hard for a young child to manipulate. It is made out of shoddy material and is very flimsy. The pieces are too difficult to put together and is uneven when put together. I feel that I have wasted $20 and wish that I had spent a little more on a higher quality marble run.
1,"I bought this set and was not happy with it. I found it scratches easily and I am not using plastic utensils when I cook! I sent back one set which was found to be faulty, and was sent a new set only to have two of the lids valves not to work at all-- couldn't open or close them. Sent that set back too. Now I'm out over $60. shipping and nothing to show for it."
1,"I got this for my son. He hated the taste, texture, smell and most of all his teeth and tongue were left bright green even after brushing with regular tooth paste!"
1,"After 3 days of having this controller, it already started to have problems. The docking station would not pick up charges from the battery anymore making my controller useless. For the amount of money I spent, I am very disappointed."
1,"bought this particular item from another website. should've checked out amazon's reviews first. like everyone else, i received a defective battery. i actually shipped the gamepad back and got a replacement from the vendor. and the replacmenet sucks just as bad.while the batteries seems to work, the gamepad has massive calibration problems, even with Saitek's recommended fixes. it takes me about five minutes of fiddling around the analog sticks, unplugging/replugging the batteries, for it to work properly. i've only had it (the second gamepad) for a few weeks, and it only seems to get worse.this is the worst product i've ever bought, and i will never buy a product from Saitek again.(btw, if you include the return shipping charges, i've spent over fifty dollars on this gamepad. last week, circuit city had a rebate for it to make it less than twenty total. hey saitek - you suck!)i strongly urge amazon to discontinue carrying this product."
1,"Not really worth it at all! I wasted 1/4 of a Swedish Firesteel trying to get some of it to burn. And that was in perfect conditions in my garage at home. Cotton balls work better, and they're A LOT cheaper! I will never purchase it again."
1,"What an incredible disappointment. Typos galore, and answers that do not match up with the questions (#66-68)are just a couple reasons NOT to buy this book. Here's what you need to know about the Praxis: 150 questions, 2 hours, less than one minute per question (so manage your time), you need a scaled score of about 60% to pass...that's roughly 95 questions correct out of 150. Study your Neuro, speech science, anatomy, hearing aids. If you're desperate, get a bunch of students together and buy one copy of this book to share. What a waste of money. :("
1,"Did not connect very well with theological studies for me. Also, without some significant biographical, historical and philosophical context on the writers themselves, it was hard to be able to put the writings in perspective. Better to read from an original translation of the philosopher's work than to take out of context. Need at least a couple of courses in philosophy prior to tackling something like this. Admittedly the readings were easier to work with than the ""Philosophy for Understanding Theology"" which this volume was intended to supplement."
1,"This book was horribly written, it drags on to no climax. The characters seemed faceless and immature. The main character needs to get a life! Waste of $$"
1,"After buying several radios to keep the shop connected we found that the battery life lasted less than a few transmissions. I contacted the company, Uniden, and was told by custy service to write a letter and fax it to there service dept. I was told that the batteries must be bad and should be warrenteed. I faxed the letter with proof of purchase and serial numbers and didn't receive any acknowledgement. So I did it again. I have waited and tried for six months. Although I have had confidence in Uniden (only because my very first cordless home phone was Uniden)in the past I will never buy their products again and advice you not to."
1,Returned because it doesn't come near fitting...Many other brand bras fit in the exact same size. And it is not the cup...it is the chest measurement.
1,I really liked the bra but it didn't fit me right. The cups fit but it was too tight by the arms...will be returning
1,"This bra is definitely not for those of us with ""bigger girls"". It creates some type of strange uni-boob and does not flatter what-so-ever. The lining in it is also uncomfortable."
1,I was in the market for a new vac & have had 2 of these with extreme delight in the past 16 years. This one came broken and much to my disappointment I will not get another one. The factory non-800 phone line would not send me another belt to fix the one I received(already broken). They only said send it back or take it 25 miles to the service center. I will be buying something else.
1,"I used this vacuum just twice when the beater bar froze. Problem was, the 30 day return to Amazon had expired because I went on extended vacation (I expressly bought from Amazon because of this and thought I would be better protected). They refused to help beyond answering my initial email to tell me they wouldn't help!From now on, I'll be purchasing items such as this from a local merchant (Wal*Mart) who will repair or replace.:-("
1,"Well, I never read the book but what all reviews are true. Ankit Fadia is nothing but a charlatan. He claims to be a hacker but can't write or read code, never found a bug and maybe had never exploited a system in his whole life.I was reading a commentary by a guy in India who saw a presentation by Mr. Ankit and he said Fadia didn't show up anything new or valuable on it -- he showed how easy is to break into a computer using NetBus (haha!) and lots of outdated crap.Looking at the latest review I saw the phrase ""The only difficulty in reading this book is that the C code cannot be easily understood by newbies."" Yeah man, and it's even more difficult to Fadia because he can't code a single line of code."
1,"This is an inferior product. I mean really inferior. Irregular, dusty chips. Dirty fingerprints; they seemed manually packed in very bad conditions. Cheap aluminium case. *Do not* make this a present to anyone, it will be an embarrassment. While the seller refunded me for the product, I didn't get a refund for shipping -- which is more than half of the product cost.I wish I can recommend you where to go for a good chip set. Tried other vendors and got the same kind of junk. I suspect most those chips come from a common source. Some companies sent me samples; then when the order arrived nothing looked like the samples. I was duped."
1,"I was looking for a good mystery. This story is primarily about a young chef's experience with the mob. The environment is more New Jersey ""Goodfellas"" than a kitchen. Mob pressure , crime and threats were not what I hoped to find in the story."
1,"My 14 month old girl received this for Christmas from an aunt. In the box it looked like fun, and my baby was excited to get it open. Once it was opened, the fun lasted for 15 seconds and it was on to another toy. She will play with it once a day for 20 seconds or less because it has very little to do that is new to her. I would not recommend this at all because it seems to be a waste of space. I would recommend The Little People doll house for 1+ age catagory. My daughter plays with that constantly."
1,"Some time ago I wrote a review for a different product that used peek-a-blocks explaining that these blocks are UNSAFE for children learning to stand. Our son was injured falling face-first onto a peek-a-block when he was learning to stand. He was 8 months old at the time. There is a small space between the clear plastic faces of the blocks and the colored framing where the edges are SHARP, and if your child happens to fall onto a block, he or she could be injured on these sharp edges. We had to take our son to the emergency room to have DermaBond applied to the injury (it looked like it needed stitches), and he now has a permanent scar above his upper lip, below his nose as a result of peek-a-blocks.Test them for yourself if you ever see them in a store. Press on the space between the two surfaces, and you will be able to feel just how sharp these edges are. These blocks, in my opinion, should only be used for older children - if at all."
1,"This was fun for a (very) little while, but my son quickly grew bored with it. A lot of money, and a bulky toy, for something that doesn't capture their interest for too long."
1,"I bought this for my 10 month old son, and he did not play with it. He held the blocks, and then would turn to his Leap Frog Learning Table for more fun. I returned the Incrediblock and purchased the Laugh and Learn Learning Home for $10.00 more. He loves the Learning Home, and he plays with it non-stop. The peek a blocks were cool, but the Incrediblock was just not fun. The sound was not loud enough and the motor on top was too loud. It was just boring!"
1,I don't think the technology is there yet for using LED's in a floodlight format
1,"Sizes for grill grates would allow viewers to measure and choose. After 2 years I do not have the box, {didnt keep it} or the model number of my New Braunfels smoker. Leangth x width is all we need to choose proper grates. Thankyou"
1,The Doodle Pro Basic is GREAT. This one (Little People) is not.Here's why:* Magnets in the shape stampers are so strong my son could not get the shapes out of their resting spots.* The pen tip is so short you have to write holding the pen at an exact 90 degree angle to the board.* The string that attaches the pen to the board does not move very freely.* The eraser (sliding soccer ball) is so hard to move that my son cannot move it.* Little Eddie's foot and one of the balloons takes up some of the drawing area.[...]
1,"After trying unsuccessfully to get the ear piece to stay on my ear, I gave up and returned the unit to Amazon."
1,Are these written by the companies who make the products? They certainly do not read like profesional reviews. Tons of typos throughout. This book claims to be a source of saving money. I'd like to see statistics on how much money the average readers saves because of her advice.
1,"Hey Plum: I see what you mean! These people and their cult can't accept a bad review. No one needs to pay for a book to decide what high chair is best for them.Doesn't anyone have common sense, read Consumer Reports or read the labels? I mean come on..are you telling me a new mom is so irresponsible that she does not even take the time to learn the brands of baby items she is investing in.I think these authors are scam artists and I'm contacting the FTC. I know other people who have reported them. The more requests they get, the quicker an investigation into this pay for play little scam."
1,"This book should be a bestseller - to every journalism school as a case study of ""when good journalists become bad authors"". It reads like a collected series of author notes strung badly together. This writer should have never ventured past his skill set.Page after page of detailed notes about chemical and optical process (more than likely lifted straight out of someone's lab notebooks) without a SINGLE diagram. None, zero, zilch. Can you imagine an entire book on Poloroid without a single explanatory diagram?!In a potentially gripping human story there are no insights about the classic American conflict of what happens to an entrepreneur and his company when he misses the next market. No depth of character.I forced myself to finish the book. Learned some interesting outlines of Land's life. It could have be covered in a New Yorker article.Worthwhile bibliography - most of the insights were from these source materials."
1,"*Everybody* loves this film. I don't get it. While I love both main actors, the music is good, and the film is nicely shot, I found it to be pretty much just a story of a man who can't keep his paws out of the cookie box. (Drugs and cheating on his wife.) I tried watching it three times, but finally I just gave up, it just did not hold my interest."
1,"I bought this for 60.00 thinking it would be good for my 15.4 VAIO laptop. Once you put your laptop in there....forget about trying to put anything else in this bag. I had enough of a hard time zipping the bag closed with just the laptop, let alone trying to add the power cord in the separate front pocket. Nice idea...with the memory foam, but too tight, and too much fighting to zip and unzip because the bag doesn't keep its shape. The ""hard"" shell started to curve in and it just made it that much more difficult to get my laptop in and out. I returned it and went with Matias Laptop Armor instead."
1,"Another book by Koontz that has once again given reason to why I dislike most of his writing. Once and awhile, he pulls out a winner, but this, sadly, is not it.He takes a seemingly interesting premise, that of a dopple-ganger terrorizing a family, and kills it. The characters are flat, all too perfect, and lack any developement. Like in many of his books, Koontz pulls out the genetic, government-created killing-machine as the answer to the villain of the book.It worked in 'The Watchers', but not here. It seems the man has to do something like this in a lot of his work just so he can pull out a rant about how humans shouldn't 'play God' and about how screwed up humanity is.Several, and in my opinion better, Koontz books include the Odd Thomas and Frankenstein series, 'Life Expectancy', 'Intensity', and, of course, 'The Watchers'. But this is definately not a book I will read again."
1,"Martin Stillwater is a mystery novelist with a wife who is a psychologist and two daughters. There is somebody else out there who is a killer . . . who could that be? They want to take over Marty's life and identity . . . They want what Marty has . . . Could that be Marty himself or somebody else? I will not tell you the answers, but I could not wait until I found out for myself.Anyway, the storyline was a pretty good idea. However, I didn't like the writing style. A lot of unnecessary detail and rambling on made this book tiring.I won't say more about this book, because I don't want to give it away. But, however, I wouldn't recommend it. Even if you like the author. I like a different book by this author, but this book wasn't as good."
1,"This is not Koontz's best work by far. As usual, Koontz uses his traditional tried but true plot line that comes close to being remarkable as Kafka and Phillip K Dick, only to slip into politically correct mushiness. This book could be viewed as a Christian inspirational text rather than a horror novel. It is always fun to start Koontz's novels because the ideas are strong as always. But it just doesn't follow through with any originality. ""Fear nothing,"" and ""Seize the Night,"" and ""Intensity,"" are my favorite Koontz novels, and would recommend these before `Mr. Murder.' This isn't his worst novel; it just jellies into a pile of sameness with the rest of his gibberish."
1,I was very disappointed with Marco Perella's book. I read alot of hollywood biographies and books about film making. I think I expected a little more substance. The stories that he shared about working with certain actors were boring. I could not tell if he purposely left out the behind the scenes anecdotes or he was so far down on the pecking order that he did not really have any real experiences to share. I would not recommend this book.
1,"Viewed: 3/09Rate: 23/09: So, where is the controversy? Nothing seems to happen in ...And God Created Woman. Where is the nudity? Jeez, what a crock waste of time. Brigitte Bardot teases her way through ...And God Created Woman and never takes off her clothes. So much for anticipation. Tell me again the reason why the movie was made in the first place. All in all, the only thing that saved ...And God Created Woman is the nice cinematography of Saint Tropez."
1,"As a writer of erotic fiction, I have been influenced by a number of films, one of which is this classic. Bardot is beautiful, sexy, and literally a symbol of sexual desire. If you love erotica, check this film out."
1,"If you're already well acquainted with the life and works, I suppose you might find this book charming. You'd already have to have read a real biography of Wodehouse, like McCrum's, to make any use of it. Like many other books touted as biographies, it's really a fan's notes and opinions -- gabby, dotty, discursive, heavily slanted and defensive, often frustratingly vague. Donaldson knew Wodehouse and had access to his papers, so she could have written the definitive bio. She wrote nothing remotely like it."
1,"Apparently this model and several other HP printers have a fatal flaw - at some point one color or another no longer prints. For me it was black.I tried replacing the black cartridge several times -- using HP-brand cartridges mind you -- and although they were detected and indicated as full, black still wouldn't print. No problem with the other colors, but what use is a printer that doesn't print black?I contacted HP support and after running me through steps I had already taken - rebooting the printer, cleaning the heads, rebooting again, etc - was told that I could get a discount on a new printer. Sound familiar?Why would I buy another printer from HP when this one stopped working for no apparent reason?I had no issues with this printer until now. I'm truly disappointed."
1,"The product that I got was unable to print text. It scanned negatives and pictures fine and the printed pictures came out fine. However, it was unable to print an MS Word document correctly. I spent an entire day speaking to HP tech support in India and was told that there was an issue with my router. I was forced to purchase a USB cable (for some reason it was optional on this printer) and the problem did not go away."
1,I'm not a heavy printer and this thing is already broken--ink system failure. Junky product. I would not recommend this product or any other HP product.
1,"I even put sprinkles on top but my kids wouldn't eat these. I knew when the batter didn't even taste good and they didn't want to lick the spoon we were in trouble. I didn't like them, either. Very gritty and just don't taste good."
1,The only way to turn this off is to remove the battery. Keeps terrible time--what a piece of junk! Please don't buy this thinking something new will work great--it doesn't!
1,"We have a 10 year old cat who is extremely finicky and he absolutely, positively would not even taste this. We tried many different ways (going through several cans) including just a teaspoon full with his normal canned food and he would take one sniff and walk away. We were very disappointed because we had read several great reviews. The company was wonderful and are allowing us to return the rest of the cans (we bought an entire case). So, only buy a few cans at first to see if your cat will eat this. On the other hand, we also bought the dry kibble made by Instinctive Choice and my cat LOVES this. Go figure."
1,"The only ""power"" the Bible gives to Christian women is the ""power"" to say ""Yes sir"" to their owners, I mean husbands.When will people see that we're all equal?"
1,"I bought several of these frames and I had a lot of prints to frame and like d the clean lines, and low cost.I really like the look of floating glass frames, and it provides more options for your photos or art.The problem with these frames is that like many things made in China, they are cheap...at great cost.The glass broke from the pressure of putting those little tabs that hold it together down, and (as someone who works with glass) I know that this type of break only occurs in glass which is not properly annealed.What does this mean to you? It is DANGEROUS!!! A product like this should be made with either safety glass, hard glass (pyrex, borosilicate) or, at the very least, properly annealed soft glass (actually any & all of these glasses should be annealed to remove stress)...but, without getting too technical- all I can say is that the glass in this product is unsuitable for it's purpose, and fundamentally unsafe."
1,"I purchased this item on 9/30/10. It is now 11/5/10 and I still have not recieved it. I have already made two requests to cancel the purchase, but they refused to do so by responding with a fake ups codes. I am very disappointed in their service and responsibility to their customers."
1,"Bought this and the one with the bristles to go outside Side entrance for all to use before entering. Trouble is, both are tiny, not weighted well and no one seems be able to clean shoes with either one, they just fall over. After three months making matters worse, this one began to rust. One more thing, the bristle one- that is to say, the Scotty dog is larger, it is not just the bristles making it appear larger - so they don't coordinate as well as I hoped. I had planned to sink in some concrete to try and stabilize but with the rust now being a problem, think I may just pitch. Learning curve, hope my experience helps others avoid spending good money badly."
1,"I have been buying these before (from Microcenter). They are very cheap and I thought it was a very good deal. Particularly their 2600mAh for 4 for 5 bucks! But...Cons:-Of all the NiMh batteries I tried. This has the most number of failures. Some just dies. Some would hold very low charges after just a few cycles.-It is bigger in circumference compared to other batteries. Which will not fit some of my cameras and gadgets.-Exterior is made of paper and gets easily smashed, deformed.Pros:-Price. but for this kind of quality... not worth it.Also: With all the new low discharge batteries flooding the market (Eneloops, Rayovacs, Duracell, Kodak, etc.) There is no longer any reason to buy this kind of batteries. Even this company is now manufacturing their own Hybrio."
1,"Have had this watch for less than a month, and it loses 5-10 minutes a day. Additionally it loses about 2 days per week on the date. I never considered that it wouldn't work and threw away the box when I got it.After being late for a couple meetings and flat out having the wrong date on one occasion, I'm pitching this and looking for a non-Timex.I've worn Timex watches since I was a boy, and since I now work outside, I go through one every couple years before they need replaced. I'll be looking for something else."
1,"Very disappointed that this product is not as advertised. It does not have any insulated thermal characteristics on the reservoir as claimed and it definitely does have a hot plate that scorches the coffee flavor contrary to advertisement. On the plus side, it does brew good coffee and tastes great but only if you serve it fresh."
1,i loved this thing until the seal went at month 7. really? 7 months is all i get for $54.
1,"My daughter-in-law had specifically wanted a pink and purple toolbox for Christmas. I just received it in the mail, and I can't beging to tell you how disappointed I am. The first thing I noticed when I opened it was the bottom of the case was very scratched up, then I noticed one of the latches was missing. When I opened it, the handles of the tools were scratched up, the case was old and scratched, it was clearly not new, as was shown when I ordered it. As a matter of fact, I have a set of tools that I have used for years that look better than this. I can't beleive any company would send this out and expect any type of customer satisfaction. I would be embarrased to give it as a gift. Of course it is only a few days before Christmas, so now I'm off to see what I can find locally. I would suggest that nobody order this, because it's clear to me that this company wants your money, but does care about customer satisfaction."
1,"Horrible. It's the only word that can describe this book. It's clear the author interviewed a significant number of people researching this book, but who cares if there is NOTHING compelling to read after the interviews are done. No really, this is the worst book I have ever read. I love Jimi's music, which brought me to the book, but this book does nothing but chronicle his life via patched together anectdotes. There's no insight, no summarized thoughts - just a BORING listing of trivial events. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. Just keep listening to his music!!"
1,"I love almost anything Monty Python, so I was thrilled when this version of The Life of Brian came out. Especially after seeing the Eric Idle/John DuPre production of Spamalot. I knew going into this that it was an oratorio and therefore not theatricalized, but wow... never, I repeat NEVER send in an opera singer to do a comedic actors job!!! They do what they do and beautifully. But all humor is lost in this staid production. So sad. I hope that Mssrs. Idle and DuPre can find a more joyful expression of this brilliant original story."
1,"The bezel on the watch is described as ""unidirectional"" WRONG. The bezel does not rotate period, if you need this feature buy another watch because this one does not have it. To add insult to injury the battery died less than two months after purchase, in a word this watch is junk."
1,"I bought this case the same day i bought my ipod about six months ago and as soon as i got the ipod i put it in the casewithin a month there was noticeable scratches (i never took it out) and within 3 months there was a huge area of scratches around the click wheel. i decided to go back to the default cheap skin that apple gives you with the ipod, and that has protected it BETTER the last three months! There are only a few more scratches that occured while i had it out of the white caseDON'T BUY"

1,The book makes sence. I read the Neale Walsh books also and I just feel that the Jeffrey character took things into his own hands that he should not have. The book seems to promote that and I find that disturbing. I feel that the author has good potential however maybe he should reconsider his methods.
1,"At first i was excited to have my own shock pen. I tricked my friends pretty good,but the batteries died after 3 days of use, and eventually the pen just fell apart."
1,"I received this as a Christmas present and it is obvious that this was a refurbished product. The box was beat up and the product does not work as advertised. The clock does not auto set, the volume for the radio does not make any difference (always at Maximum), finally the alternative alarm with a beep is very faint so you do not hear it. While this might have been a decent product at some point what I received was junk and from this experience I would never buy anything from discount jungle."
1,"Was so excited to get this today. Just plugged it in and the date, time and day of the week is wrong. I'm in eastern time zone. It was suppose to automatically set to correct date, time, etc. today is 11/03 Saturday. It set for 03/15 1:00. I tried to change the time zone but the button does not work. Complete dud! Very disappointed!!!!"

1,"This movie was not what I expected at all. It is very slow-paced. Maybe I just didn't ""get"" it, but I found it extremely boring and didn't even finish the movie. I'm sorry I added it to my wish list! I thought after hearing the very positive reviews and seeing who was in the cast that it would be worth my time, but I was wrong. Don't waste your time watching this film!"
1,"Cinematicly, well done photography.Plot wise, After watching other shows and seeing what was cut out to make the movie move along, their cuts were better than this ordeal."
1,Ok... First off I don't usually write reviews.The good: I agree with what a lot of the other posters wrote. It was a beautiful movie. The acting was ok... If you like long slow glares with few words...The Bad: Oh my god was this a slow movie. There was way to much time to enjoy the scenery and costumes. About half way through I was bored out of my mind. Then when I thought it was over (ok given the title I don't think this is much of a surprise but just in case spoiler alert) When they finally got around to killing Jessie James I wanted to cry. They dragged this scene out at least 10 minutes to long. But I was happy. I thought it was over... Then (spoiler alert #2) I found out the depths of my error... There was at least another 30-40 minutes of the movie... Yeash if it hadn't been for free and I was trying to fall asleep anyway I wouldn't have bothered.ps: The two stars is only because it was a pretty movie.
1,"I recently rented this movie thinking I was going to see a little suspense and western culture, instead what I got was sleepy. The movie moves too slowly to keep any interest and the constant narrative does not help almost each scene is narrated which takes away any of the suspense between Ford and James. If the director knew how to make a captivating movie, he would have cut out all that narrative and instead told a story through actions, not through words. Casey Affleck's performance as Robert Ford is very good but it is not enough to save this movie from being pretty boring."

1,I hate this bra. The elastic band is NOT soft and rolls up as the day wears on. Shoulder straps are skinny & inadequate. Only good thing is that it is low-cut. I prefer my $12 nursing bras purchased at Wal-Mart. I only wear this one if those are unavailable or my shirt is low-cut.
1,Jones has riveting material to work with but she shows little insight into what motivates any of the people she writes about. She trots out the usual cliches about unhappy childhoods and sexual abuse but she does not persuade the reader that these events shaped her characters in any particular way.The banality of her prose and the remarkable number of typos added to my disappointment with this book. Did no one edit this book?
1,"I have been researching the story myself and am disturbed by the tone that Aphrodite lets seep into her narrative voice. At times, Jones lets the sentiments of characters like Nissen and Lotter seep into her own voice and her short and coded diatribe against the gay and lesbian acitivists who rallied together after Brandon's death does nothing to highlight the issue of what to call Brandon. Sorry, Aphrodite, it's about respect, not martyrdom. If you have any sort of allegiance to gay/lesbain/transgender causes and desire a greater understanding of transgender issues, then borrow this book if you must read it. Check it out from the library -- don't contribute money to someone who spends 317 pages without really trying to understand the dilemna really at the heart of this story."
1,I know that the murder was true but the people that they arrested were not true. Tom is one of them who did but John Lotter did not. If the author would have told you the first word after Tom was arrested she would have told that Tom said Lanna was with him. Then later changed his story. I think if you are going to write a book you should find out the truth first. Yes John was arrested by he is now appealing it. Because of the first words out of Tom's mouth......
1,"My first one arrived broken. A replacement came. It's OK, but the CD player engine makes too much hiss. And setting the time isn't intuitive.If I had it to do over again, I'd spend a little more and get something better."
1,"When this show first came out I really liked this show. Not since ""Columbo"" has TV given us a crime show without the blood & guts, sex & violence garbage and trying to masquerade it as ""realism."" Tony Shaloub is one talented man.However, since losing Bitty Schram, this show has lost its fire. Her replacement comes off like a shrill soccermom and she lacks the sexiness (and bootyliciousness I might add) that Shram brought to this show."

1,"This is the top-of-the-line recorder and I was a little disappointed.Pros:sufficient recording time (havent tested that).Cons:1. I am very surprised that they forgot to add a DC-in jack, which means you must always use AAA batteries even when near a power supply! A DC-input jack is a given on all electronic items!!2. avg. recording quality. Mono recording with some echo when recording lectures.3. One of the adverts clearly said transfer to/from PC. I was surprised to find the manual says otherwise. You cannot upload from PC to recorder. Was it too difficult to implement?"
1,"This has a known problem if your system is Windows XP. It may work for one day and then stop working. Will get an error that says 'Device cannot start. Code 10'. Belkin will replace it without asking very many questions. If I could give this zero stars, that's what I would give it. Don't buy this."
1,"I guess I thought that I could eliminate cupcake or muffin papers and that the flexible nature of the silicone pan would aid in easy removal.. Not so. My cupcakes stuck and broke apart when I tried to remove them, even though I sprayed them with cooking spray first.I have looked at the new silicone bakeware products for a while and assumed that something new would be an improvement. No so, in my opinion. The cupcakes didn't brown as they do in metal pans. This goes out in my next yardsale."
1,"I'm so glad I bought this used for $2 vs. new. It looks cool, and the Kitchenaid brand was a plus. Muffins and cupcakes don't brown like they should. The texture and crumb are different. The pan doesn't effect taste luckily. Storage is a problem. Using non-stick sprays leaves a sticky finish to the muffin pan eventually that does not come off in the dishwasher - which would also happen with some metal cupcake or cake pans as well. I do not recommend this at all. If anyone wants to pay shipping, they can have my pan! I'll stick to metal pans."
1,"I guess some babies love this mat, but mine could not have cared less. The toys that hung from it did not interest them. I hung the Tiny Love Trio of toys from it, too, but they were bored by all of it. I'm glad it was a gift and that I did not pay for it myself, because I got very little use out of it."
1,"Well I have to say our son really did not like this toy. He thought it was very boring. Recently I hung all the other toys like a rattle etc. from it and then he liked it. But still is not interested at all in the toys it originally came with.The toy actually has one plus, it folds up nice in is very easy to take along."
1,"Maybe my daughter is still too young to enjoy this award winning toy, I find it just too plian and not very inspiring for babies. It comes with three attachments and you would have to buy more if you like to add a little more variety to your baby's enjoyment. I think the attachments cost about $5.00 each. Anyway, bottomline is, I think the fundamental value of this toy is very low and will not contribute much to your baby's development. (What's more, it's very expensive!)"
1,ordered this $550.00+ advertised target from Mudd Creek for $9.92 dollar advertised price feeling I was in for some great deal. Recieved a piesce of cardboard with a very elementary drawing of a deer and it's supposed anatomy. False advertising and less than quality products are not what I expected from this advertisement. I'm not sure how Amazon deals with this but it was listed as a 95% favorable company. Bullshit.Delta Cardboard Deer Target
1,"The one surprising thing about this book is the skill with which the author manages to fit in every possible gender stereotype from the fifties and still have it published in the nineties. If you're looking for sexist jokes on how the baby will ruin both your sex life and your golf game, then this book may be for you. If you're looking for advice on how to be a good dad and support your partner through a very demanding time, then you're better off looking elsewhere."
1,"I got this for my husband, and he only read a couple of chapters and quit. When I asked him why, he said that it didn't tell him anything he already didn't know. He said it was a waste of money."
1,"This CD was so cold I needed to put on 'Can't Buy a Thrill' to warm up. I really wanted to go on Amazon.com and write a great review, but then after listening to the CD on a long road trip, I can safely say that it is not good. I was really anticipating the arrival of the next Steely Dan recording, however, this was a major disappointment, especially because their ""sound"" was so distinct and sincerely sleazy (the way I like it). To be constructively critical, there is no warmth whatsoever. Put Aja on and then put this on. You can totally tell a difference in the recording - both stylistic and in the audio. Very dry and too digital. I'm sorry, guys."
1,"The detached coolness, sophistication, and introspection of ""Aja,"" ""Katy Lied,"" and ""Pretzel Logic"" are supplanted by jokey lyrics set to purposefully (needlessly?) labyrinthine melodies with high-school stage band-caliber horn charts. Those who swoon that the songs of ""TAN"" represent the ""natural evolution"" of Steely Dan have very low standards/expectations indeed, and would probably eagerly purchase ""Steely Dan Sings the Best of Fatboy Slim"" with the same abandonment of their critical faculties. Becker + Fagen are ideally positioned, as middle-aged men, to produce music that is genuinely reflective of the ennui and angst that was presaged by ""Aja."" Instead, ""TAN"" is a massive betrayal of unique talents. The result is endlessly disappointing, uninvolving, shimmery-gorgeous piffle."
1,"As an avid Steely Dan fan who owns a large collection of their CD's, I think this is too much of the same. Most dissapointing, after such a long wait. Lacking in energy and new ideas."
1,"Being a devoted Steely Dan fan and looking forward to the new recording, I found it uninspiring. All of the selections have that familiar Becker and Fagen sound and lyrical satire but the songs are devoid of any expressed musical feeling. As I listened through the CD, I did not find one tune that ever got further than the starting gate. There is a chrome polished (weak) groove to each song but polish alone will not take the listener anywhere.Technically the recording sounds very very digital dry. It is very clean but lacks the life and especially the breath and depth of previous Steely Dan recordings. The sound is tight, overly controlled and in a word, dark.We Dan fans can all hope that someday Becker and Fagen will get back to the passion of the music that once gave us ""the chills"" while listening."
1,"I really had high expectations for this album, and I really wanted to like it. After a listen to the full disk, all I can say is if McDonalds made music, this is what it would sound like.The trademark Steely Dan sound is certainly there, and the performances and production are top notch. But to me, these are just throwaways, filler tracks that have little passion or adventure, and probably wouldn't even make it on an earlier album.I guess it's true that all good things eventually come to an end. RIP Steely Dan."
1,"I personally have never understood the appeal of bands such as Steely Dan, Boston, Chicago, etc. A musican friend of mine told me to give Steely Dan a try. In his opinion Donald Fagen is one of the most gifted musicians around. Well upon one listen of this CD I knew my worst fears would be confirmed. There is nothing ""new"" about this compilation. It is as derivative as anything else done by this less than mediocore band. If you really want to hear a quality CD try Van Morrison's Astral Weeks or the quintessential Blood on the Tracks by Bob Dylan. Your money will be better spent."
1,Why buy this CD when you can just telephone the dentist's office and be put on hold. It's pretty much the same--just a whole lot cheaper.
1,This product does not work. It does not keep time. I have kissed 35.00 (plus 7.00 to get it fitted) away and tossed this POS in the garbage.DO NOT BUY THIS!!!
1,My daughter is a huge Blue's Room fan and we thought this toy was a great gift for her. We were very wrong! You have to push the pen VERY hard to get it to even draw on the super small space. The paw that slides to erase the board isn't very easy to move either which adds to her frustration. The toy also hasn't held up very well with the little play it's had. IT really wasn't worth the money spent on it!
1,This book is very disorganize. The exercise at the end of each chapter has nothing to do with the chapter itself. It almost seems like the exercise came from a different book. I bought it because it's a class requirement.
1,"Thought my DVD recorder on my computer was broken but once I tried media other than Fuji I was fine. Same experience with my Sony camcorder using Fuji Hi-8 media. DO NOT USE FUJI MEDIA. From what I have read the main issue is that Fuji media has ""aging"" problems so you may be OK when you first buy a spindle of DVD-Rs but six months down the road you might have trouble - that was my experience."
1,"This thing fit perfectly EXCEPT on my back....it rolls down my back like sweat.I really wanted to have a full out love affair with the product, but it's so uncomfortable on my upper back that I just cant. If I went up an additional size it'd be too large everywhere else. I like the fact that it's smooth in the front, opposed to my other product which snaps in the front (which allows u to see through tighter fitting clothes).I think I'll focus more on losing these 10 extra lbs in the gym before I focus on finding another good fitting waist control device....I'm glad that many of the others reviewers have found satisfaction in this item, as I have only discovered a black miraclesuite size medium disappointment..."
1,"My kitchen is entirely Kitchenaid, so I was very excited when Kitchenaid released their silicone bakeware line. I love the color and the way they clean up very nicely. I also love that they do not get scratched or clank around in my cupboards. However, I have noticed that when I bake in these, I can smell the silicone. It even dominates over the smell of the cake or bread that I am making! I have also noticed (especially with this bread pan) that the silicone gives your dessert a slight silicone taste. I own the muffin pans, so I use paper baking cups to prevent this from happening, but with the loaf pan, there is no way around it."
1,"I was disappointed in this product. I know the silicone bakeware is floppy and assumed the sled would support it, but it didn't. The baking pan slipped right through the sled, curling the sides of the pan up. I resorted to using the baking pan without the sled on a cookie sheet, which worked ok, but again the floppiness of the pan made loaf removal a challenge."
1,"Just as some other reviewers said, these are way too tight. There is no way to adjust them not to be tight. The coil will pull your computer before it stretches, and I am afraid to pre-stretch for fear of it snapping because it is so stiff. The volume control is just awful. There is a switch on each ear and turning the volume down on one side will move that volume to the other ear, rather than actually turning it down in both ears. To turn down the volume, you have to turn both knobs simultaneously. Finally, I get fuzzy sounds sometimes depending on how I turn the headphones after first use, which will only exacerbate as time goes on.Final review: Not recommended."
1,"This book is Hamlet without the Prince. The first and most important thing to understand about Chiapas is the tremendous increase in population it has had in the last fifty years. Yet this book never comes to grips with the question of how people are to live today when they are many times more numerous than fifty years ago, and at that time they barely eked out a living. It's too bad that the INI didn't start out with birth control measures when it started work over 50 years ago. If Collier had had a co-author skilled in demography and economics to supplement his own first hand knowledge of the last fifty years in the Chiapas highlands, this could have been a very rewarding book. But as it stands, particularly in the later chapters, there is too much ""anti-globalony""."
1,"8GB Ep Memory Mini Flash Drive USB 2.0 performs more like an old USB 1.0. Files that unzip in seconds in other drives now take minutes. Defraginging the drive with just 200MB has gone from 5 to 10 seconds in other drives to 5 to 10 minutes. I am happy with the greater storage capacity, however I would not have purchased this drive if I had known how slow it is."
1,"I have used this flash drive only a handful of times before it wouldn't work. Needless to say I lost all of the data I had on it. I tried several different computers to no avail. I tried to reformat it and it seems to work ok, however I can't trust that it won't crash again. Maybe it was a defective drive but my rating is based on my experience with the product."
1,Never could figure what the book was about so gave up on it. I know its not about the weather. Save your time.
1,"I ordered a book on March 14 for a birthday present. Today is April 16 and I still have not received the book. I have contacted the dealer twice, but the dealer did not respond to either email. I have also filed a claim because my credit card was charged for the book. If you actually want to buy something at Amazon, do not attempt to buy from Vertex. The worst dealer ever!!Zero stars!"
1,"This product is the worst floor cleaner. It leaves a milky white residue that takes multiple cleanings to remove. Try vinegar. It's cheap, safe, and if you don't like the results, there is no ""process"" to remove."
1,"We got this from set of our parents who said it was one of the best books they read. With that hearty recommendation we jumped in and read in bed in turns (evenings, Sunday afternoons). We talked about the first couple of chapters and were trying to figure out why we were given the book. The more we read the more confused we were and even though we skimmed the rest of the book, we quit after about page 50. I just have to presume that if this book is meant to heal relationships then our relationship as a married couple is pretty good because we had trouble finding application to any of it. Granted, we don't have teenagers yet! To those who read this who have read the book and want to give it as a gift, think twice about what you're conveying when you think of giving it as a gift to someone you love. (They may think you gave it to them because ""they have issues"".)"
1,"I now have purchased about 200 art instruction books and it amazes me at how many just rehash the same old thing (color wheel, red & green makes gray, use round brushes #4,8,12, etc, etc, etc. The first 2/3rds of the book are wasted on this common stuff found in so many previous books. The demonstrations are nice and well explained but that is all I could take out of this book. If your a beginner then you probably will get more out of this book. If you're a more discerning artist, try David Curtis' new book that talks more about the subtleties of painting, like lost and found edges, etc."
1,"I really wanted to like this book and I probably would have if Corisande Easton had not been such an unpleasant heroine. She was a miserable character and I kept hoping she'd change. If she did, it wasn't quickly enough for me. I put it down about three-quarters of the way through."
1,"I'm sorry to disappoint, but I have just compared an official transparency from the National Gallery of Art to its reproduction in the 1997 edition, which I carefully tracked down based on the preceding reviews, and the color is way off. Unfortunately it is very difficult to find accurate color representations of art, and even harder to find a trustworthy source. If you are looking for something very specific, I would suggest contacting the museum where your particular painting resides. Best of luck!"
1,"we bought these for our 3 year old son, and the poor quality of the wiring broke in about a week. If your child is active, i don't suggest buying these at all! don't waste the money!!"
1,I was hoping for some better remixes of this track. They are still pretty good. I like the bonus trax alot.
1,"I couldn't wait for the latest Hiaasen book to come out in paperback - they're usually clever and exciting. But this one is a bomb. I couldn't get past the second chapter. The story is filled with a hatred for all things conservative. I don't mind his opinions, but it hardly makes for a good read. Next time I'll scan the book first before I buy one of his. It's the kind of read that makes you wish you could return books if they're not up to snuff. Carl, go back to slanting the news - it's where liberals belong!"
1,"This is the book is pretty weak by Hiaasen's standards. I have read ""Double Whammy"", ""Tourist Season"", & ""Stormy Weather"", and this book stands below them. While Hiaasen excels in satire, and in both outlandish characters and stories, this book stretches that limit, and creates both characters and a story that are so absurd that it drags on and on. In his other books the central character at least has a semblance of normality to them that makes them easy to relate to, and keeps you interested in the story and how events unfold. In Lucky You, all of the characters lives are the extreme, and while events are amusing it goes overboard to the point that you lose interest. I have found myself putting this book down several times. The only thing that has me picking it back up, is that I have been a fan of Hiaasen's other books. So unless you're a diehard fan of Hiaasen's, I would suggest you skip this one, and move on to another book."
1,"This one is BY FAR the biggest waste of money of them all. This guy basically presents ONE idea in the whopping 145 pages, of which 75, yes SEVENTY FIVE are graphs that show, literally 2 bars or 2 lines. This is absolutely not an exaggeration. 75 of the 145 8.5"" by 11"" pages have ONE graph with 2 bars showing a comparison of, for example, how the S&P 500 performed after 2 consecutive down days over the next week vs 2 consecutive up days. That's it. Nothing else. 18 pages are tables of numbers that, if you've read one of them, you've read them all. This leaves 53 other pages, of which 11 are COMPLETELY BLANK!! Of the 42 remaining pages, maybe 10 of them have more than 2 paragraphs and fill more than 2/3rds of the page. This book is a complete sham. I highly recommend Amazon pull it. I will be calling Amazon to return this book immediately for a full refund."
1,"These headphones, while very cute and comfortable for my son, are a piece of junk. We purchased the Bear headphones and the ears fell off with the first use. They were still functional so I decided not to return them. Then, after only a couple of weeks of use the cord frayed near the volume control and they no longer work."
1,"As much as I would like to say this was a great horror movie, it, unfortunately, falls far short of the potential of the genuine feeling of fear created by the book it was based on. I have no objection to the actors, they all did a good job with the script they were given, and the adaption was even acceptable. My major problem with this movie wasin the use of GERMAN SHEPARDS, for god's sake, to represent the canine equivalent of man on the evolutionary scale. The whole point of the story was that a branch of canines had evolved as far as man had evolved from apes, and had kept themselves hidden from mankind for all these years, feeding on the weak and the sick among us, never allowing themselves to be discovered except in the legends of werewolves and devils of the night. Tn the book, it was presented as though it were both possible and likely. In the moviy, the wolfen were no more frightning than a pack of feral dogs hanging around a city dump."
1,I ordered a NEW copy of this movie and received an old copy. The box still had the original tape on it and these people just wrapped an old SCRATCHED disc up and tried to pass it off as new. I did get a refund but it still does not excuse the stunt that they pulled! WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THESE RIP-OFF artists again.
1,Book was said to be in good conditon but was only acceptable at best. Not packaged well and full of tears. Huge tear on the first page was not described nor all the outside wear. Too much writting on the sides and inside of book. Nowhere near good conditon.
1,I read the reviews and thought I would give this a try and ordered a bone one. I was so disappointed when I received it. The materail was thin cheap plastic that started to discolor/yellow after a few weeks even when not using it. The design was good but not the material and the super thin lining and it looked cheap on the outside. Not worth the price. I do not know about other colors but for sure would not recommend this bone.
1,"The earlier review is correct. No liner notes, complete deception. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,I liked the bock becoues it is the kind of book i would read the letter are short and the paragraph's the word's are easy to read i did not need a magnifyinglass to read it.The first fue chapters where the best it was the way that you could get into the book and understand It the beging was the easy to read to I hate to read but this book i cou;d read.jack was the maine character they said a lot about him he had a very good noise he could smeall anything and his dad and him looked like each other the dad is the janitor for the school he went to and the also went in to food to he was discribing the food he was smelling
1,"This silly comedy is nowhere near as funny or original as it thinks it is. The concept is old-hat and has been done better in films like PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO and WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT? This heavy-handed mess's script was recycled for the dreadful, even more pretentious LAST ACTION HERO, which came out the following year."
1,"This item is now selling at $29.95 for 4 in my area, and my experience has been to return them... The LED lense is not sealed. After 5 days there was moisture inside the lense. That will lead up to failure soon! Don't buy ANYWHERE!"
1,"Three years ago these were all over for under $30 for four pieces - and they WORKED WELL.Now the price has DOUBLED AND TRIPLED (PLUS!!!) and many of these are simply OLD, JUNK STOCK with their ***NON-REPLACEABLE BATTERIES*** DEAD OR DYING. Many are not sealed properly allowing water leakage and/or moisture to condense inside the totally sealed units. (If you're thinking of replacing the batteries - DON'T.)These are heavy solid, molded bases into which the end lights are inserted and glued from the inside, then the top solar panel is glued with heavy duty adhesive and set into the top effectively locking ALL ACCESS OUT FROM INSIDE. (IF YOU'RE THINKING ""DREMMEL TOOL"" - GOOOOOOOOOD LUCK!!!)There is a VERY, VERY GOOD REASON FOR ALL THESE ""1 STAR"" RATINGS.THESE ARE JUNK!!! AND AT ROYAL RIP PRICES TO BOOT. STEER CLEAR, YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!!!$107.00??? YEAH. RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT..."
1,"We got a PSOne to replace and older playstation that just wore out. I wished I had know about the power cord. It is not like any other Sony power cord and you can not, at this time, order a replacement for it as Sony parts don't know what the heck you are talking about! Our kitten chewed though the power cord and so I went to order one and could not get the right one sent to us. I am now looking for the original playstation as I am not buying another one of the PSOne."
1,"After reading the title you are probably thinking that I am going to tell you to buy PS2. No. I am here to tell you that this winter a product called Bleem will let you play PSOne games on Sega Dreamcast! Buy the CD, pop it in your Dreamcast and then pop in your PSOne game and play! It also inhansens the graphics (unlike PS2). So you can play 400 PSOne games and 200 Dreamcast games."
1,with the newer systems out why buy this. hardly games are being made for it anymore. i don't even play mine again. like a gamer said it should be discontinued like the dreamcast.
1,"This over priced hunk of junk is past its time. A lot of you Sony people think ""wow $100 what a great deal"" it was good a year ago, but it aint good now. First, the price. this thing $100, Dreamcast is $50. there both going out in about a year, but Dreamcast as internet connection, tons of great games (at a cheap price) and graphics to match PS2. as well as a bunch of the games released on PSONE. The playstation does have soe great games, but only a small few compared to the dreamcast library. if you find a PS1 for $50, don't turn it down, but for $100 its an absolute rip off! I have rented many games for it, and here are the ones i liked:Spyro seriesSiphon Filter seriesCool Boarders series. that only a few after litterally 500+ i've tried. sad, real sad. Please, if you want a system from sony just buy a used PS2, its the best Sony deal you can get."
1,I've paid 50 bucks for this thing and it's incomplete AND I WILL RETURNED and I want my money back
1,"I bought this module to fill it up with pictures of my family and to use the Vibe alarm in cases where sound would get me into trouble. Hey, I almost forget about the color update for my Prism. I would buy another if it had more memory like 16 or 32, but 2MB is like having pennies in your pockets. I would suggest getting the MemPlug, which gives you a lot of features for a reasonable price."
1,It worked great for exactly four uses! Then it stopped working for no apparent reason. I may try to get a replacement and try again.
1,"I had high hopes for this book, after flicking through a lot of the Java books in the bookstore, this one really appealed to me because of the large text and nice diagrams. And while the book was pleasently easy to understand (most of the time), it just doesn't flow very well. I found that around page 130-140 I was finding out the stuff I was wanting to know within the first few pages. They also throw in a chapter on HTML in the most inappropriate place. This book seems VERY rushed, and this is obvious from the large number of errors. I was stuck on my code for a number of hours, before I got help from someone on IRC... they were like ""uhh WHY does Switch always have a capital S?"" and I replied ""because this stupid book told me to *sigh*. Even the bonus pull-out ""cheat sheet"" that summarizes the whole book has at least one missing semi-colon. Trust me, get something a bit more... concise."
1,"Wow, this book was just downright horrible. After being extremely pleased with HTML for Dummies, I figured this would be of the some calibur. I couldn't have been any more wrong. The first 3 chapters are a nice introduction to the language but I don't think I ever made it through chapter 4; they throw everything at you within a matter of pages and expect you to understand it all. There are much better books out there."
1,"I like the ""Dummies"" series since it has helped me pass the GRE and learn HTML. However, I was incredibly frustrated with this book. I am so surprised that they published a book with so many errors. For example, the ""Hello World"" program had quite a few errors and for some reason appeared 3 times on the same page!The worst part was the flow and format. I had to start on chapter 8 and begin reading backwards to understand the concepts introduced, but even then things were not explained clearly.Its very rare when I give a bad review, but this one deserves 1 star just because of the numerous errors. To tell you the truth, I returned it the following day after buying it and haven't done Java since."
1,"At first I thought this brush was great, but then I noticed a bunch of the wires had fallen off and were on our plates. Apparently they just fell of the brush and stuck to the food. Too bad we were almost done with our meal before we noticed it. Stay away from this brush! The other reviewers are right...the wires DO fall out."
1,"I bought the Wayfarer glasses and they looked great when they first arrived. However, when I would fold the side of the glasses they right hinge felt a little funny. I ignored the problem and wore them out ONE TIME. The next day the glasses felt even funnier when I extended the sides and when I examined the hinge I saw that the plastic was beginning to crack. It only took a day or two before that the small crack in the hinge went all the way through the glasses and the right lens fell out completely because the frame couldn't hold it.So basically I bought these glasses for almost 10 dollars to wear them for 2 hours and then have them break on me in a week while they just sat on my desk. I honestly don't think it is possible to build a bigger rip-off.We'll see if I ever buy from Amazon again."

1,"The cover is hard plastic in the front and aluminum in the back but only held together by two rubber side inserts.

1,This got really grubby from my son taking his doll everywhere. I washed it in the washer and dryer and it did not survive. It shrunk and became ratty and frayed. You should be able to clean toys easily. This certainly cost enough to be a real baby outfit.

1,"I had a small problem with my unit and sent the seller 2 emails which were not returned to date. I had to return this item and thankfully Amazon took care of that for me. As far as using this it was in my pool for 2 days and took on a little water in the unit and the solar panels. Since the seller never got back to me I returned the cleaner and now Im back to using chemicals again. I sooo much wanted to try this thing out. I had saved up the money to buy it but when I needed help the seller was no where to be heard from. Sorry folks. My experience was not a good one. That doesnt mean this thing dont work, its just I didnt get a chance to use mine."
1,"Moved into a home with a large pool, found the Floatron semi underwater, pulled it out and threw it away. Our maintenence person still puts the exact amount of chemicals into the water and has not noticed any difference...I'd save my money."
1,"I used the chainsaw for half a day and it worked great. Enough power for branches and small trees. Then it quit. I opened it up and one of the wire going to the brushes was disconnected. Could not find an easy way to reconnect as it seems it was just stuck in a hole before. Tried my best to reattach, including soldering, but it quit again after a couple of hours, most likely same problem. It's not easy to take it apart and at the age of 72 I have cut a good 40 cords of beetle infested Ponderosas in my life (which kept me warm for 14 years), with a 36"" gas chainsaw that I took apart a number of time, but it took me about 3 hours to get to this connection. Also when you store the saw, you are supposed to drain the oil or it makes a mess in your garage. It's much easier to fill cleanly than to drain cleanly!"
1,every bag of crackers so far has been broken to bits. i'm about half way through my order as now.
1,"The contents are too basic, not of any use for a graduate student. I am very upset to have bought this very very elementary book. You would not need this book if you have access to internet to google ""bode"", ""rlocus"" MATLAB commands. There are lots of better Matlab examples in Dorf.- Ramin Shamshiri, Dec.2009."
1,I was not happy with this frame. I thought it looked cheap. It looks better on the internet than it does in reality! Not a great quality frame.
1,"Don't Bother - Avoid the InsanityI have had my heart broken by too many of these styles of ironman watch. The watch itself is Good, but the wristband does not last longer than a year. Then you are stuck with a watch that works but is un-wearable because there is no way to replace this type of band. NO Band Available.I know because I have 5 watches (so obviously I liked the watch mechanism) - At first I thought it was just a fluke that the wristbands broke. But I finally remembered - a definition of insanity is repeating the same action over and over and expecting different results.Now some of my watches are still ticking away in a drawer because there are No replacement wrist bands. It doesn't matter how great the watch is - if you can't wear it."
1,"The button labels on this watch are so small, I simply could not even read them. The picture of the watch on this site must be blown up several times because it led me to believe the labels were clear and visible. Well, they are not. I sent this back."
1,"I bought this watch in January. Last weekend I had it in the pool for less then 15 mins and the watch doesn't work any more, that's only 6 months. I bought it because I like to spent time in the pool and know what time it is. If you don't get it wet it's an ok watch."
1,"I've had Timex Ironman watches for years, but this band style is really prone to breakage.No issues with the watch performance, just the plastic band, which pops apart.It didn't happen immediately, so your mileage may vary.I got enough use out of it that I would not return it for being outright defective; it's just a poor and flimsy band style."
1,"This is my second watch in two years. On my first one, the band broke after about a year. I love the look of this watch and so I bought another one. My second broke last week after about 10 months. Apparently, it is not very water resistant while swimming laps! At first, the display fogged up but dried out after a day or so. When I went swimming again, the display fogged up again and the watch quit working all together. I've had many Timex watches over the years but, am pretty disappointed in this one."
1,This watch immediatly broke I give 1 star. What a waste of money! I gave it to my dog. It was not waterproof took it for a swim. borken bad horrble rip off
1,"I've had two ironman watches - I loved the design and ease of use, but both lasted less than a year. My advice - get it if you really like the look & the features, but don't expect it to last. Like many others' stories, the band on the first ironman broke around 10 months. My second one just got water condensation inside after 5 months. It was fine with swimming 2 or 3 times a month, then suddenly let in water and broke. Since I really like this watch, I may put up with it a 3rd time at $30-$35 on amazon. But if anyone finds a more durable, lightweight, multi-function, good looking watch - I'll be first in line to try it."
1,"I love this watch and is my second one, unfortunately both watches had the strap fail on them in less that two years. I sent Timex an email and they didn't reply. I love the functions on the watch and the simple look to it so am sad about this default. I am uncertain if I will buy Timex again."

1,"This hub has several rotten design features. First, it is extremely lightweight, and the weight of its own cord makes it tip on its back. Thus,you have to set something at least as heavy as a coffee mug on top of it. The USB ports in the back are in two pairs. Unfortunately, the ports in each pair are so close together that unless you have a super-flat USB plug, you cannot plug in two USB devices in a set, effectively making your four port hub a two port hub.It works okay, I really don't find a difference in speed from a cheaper port I had, and I don't care about the lights. I usually really like Belkin products, but this one is trying to fake us out with bells and whistles (or in this case, ports and lights)."
1,"I used this once then gave it away. For entertaining, the rings make a nice presentation. But you can easily cut chunks to look appealing. For normal use, know that a thick layer remains in the pineapple shell. Also, plastic handle feels flimsy."
1,"he gives plenty of stats and fine details but forgets that he's talking about people. it becomes very boring and lifeless, too much emphasis on details and not enough on the players behind the numbers. i recommend "" baseball in 41' "" by robert creamer, a fine book something that ""more than merkle..."" should've had more of."
1,"These are worthless! I bought these to go with my DYMO 450 Turbo to print postage for my business. No where in the product description does it say that these will not print a tracking number and that they do not work with any software (including their own DYMO software). After contacting DYMO support all they could do was confirm what I had spent three hours figuring out, they don't work with any software and they don't print a tracking number. Product description needs to be updated to include these important facts. I never would have bought them if I had known this. I wasted a lot of valuable time with these and had to cut and tape about 100 labels by hand while I waited for different labels to show up. Needless to say, an overall horrible and frustrating experience!"
1,"The phantom power does not work. I tried troubleshooting by the process of elimination. My AKG microphone works fine on my Mackie mixer. I sent it to Rolls during my 1 year warranty, and they just sent it back to me. I called them, and they told me to send it in again, but it's out of warranty now. Never buy this product if you're going to use a condenser microphone."
1,"well i got this i noticed that a battery was missing and it seems like just a piece of junk but i cant even tell because it doesn't even work right now and the batteries probably wont even last that long and i cant afford to keep buying them, another thing i was supposed to get a cord so i could plug it into my computer, i never got that either... so its a cheap piece of crap but im hoping it works the way i need it to."
1,"I ordered a Wilton ice cream scoop and received an off-brand made in China one that is not stainless steel. It's the same design as the Wilton one I used to own and loved. There is a Wilton copyright on the back of the card so I guess this company bought the design from Wilton. I'm still not happy. Too much trouble to send it back but I feel cheated. The Wilton one comes with the rubber grips in bright, cheerful colors and this one is black.I do not appreciate the brand switch. I expect better from Amazon."
1,I love the Ghosthunters and watch it faithfully. However these dvd's are terrible! So dark and such bad quality that I won't even watch them. I wish I knew how they can sell dvd's like this.
1,"The light keeps flickering shortly after having it installed by a licensed electrician. I then changed the bulb and that didn't help. It's very frustrating as the fan looks and works awesome but without the light, it doesn't serve my purpose. I will have another electrician look at it today and then make my decision. Returning it would be a real shame because I so love everything else about it."
1,"This unbelievably slow-paced game adds nothing new to the genre: Empire Earth 2 is just ""yet another"" RTS. The plethora of units only detracts from the game (who needs to memorize 300+ units and their special characteristics), and the division of the game into ""territories"" has been one of the worst ideas EVER.This game has been reviewed as ""Rise of Nations""-esque. Don't waste your money with this, as Rise of Nations is a better game than this will ever become. The plethora of resources (remember, Rise of Nations already has had complaints about the number of resources IT has, Empire Earth II just increases even more resources you have to run around) are not manageable as there IS no idle-citizen auto-control.All-in-all: Empire Earth II may contain some brilliant ideas, but the entirety of the game is pure, utter crap."
1,"I thought this game would be a great one and an improvement over the first EE. Well, not quiet, this EE2 has nothing to offer, the grqphics look like the ones in Age of Empires II (realeased in 1999 I believe). The game runs slow, i have a computer with the following specifications:*Windows XP*Dx 9.0c*Intel Pentium 4 3.06 GHz*2 GB of RAM*256 RAm video cardand yet the game runs slow.I love Empire Earth I because the graphics are good, and the game runs smoothly...This new released now is a major disappointment, and I dont understand why if the graphics are not good. The gaphics of this game look like a paint by an abstract painter.If you have played the first Empire Earth, you will see the difference between EE I and EE II, and you will go back to the first one.Save your money and play EE I ntil these guys come with a real improvement over EE I."
1,"Once I start reading a book I always finish it. This is one book I almost broke my word. Not realistic, vulgar complete waste time wring it and anyone reading it."
1,"Island Poorly written, too long for such a bad story line, not worth the read. Would not recommend though I did finish it disappointed"
1,"I had an idea from other reviews that I was about to read a book that was written by a perve, but I did not see that coming. This book is written in the format of a diary. It is 500 pages long, but about 250 pages is all about nipples, bare skin, hard ons and many other similar things. Which would be fine if this was meant to be an erotic read. It's not, from beginning to end it is a sick book. The end being almost the sickest. I read the entire book, so I can't give it one star. I did finish, but kind of wish I never would have started."
1,Too weird for me. Too much killing and mutilation. Not necessary for a good story. i'll know not to buy another one of Laymon's books.
1,"I was extremely excited about reading this book when I saw that both of my favorite authors had written so highly of it. What a disappointment. A few pages in, I suspected what the outcome would be. I found the book to be disgusting. I continued to read ONLY because I was hoping for a fairy tale ending. I definitely will not be wasting any more of my money on books by Richard Laymon...may he rest in peace."
1,"This book was fairly ridiculous. The plot was juvenile, but not completely predictable. It was an easy read, so I did finish it. The characters were not very likeable, and by the end I didn't care much what happened to them. There was a creepy twist at the end that I enjoyed."
1,"I have read a lot of Dean Koontz books and have enjoyed all of them, up to this point. I literally had to force my self to finish this book. Usually I finish his books (Watchers, Cold Fire, etc.) within a matter of a week TOPS. This one took me at least 3 months. It had a lot of depressing themes, more so than others. This was clearly his worst book yet."
1,"I have read several Koontz novels. It seems like we are beginning to see patterns from previous novels(i.e. dogs, TICKTOCK(actually another book), supernatural, warped personalities). I feel like I have read a similar story from previous stories written by Koontz. I think the dog piece is a stretch. The explanation of Bryan was another reach for the reader. I didn't feel the characters and their interaction with TICKTOCK was a good fit. I would recommend the book--but if you are a Koontz fan--you have seen this type of story before."
1,"If you really want to learn about the Law of Attraction, read the Bible. That's where all of this ""new thought"" approach comes from. If the Bible's language is too archaic for you, read any of Catherine Ponder's books. If you insist on this one, however, don't buy the CD; buy the book instead. Jerry Hicks' voice is grating and lacks emotion or animation. I couldn't even make it through the first CD so I gave it to a friend who agrees that his voice is beyond irritating."
1,Yes... VERY DISAPPOINTING!!! Can't think WHY it was ever banned ?!!! Don't bother! Wish I'd saved my money so don't waste yours!
1,"I agreed with 'a reader from Richmond.' This book stunk! I found Lute to be a totally obnoxious man with very few redeeming qualities. After enjoying books by Garlock such as The Listening Sky (my favorite), The Edge of Town, and With Hope, I was totally disappointed with the plot, the characters, and the overall plot of this book. If you've never read a Dorothy Garlock book, don't start with this one. Read one of the ones I mentioned and you'll be a Garlock fan. If you read this book first, you'll probably never read another one of her books and you'll miss out on some wonderful historical romances."
1,"I also read the book ""Who Goes Next"" that tells the true stories of daring escapes from prisons and prison camps throughout history, but this is not it. I ordered this book used and was disappointed to find it to be a 1960's detective/police novel. I would like to find the prison escape book."
1,"It's a condenced version of another one of Mr. Cheng's books and every example has you flipping back and forth between 5 different pages no less then 10 pages apart. The ""Preface"" says, ""Much of the material has been adapted and reduced from my larger book, Field and Wave Electromagnetics..."" Examples do not explain the work, I found these reviews while looking for a substitute book to help me through this class."
1,"I found watching 'The Ark' again quite sad. To me it illustrated how much the Doctor Who series under William Hartnell had declined, since its hey-deys in 1964 and 1965.The setting of the story was interesting enough, but somehow the episodes themselves just seemed to drag on. For me however, the worst aspect was the lack of interesting companions for the Doctor. Steven and Dodo were a poor substitute for Barbara and Ian. The actors themselves (Peter Purves and Jackie Lane) just seemed to lack the presence of their predecessors. Without an absorbing enemy to face, this Doctor Who story does not have enough to maintain the viewer's interest.For me the final negative was the use of the same sound effect within the Guardian hall on Refusis, as that used in the first ever Daleks episode. It just made the comparison more stark, that being one between a new and exciting series and one struggling to find its way."
1,"The very best episodes of the Star Trek television series (pl) are those which hold up viewing after viewing--a strong plot, charismatic characters, believable dialogue, and unique (usually) story. The same holds for the films, which is why this one is disappointing compared to most of its predecessors. The story lacks strength, the humor scenes are contrived, and (in my opinion), the characterizations are wrong. Most of the main characters of The Next Generation cast are lost in the movie, particularly Geordi, Troi, and Dr. Crusher. The effects are good, but I would have preferred less effects and more substance.However, this is a fairly ""good"" movie by box-office standards, and worth seeing at least once, although three or more times would be too many."
1,"I've grown up as a Trekkie and remember waching the old TV Series as a child with my father. I've always thought the magic of Star Trek was maintained very well over the years and through the various spin-offs, with only occassional minor let downs. I tried to be as open about Insurrection as possible, but found it a complete dissapointment. The story felt pieced together with a variety of unrelated issues appearing once and not being built upon at any other point in the film. There were far too many scenes that were not only predictable, but had an element of, dare I say, being on the hokey-side. The special effects were over-rated as I found many of the ships to actually look plastic, while the cinematography gave the film a MTV look. This film did not, in my opinion, carry the weight or impact of its predecessors. While it may be worth completing the collection for some die-hards, this one is waiting for the release of the earlier films."
1,"I love the Star Trek franchise just as much as I do Star Wars, but after viewing this movie it's obvious my priorities were not in order. The stroy is very weak and I have to agree with others that this is merely a TV episode. I don't know how/why Rick Berman let this story get green lighted. Save your money."
1,"Repeat after me---Star Trek is NOT a comedy!Star Trek is NOT a musical!Star Trek is about exploring strange new worlds and exciting adventures...which this is NOT!An revengeful alien wants to remove some peaceable people from off ""his planet"".Not even F. Murray Abraham can save this movie!"
1,I can't beleive I rented this movie. This was one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. If I were you don't waste your money on renting this movie it's slow.
1,"I have allways loved Star Trek ,but this one I am sure can't be a real Star Trek movie it must be a fake made by satan to torture us trekies . Or Maybe the ""Q"" had something to do with this movie,Because it's bad ,simply put. If you doubt my review than rent it or just watch it.. one of 20 times a day its on cable . However one redeaming quality of this movie is that Star Trek X has got a good shot at being a better movie than the previous film. One way to improve on the movie would be to have Mystery Science Thearter 3000 Have go at it."
1,"This movie was so bad compared to other Star Trek movies. This is why people look at Star Trek and call it boring. They try to mix romance with science fiction and it DON'T WORK! If you want a good Star Trek movie, go buy one of the first eight(except for the final frontier)."
1,"I purchased a S100 about 2 years ago and also an extra battery. After taking several thousand photos, these batteries are toast! Starting fully charged, it seems the ""low power"" icon now blinks on after taking only a few photos. Charging also seems way too fast, under a half hour (and it makes no difference even if I charge them overnight). I am looking for replacements, but Amazon doesn't seem to sell these any more. I suppose it's possible my charger is to blame, but these batteries don't last long under heavy use in my experience."
1,"While this is a beautiful book visually, it provides little concrete guidance on how to choose colors for your own home. The text isn't well-organized, and is presented in rambling narrative chapters rather than in a reference book format."
1,"Although the book is attractive, it only applies to people who like neutral schemes. Nothing wrong with that, but if you like COLOR, buy another book, NOT this one."
1,"The reviewers who love this book must be looking at a different book than the one I received. Or maybe those reviews were written by the author's mother! This book is so dull and the color choices are so limited that I don't see how the book's contents begin to match the title. Color palettes? It's all variations on beigy colors-everything the subdivision builder put in our new home and everything we are now trying to get rid of. Atmospheric interiors? If you like the atmosphere of a brown grocery bag, then you might like this book. Give me COLOR, please, and not variations on a safe, dated beige scheme that my mother would like."
1,"This is pretty bad stuff. Possibly the majority of the small number of people who are looking this bbok up heard about it in Phil Dick's Transmigration of Timothy Archer, a fine fictionalization of the life of Bishop James Pike. The book itself is a garbled mass of conjecture, symbolism at its worst (where everything is capable of equaling everything else) and poor linguistics. Definitely NOT Allegro's best work, but the premise is basically sound, Amanita muscaria cults were widespread and there's every reason to believe pre-civilized mankind was a much more avid mushroom worshipper than today's dilletantes. The only redeeming feature of the paperback edition is the reproduction of an early Christian fresco showing Adam and Eve being tempted with a large red, white-polka-dotted mushroom in a natural setting. That alone is worth the price of this wacky book. And of course all PKD fans know this is a must-have for their bookshelves."
1,"Allegro's viewpoint is unique for a simple reason-- it's garbage. The historicity of Jesus of Nazareth attests to this. It doesn't matter how many obscure references and etymological transforms one can pull, early Christians eating Amanitas or not, the person of Jesus was. Even if the Biblical take on Jesus is complete myth, that doesn't entail it's a myth spring from mushrooms. Yeah, hallucinogens are awe-inspiring, but they aren't the wellspring of all human thought. Frankly, the theory of relativity is a whole lot more ""out-there"" than the story of Jesus, and that was born in a perfectly psychedelic-free mind. In the end, if a ""history"" book (specifically this ""history"" book), claims to be both revolutionary and academic, then it is probably lying about one or the other, or possibly even both."
1,"I formerly owned a Nomad II, which broke after about a year. I then purchased a Nomad II MG, which I had to return because the charging cradle didn't function. I purchased another one, and that one stopped working after about thirty days. I would steer clear of this frail product.(P.S. Why would anyone with an IQ higher than a chimp buy three of these things? I couldn't find another one with expandable memory and an FM tuner)."
1,"Great songs and performances all around. Too bad the sound is poor. My copy also cuts out completely in two spots - just blank spots in the middle of songs. Instead of this cheapo disc, buy the ""At Joe Gibbs"" set instead, it includes everything here and sounds great."
1,"can't believe this case is too small, after reading reviews that case is too big for other cameras. I think it is irresponsible that these cases are being sold for cameras they don't fit. WASTE of MONEY..."
1,"This book makes me think of something that could be made in to a very bad ""TEEN"" movie. It has a plot, that goes nowhere, and was really annoying. It is packed full of bad jokes, corney puns, and other bad stuff."
1,"unfortunately the DVD was for America and since I am in Australia, it would not play here. Soo disappointed !"
1,"I ordered this book paying extra for overnight shipping, because my next class was 4 days away, and a week later, the book is still not here, along with the estimated shipping date being another week away.I've called Amazon and they said it was in the hands of UPS now. I call UPS and they state it's a backlog from the holidays.If I pay for overnight shipping, which is quite expensive, I expect it to be here in at least 3 days. The book was ordered before the holidays, and honestly, I wouldn't mind if my book were to be backlogged one or two days, but it's taking two weeks now and I'm falling behind in class.I should have paid the $250 at my local bookstore and gotten it the day before class. I guess I won't order from Amazon again."
1,"Only reason I ask that is because the first review used the phrase ""stick-in-the-mud..."" which hasn't been used since before WW2...Ramone! Hogwash is what Jim does in the tub after he abuses the gargoyle of a fat girl."
1,"This book is the biggest waste of money that I have been forced to suffer through. The examples in each chapter are poorly written and are so much simpler than the actual ""test questions"" at the end of each chapter so as to be useless. Additionally, the selected answers in the back of the book seem to be wrong as often as they are right. You couldn't pay me enough to recommend this book to anyone."
1,"At least in Kindle format, this book is useless!! I went through about the first quarter of the book, and still never got to the meat & potatoes. It was just the author repeating over & over that the program works, and never getting to what the ""program"" IS!! Truthfully, made me want to smoke MORE to relieve the boredom!! Since it WAS a Kindle, at least no trees were killed to bring me this garbage!"
1,"I am glad this seems to have helped many people quit smoking.I read it about a week after I stopped smoking.The book has an evangelistic/conspiracy theory tone common in self-help books which put me off. The author also spends a lot of time talking about himself.I did not find that he had any new ideas. The main theme seemed to be, ""You think you enjoy smoking, but you don't. You think you do because it is an addition"" or ""Other people fooled you into thinking you enjoy smoking""Neither were new ideas, or helpful to me. Not really a method."
1,"I got this book after reading so many great reviews of how it helped people quit. Well, I have no idea how they even got through this waste of paper. At first I thought it was just me, not paying attention to where I left off, but then I saw that some pages were exactly the same, word for word. How many times can you tell someone smoking is disgusting and you don't need willpower to quit? Apparently many. The repetition in this book made me so angry at the poor quality, I wanted to smoke more. This guy is a joke- He quit smoking through hypnosis and now he thinks he knows all the secrets? Um, no. He is just trying to make money (and apparently its working) off people willing to try any way to quit.I almost feel guilty trying to re-sell this book and get some of my money back..."
1,"Guy quit with smoking by a hypnotherapist.Writes same thing over and over. Nicotine is bad. Got it. But wait til the end of the book before you quit smoking. Yep. Understood, digested, however after 21 years of smoking still smoking."
1,"I've just reached the chapter where he tells me I have to read the book again. I believe everything he says (except why I started) but the constant attacks have actually got me smoking MORE and have me terrified of trying to quit! He could have reduced the book to a few words. You are a drug addict. Stop feeding your addiction. Plus a few more words on how filthy, unhealthy, expensive and pathetic smoking is. But I already know all that."
1,There are better books than this on operating systems. This book is very wordy...great for those nights when you cannot fall asleep.
1,This book is wordy and confusing. The questions at the end of each chapter could only be answered if you have experience with operaing systems and computers. This is not a beginners book. It is probably a fine graduate level book or a an adv. operating systems book in undergraduate. BUT NOT A FIRST COURSE IN OPERATING SYSTEMS.
1,"This bag has lots of pockets for batteries, cords, and memory cards, and plenty of room for my Olympus C-4000 camera. Unfortunately, within 3 months of purchasing it, the attached handle began to tear, and I can only use the included longer strap."
1,I bought and returned this bag. It is huge. I could have fit three digital cameras in there. The reason I bought the digital camera (olympus 3020) is that it is small and compact. This bag is almost as big as my camera bag for my SLR. My bag was also missing the divider so the camera would just flop around in the bag.
1,"I love the concept of this book, but the numbers at times contradict other sources (like the IF rating system on the Self Nutrition Data online). I would have more confidence in the data if I could verify it online, but I often end up with more questions than answers. This is a huge problem when researching nutritional information: if you're looking up protein content of a certain food, for example, you can find different answers from different--even trusted--websites. While I have a lot of respect for the author, I'm not sure who to believe at this point. Maybe for the next edition, a fact-checker can go through the numbers and verify them."
1,"This book is not credible.The information is faulty. I did a lot of research about inflammatory and anti inflammatory foods on the internet. Meats of all types except fish and some other sea foods are inflammatory and caused me lots of arthritis pain in my hands. I guess this book that sounded like such a credible source was very faulty in their research and formula for anti imflammatory foods. The book listed meats as anti imflammatory. This is so very wrong and inaccurate information. I wasted my money and has trashed the worthless book. It makes more sense and has thought me a lesson, to research topics of interest on the web and not waste my cash on misleading books. I'm very upset with my purchase. This book has caused me to trust misleading information and more so, much arthritis pain. Dead sorry in beautiful Hawaii!!!"
1,A lot of opinion dressed but as fact. Spotty writing and even spottier grasp of the subject. The author seems more interested in pounding his idiosyncratic viewpoint into the reader's head than in educationg them.
1,"My shoe size for leather shoes is 9US. I ordered the 9.5 M US hoping that with the .5 allowance, the shoes will fit fine. Guess what? I should have ordered a 10.5. The shoes are too small (like an 8). I managed to put my feet inside but I could no longer walk. But even with the right sizing,I will not recommend the shoes as they are as hard as wood, almost as hard. Perhaps if you're looking for a weapon, buy them and they will do just fine."
1,"Caution...The manual states that pureed fruits and veggies only has a 3 cup capacity!!!! Don't assume that it can hold the 14 cups... it can hold the 14 cups of sliced or shredded cheese or veggies, but not pureed food. Totally misleading/false advertising. I needed it to hold at least 8 cups of pureed food for what I'd be using it for. I'm returning mine... wish it was available w/ prime when I got mine. Now I am battling with a independent seller to return it! AHHHH....Read the manual for yourself:http://www.cuisinart.com/products/food_processors/dfp-14bcn.html"
1,"I should have read the reviews before I wasted my time and money. This is really junk. It doesn't cut ""Anything"" least of all a tomato. Balance is off, and hollow feeling in the handle. I don't know what the slats on the side are for, they do nothing to help cut through anything. Don't wast your money."
1,"I have 10"" laptop so I'd looked for mini mouse for a big while. I used ultra mini mouse from Targus before. It was a bit too small to work comfortably and it was too noisy in the class. Till I found this lovely mouse. About the right size for mini laptop, perfect size for hand. It comes with USB charger cable which I didn't expect. Everything was so cool until it was fully charged. Nightmare! I've got no control over the mouse. The USB receiver keeps turning off. I have to shake a mouse once in a while to wake it up. Moreover, if your laptop is very slim, the USB receiver might be too wide for your vertical USB slot. Although it has extra extension cable, what is the point of having extra cable for wireless mouse? However, I'm very impressed with Iogear design. I'll give it a try. I'll buy the mini optical one and I'll let you know how it works."
1,I could not program this unit so it was useless to me. i returned it and got one that was easy to program and easy to use. I am sure that this product is a very good scanner but it did not meet my needs.
1,"A few of the diary entries were interesting to read (I especially liked the story of the china doll), but the quilt blocks were a major disappointment. Each block was named after an entry in the corresponding diary entry rather than by its commonly used name. No patterns given for the blocks, only a line diagram and a small picture of an actual fabric block. Civil War Women by Barbara Brackman is a much better choice for historical background, diary entries and actual patterns."
1,"I'm coming from a musician's perspective, so fair warning.With that in mind: This thing sounds absolutely awful. Obviously fake instruments, outdated synths, simplisitic arrangements. Still, if you want karaoke versions of the songs from the show, it gets the job done. We actually ended up finding the songs on other discs because I couldn't stand the way they sounded on this disc."
1,"One of the most frustrating pieces of equipment I have ever bought. The legs need to be fully extended for them to securely lock into place, if not, a simple adjust to the camera causes the leg(s)to collapse. Get set for that perfect picture, press zoom, there goes the leg. Better off buying a tripod with individually locking leg sections."
1,"twice as heavy as other lightweight portables regarding total backpack weight.. and it BROKE after about 6 months No abuse, but one of the legs pulled out of the socket, and the socket broke apparently from pulling out aforesaid leg. Gluing it back in is not working real well. I am going to buy something else very soon. nice compact size when folded, though. ultimately, thumbs down."
1,"No subtitle options, mostly about sex and temptations, not a great plot. Sound track not clear enough, needs subtitles. twisted."
1,"It says:This Collectors Edition also includes three classic Robert Anton Wilson lectures: The Acceleration of Knowledge, The New Inquisition, and Religion for the Hell of It.That's completely untrue. The package only contains an interview with Mr. Wilson."
1,"Like 2 other posts, the pan popped out on the second knead cycle right out of the box. My excitement of my first homemade loaf was almost completely lost after 4 attempts to keep the pan in place. I went in search of troubleshooting recommendations and they all including jerry-riging the unit somehow. I don't think something right out of the box should need wires and pliers to keep the pan seated! Luckily I was able to salvage the dough. I let it rest for 2 hours, kneaded it myself and baked it in the oven. For what its worth it tasted good. I'll be using that christmas gift money towards a completely different brand."
1,"Read carefully, this is NOT sugar free, it kind of aggravated me because of the title for the order. The product is delicious, I like it but thought it was LOW (NOT) Sugar and LOW (NOT NOT NOT) calorie. Please change the title!"
1,"Don't get me wrong. I love BAywatch, but I simply can't watch the series on dvd. I feel like I just threw money away, like being cheated on. The theme song has been altered, as have the end credits. And as if that wasn't enough, many of the music clips during the episodes, have other songs. It simply doesn't work, as I've come to love the music montages. I want the true show on dvd, with the original music and montages. If shipping to the US weren't so expensive, I'd ship the three season I have straight back to Fremantle. This is not what I paid for. I guess I'll have to buy the German version."
1,Well according to what I am reading we are missing an episode from the DVD (Nightmare Bay) and all the music is replaced...So why bother? Is this really worth $20??? I can get over the music part but to cut off an entire episode...sign me up to NOT buy this. This is more of a -10 star set after all this.
1,Cannot get it to go on without terrible distortion and bubbles. Sorry I bought it and wasted my money.
1,"Google Online Help section regurgitated. A very simple book, not even useful for the inexperienced. Google Help (http://www.google.com/help/index.html) is better."
1,"I think it's bad enough that the label says 100% Gel when it's not, but even the description gave no indication of the added ingredients. As soon as the bottle came and I saw its clear contents, I knew it was not what I was looking for as pure aloe is not clear. Many people seem to like this product, but it needs to be labeled properly. Shame on me for not reading the reviews, I guess."
1,"Although not technically a lie, putting 100% in the label is grossly misleading considering all the additives in this product. Personally, I consider it criminally misleading. Although I have bought a lot of this product in the past when it was less adulterated, I'll never buy any Fruit of the Earth Product again.I recommend ""Aloe Vera Gelly"" produced by ""Lily of the Desert"".Thanks to the reviewers below who described the chemicals."
1,"It's great that you won't burn yourself when you pick up a heavy, hot pan. But suddenly, unable to keep a natural grip, you will drop the pot on your foot and break a bone or 20 (the human foot has many bones).My son, who is otherwise a great person, bought me this mitt. I will return it because it is so hard to use. It forces my thumb into an unnatural position which is not conducive to grasping, let alone lifting. I have it in mind to give him a stern talking-to."
1,"JUST WAY TOO BIG! USELESS FOR MOST WOMEN!MOST HOUSEHOLD COOKS ARE WOMEN!DUH!EVERY ONE SHOULD BE MARKED ""XXL"" for EXTRA EXTRA LARGE!"
1,"Compared to the original sized Orka mitt, this 11"" size fits my finger length better. However, it is still cumbersome to use because Orka did not make the thumb of the mitt shorter. A similar product that feels better to me is the oven mitt made by Silicone Zone. The Silicone Zone oven mitt is made with a more pliable material and has a right and left hand mitt. I like the Silicone Zone oven mitts much better. Now, if only amazon.com would start selling it, that'd be great."
1,The size was laughable to say the least. The price for an amount of .05 oz for $8.99 reduced price. Laughable; Direction to apply were hard to view.Finally the lube still didn't solve the belt slipping problem that the tread mill company suggested.
1,"I am sorry to say that I am very disappointed in the cost and the shipping technique. I received a very small flat plastic tube with very little oil in it, one was broke due to the way it was packed. Nothing like the picture and for the price of the item I was shocked!! Paying $5.00+ for shipping and handling on an item that small and got broken in the process very disappointed indeed!! Be warned this is a very small packet of lube and will only maybe lube your treadmill once. I do know what a half ounce is and most of mine leaked out!!"
1,"Other reviewers were generous. I respect that.I'm not much of a hater, but this product made me mad. I can't imagine the inventors actually film. The casters switch directions in the middle of a motion in any direction. I practiced over and over, and it kept doing the same thing.I didn't end up using it for quite a while after I bought it, for various reasons. After one use, realizing it was useless to me, I smashed it for some anger release. I will say it worked quite effectively for that purpose."
1,"Save yourself -DO NOT BUY THIS CD IF YOU LIKE GOOD MUSIC!! I only bought this CD because I read some guy's review that compared him to SRV in regard to his playing and singing style. The guy that wrote that is an idiot. This CD is so bad that i cringe when I see the cover. Nuno's tired riffs and half-hearted playing make me want to vomit. His lyrics are terrible. His singing is decent at best; unfortunately he is singing his own material.The one positive thing that I have to say about this CD is that the picture on the cover reminds me of David Caruso from CSI: Miami. That, and it's not my music. Terrible!"
1,"I had great hopes for this book, written by one of the consultants who helped make Cindy Jackson (of _Living Doll_ fame, known for having transformed herself into a beauty by an effort of will) what she is today. However, the information contained in this book was very, very basic stuff that repeats itself every few months in fashion magazines: make sure your nails are in good repair before an interview, wear clothes that fit, etc. There really isn't much in this book about what it means to create, convey, and maintain a personal brand identity.Weirdest tip: if you have clammy hands, carry a can of spray deodorant around and dose yourself before you have to shake hands."
1,"This thing can't pull a piece of paper strait through no matter what. One side always pulls faster than the other, so you eventually have the paper 1) being printed at an angle and 2) jamming unless you're there to try to guide it through.Secondly, the cartridges are outrageously expensive. I still use this machine because I only get/send a fax every now and then, but if I were a regular faxer, I'd trash this Brother in a second. The company should have recalled all of this model."
1,I love these Method hand soaps but this does not smell anything like Pink Grapefruit at all....prefer the Green Tea.
1,"I would recommend this book to readers who are intersted in books that have to deal with outside, nature,with kids who experince being on their own with no parents. I think that this is more of a teenager's book because it has to deal with two teenagers who have problems that they are going through and they learn how life is like being alone in the wilderness with no one to help them."
1,This book was part of our survival unit in seventh grade. I was bored and anoyed the entire time. There was a lot of sitting in the crashed car and siting fallowed by more sitting. I hope today they give the kids something good like when all hell breaks loose by Cody lundine or something that may actually help in a survival situation.
1,"I bought this lamp because my halogen lamp put out so much heat, it was nearly unusable. I wanted something that I could put a CF bulb into to save on heat production (and energy usage). The price was a big selling point, and it looked good enough in the pictures.This lamp isn't very well made. The connection between the base and the arm is very loose (wobbles side-to-side, back and forth, and rotates with barely any force at all. Also, the switch (built into the back of the head) is very flimsy and doesn't fit on the head straight.I'm keeping it, but only because I need a lamp that I can use and don't want to spend over $100 on one--but I'm not happy."
1,"The editors made a good try to translate the poems, but the result makes me laugh!They can translate the meanings but they can't keep the feelings, formats, sounds, favors, and metaphors.This book can fool people who can't read Chinese. Chinese is my first language, this book can't fool me!If you are a professor or teacher, please stop showing off your ""good taste"" by forcing your student to read this piece of stupid translation. You need to learn Chinese to read real Chinese poem."
1,"This book is written for an ancient version of minitab, version 10. Heavy emphasis on command line codes. Statistical explantions are highly technical. Do not waste your money. The free tutorial that comes with Minitab has significantly more value."
1,"I picked this up because I figured - heck a controller and you get a game for about 10 bucks more. Well, maybe I should have thought twice and just purchased the controll and nunchuck combo because the game held my 8 year olds attention for about 1 day total. He did play it through all of the levels to the tanks, which he did really like. But with games like Lego Star Wars for only $20 I would have been much better off to get the combo and another game and skip the wii play."
1,"After playing sports resort where the games are a lot more fun and graphics more presentable, wii play just isn't up to par. I bought this because I needed another remote and since a remote costs $36 (nintendo) or $30 (nyko), I guess to pay a little more for a remote + game may be a better deal. Like many other reviewers have said, it's like a buying a remote for $30 and $10 for the game.However, not all the games are bad. I like the pool game. The shooting game is simple but passable. The cow game is also fun but pretty much for young kids. The tank game is ok. The rest is just plain silly.So if you need another remote, go ahead and get this. Otherwise pass on the games. Better off getting sports resort."
1,"Like most of these other reviews I'll emphasize that this is basically a gimmick to get you to buy some pretty lame games because they are packaged with the remote.Chances are like most people, myself included, you'll play the games once or twice, figure out they are pretty lame and wish you had just bought the remote by itself instead."
1,"If you really need a wii remote and can't find one then this is the game to buy. Overall this game is horrendous and shouldn't even have been released. I was hoping this would be similiar to Wii Sports but it makes Wii Sports look like the greatest game ever made. Save your $50 and wait for a $40 wiimote, people will be giving away this game free soon."
1,"Even with the free remote, this game is not worth the money. They really failed on this one. The ping pong (which I was looking forward to) isn't even a game, it's just volleying back and forth until you miss. The one or two ping pong shots you have to make on Smooth Moves is more challenging and fun. The fishing game, and horse game (whatever it is) are extremely lame. The shooting game could be fun, but it only has a certain number of levels, and then you're done.....boring. There are a couple of other games that are alright, but really nothing to jump up and down about. If you're interested in a game of pool or laser hockey, than buy it, but it's certainly not worth the pricetag!!!!"
1,"Wii play is only worth your money if you buy it with the Wiimote. The game itself keeps you busy for about 5 minutes. There is no challenge, and Wii Sports is your best choice for a game to play with others. If you don't need a wiimote, dont waste your money."
1,"I bought this game because it came with a free controller. I played each of the mini games once. They are beyond bad. My kids played once and never put the game into the Wii again. Good for controller, but I could have saved a few buck by just buying an extra controller by itself, because the game is worthless."
1,"these games are terrible total waste of money, just by the remote by itself and save the extra $10 to put toward a real game.I also don't get the concept of having to play one crappy game to UNLOCK the next crappy game. I heard other games on the WII do that as well. That is just stupid if I don't want to play a game I should have to to get to a different game (rant over.)"
1,i bought this game in order to get the extra wii controller. The game is lame and boring. And you can simply buy a controller at local Walmart at a much lower price.
1,"the game is worthless. you need a second controller, but just buy it alone. even at $8 the game is a waste."
1,"I was disappointed with the limited number of games you can play and the complexity of the billiards game. I did not think the game was worth the price. It would be a great game for $10 with remote, but not for what I paid on here."
1,"The good news is you get a Wii remote and a game for only $10 more than a Wii remote by itself. The bad news, $10 is about all the game is worth. You get a bunch of tacky little games on the game disc. Unfortunately, it forces you to play each one in sequence to advance to the next level and unlock the next game. Most of the lower level games are very childish (and boring) but you have to finish playing them to access the good ones. I'm tempted to throw out this game and use the storage case for the sports game that came with the Wii system."
1,"I got this because i wanted another remote but also a game besides Wii sports, its nice getting the controller but the game is horrible, its in really bad quality and just looks like a game that should have been free. I should have just bought the controller but we all live and learn, don't buy this product"
1,Wii Play games are really boring but i think it could be fun when you play it with your family or when you throw a party.Basically i got this for the extra remote.
1,This pack of games would not have been impressive in 1980. The cow racing is amusing for about 5 minutes and the rest are terrible. Don't get talked into this unless you want to use the game disc as a mini-frisbee; Just buy the wiimote by itself and buy a pizza with the extra $10 (with some extra toppings.)
1,"got this game because it was on sale and it came with a wii remote, at the time i did not realize that the wii remote was NOT motion plus, with was a huge problem since most of my games require it. However the remote works great with my other non motion plus games and my 2 yr old can use it while i use the motion plus. the wii play game however is a total waste of money! its a series of short games as u 'beat' one game another one opens up. i got through most of them in under 30 mins, i, currently stuck at the poll one it takes too much effort for such a crappy game. im happy with the wii remote but the game sucks!"
1,I thought it was going to be more fun but it was not. Great deal though.. A game and a remote!
1,"I have been a sience finction fan for 40 years. Had not seen this movie. But, unless you are interested in Sci-Fi nostalgia, this movie is a DOG! Not worth the money."
1,"If you're a John Carpenter fan (Starman, Alien, etc.), you might be interested in seeing his early work, but if not, skip this DOG of a film. The one laugh I did get from the film was from the use of the muffin baking pan as part of the spacesuit design. It was so tacky that it was funny."
1,"Very disappointing--I fell asleep 2/3 of the way through the movie. Unless you like quirky student films, don't waste your money."
1,"I didn't realize until after I read it that this movie was made with such a low budget, and by beginners, or else I might have liked it a little. Not knowing that, I compared it to movies like Soylent Green, Logan's Run, etc., and was almost offended by the shabbiness of the sets, acting, and fairly pointless story. I'm sure some people would be impressed with the humor(?), or the story(?), but I mostly thought it was worthwhile to watch it as an artifact in the history of sci-fi film. In this way, it's worthwhile, I think."
1,My mfc printer was not working ok since about a couple of months. Today when I call up Brother help line they say that the print head is gone and may have to replace it ($150) value! . I have not taken more than 300 prints in these 16 months . Not worth buying this machine.
1,"This all-in-one printer/scan/fax etc.. was great in the beginning. However, just after the 90 day warranty expired, the print quality began to fall, especially with the black ink. The customer service people only tell you what you can read in the manual and their service center for D/FW is over 20 miles away. The print head has failed, costing 150.00 plus labor. So...here I am searching for a new machine. Buyer Beware!"
1,"I've used the Nylabones for my dogs (Pugs) for a while now. I've always thought they were safe and that the little pieces that to break off were harmless to a dog. This was my impression from reading about them.I was almost dead wrong. I stress the 'almost' as $2,300 in vet bills later, my dog is recovering. She had 3 dime- to quarter-size chunks permanently lodged in her stomach that resulted in a blockage. A blockage that resulted in 4 days of vomiting bile and loosing 10% of her body weight.Be warned and stay away from this product."
1,Its very rare to find a book about a subject you love that is this bad. Mr. Langworth the author of this book should be publicly flogged. To begin with the recommendations in this book are horribly dated. The author rated Buick Boattails a better investment that 60 era GS's. Furthermore the book didn't even mention the GSX. Mr. Langworth also stated that a 1972 Buick 455 produced 225 horses. If you love Buicks do not even think about this book. I can only apologize to mother nature that trees actually had to die to keep this dribble in print
1,"I was drawn to this book because I wanted to read a good story about mammoths. After reading this book, I am still waiting to read a GOOD story about mammoths.This was book should be declared an ""unimaginable atrocity"" by the UN for its disgusting and pointless portrayal of animal abuse. Where is the ASPCA? Any plot was completely drowned out by the awful violence. I can't recommend this book to anyone!"
1,I ordered these because it seemed like a good buy. I received them fine but I was not happy. They are very small seeds. They are over roasted to the point of being so dry that there is only a crunchy dry tastless seed inside.I had several other people try them and they thought the same thing. I am stuck with all of them because they are not returnable. So if you want to try them do not order very many at first.
1,"I was disappointed in this product. I much prefer the taste of Near East couscous, however it wasn't offered on amazon when I placed my order."
1,The towels are okay but the logos are a VERY flimsy decal that will peel or wear off with even light use. These towels are for decorative use only.
1,"although, i've enjoyed this album, i still can't believe blues man bela fleck has let his depression get the best of him by recording a ""goth"" album. he really must feel down, as his vocals don't even sound like the bela fleck that i know and love. the production work is good, but using a cello? is the guy pulling a david bowie/garth brookes thing? bela don't need to play that game. give me better times!"
1,"It actually made my stomach worse. Might work for some people but it wasn't for me. Unfortunately, now I have about 8 boxes that I will not use."
1,Disappointed in what is said to be season 2 is really season 3 and is missing the beginning of the first 3 episodes.
1,this jack is a menace to its user and should be removed from service it does not hold a vehicles weight and it flexes too much causing the vehicle to fall very unsafe product
1,"First, the menuing and navigation system is the stupidest and most counterproductive I have seen on a DVD. Normally if I don't like the menus I just use chapter / track search, but that is disabled when playing this DVD.I don't understand why they bothered to include a DTS track unless it was so they could put a ""DTS"" sticker on the label and fool everyone into thinking this is a well-mastered DVD. It is not. Also the ""Audio"" track selection is disabled, so you have to search around the menus to eventually find ""vector control"" to set the audio.Video quality is very bad. Lighting was apparently a problem, camera lenses were dirty and there was excessive glare."
1,"If you play Warhammer 40k you'll almost certainly need this book since Marines are the flagship army of that game. Unfortunately this book is very hard to use.GW chose to put the rules and background for units and some weapons in one section, the rules for some weapons and equipment in another and then the point cost and statistics in a third.So to learn what your Marine Scouts do you have to flip among three different sections.The book of course does not have an index.The other aspects are also disappointing. Most of the art is reused from other rulebooks, some of it is 15 years old. The models are standard models with decent paint jobs but nothing extraordinary. There are none of the great dioramas or conversions from older 40k rule books.It's a shame GW didn't make this book easier to use or more interesting to read."
1,"The only suspense in this book is what favors it took to secure the glowing grace notes. If the plot or narrative generate suspense, it is only momentary. The mystery here is not about Victorian art thefts, but about what makes an audience. Presumably someone enjoyed this thoroughly trite, contrived, and transparent novel. Presumably some editor forsaw that this audience existed. And in a world teeming with aspiring authors, that is quite an achievement. Mysterious."
1,"This was engaging enough, and the writing was competent, but I got extremely tired of reading about a heroine who was such a bad judge of character! Her self-centeredness combined with an unerring instinct to make the wrong choice each time she was presented with one made her a very unlikable character."
1,"Boring. I bought it because I'd heard an interview with the author on the radio and was intrigued. Ended up skimming the last quarter, just to say I'd finished it."
1,"I was so excited to get this lunch bag. When it arrived, it was ripped. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning it, etc. Not worth it. So disappointed."
1,"This is not bad for an amateur type video. I had expected a more professional production to be on sale at Amazon, well I guess I learnt something too. One cannot take away from the fact that the hunting trip recorded is a remarkeable achievement and I am envious particularly since I live in the southern hemisphere and a long way from Alaska. A great story but the production quality is not up to the same standard."
1,"This book was somewhat unfocused and weak especially in discussion of Japanese/European interactions. There were three general areas covered. The actual 1940's submarine missions described and recovery efforts in the 1990's were interesting and seemed well thought out. The author fleshed out the book with suppositions, attention to somewhat irrelevant details and general information about Japanese interests (embassies, spies, etc.) in Europe as WWII was winding down. The writing in this last area lowered my interest in the book to where it was hard to finish."
1,"I tried ordering the original version of this cd, The Sauce, three different times...each time I received EXTRA Sauce, which is the version with Mickey Raphael's over-the-top harmonica tracks laid in all over every song. Mickey may be a good player, but Eddie's original Sauce release stands tall (and much better) all on its own, sans the cheesy harmonica. The pic of the cd cover says The Sauce, but beware that you'll probably receive Extra Sauce if you order this product. The good news is that Amazon makes returns easy!"
1,"My expectations were set by the price, and I expected more insights and/or a book I could enjoy reading and displaying, since we adopted our son from Guatemala. The book is written extremely simplistically, to the point that it can be painful to read for anyone with a reading level over fifth grade or so. The photographs are okay, but there is nothing particularly unusual or enlightening about them, and one could find basically the same kind of thing in travel brochures. Overall, it's just way too expensive for what it is."
1,"This book though interesting in some ways, it was very poorly written. There were numerous errors in typing and factual dates were inaccurate. The author used quotes from other books on the royal family, so a lot of the information was second hand and already covered in other books on the subject. As a first book on the prince in paperback it is ok, but I am sure there will be other books to follow that will be much better quality."
1,I wonder if the manufacturer has changed. Neither the original nor the replacement played in my computer and I had freezing in my dvd player. A bad batch?
1,"I got this DVD yesterday, and watched it immediatly. Disk wasn't snaped on steady in a box, so it was shifting around during the transportation and got scratched. Also none of my two DVD players and two computers could play performance part of a program. But workout part was nice and pleasant to dance.Tanna Valentine are so good instructor and exellent dancer. If you will get a nondefective copy of this disk you will love it totally."
1,The game is boring! No written instructions came with it. Why does it shift and exclude pairs or three of a kind in the totals?
1,"I always think the bad reviews I read won't happen to me. Don't make that mistake on this one. I used this only a handful of times on broccoli soup - nice and tender cooked with plenty of fluid - and the plastic gear was ""cooked."" Stripped nicely round. Impossible to replace. Really made me mad. Cuisinart is usually a good name, but definitely don't buy the name for this."
1,After only a couple of months of use the plastic melted where the two pieces attached. Called Cuisinart and I have to pay shipping both ways to have it replaced. A real disappointment for having a product such a short time. I had my previous Cuisinart Imersion Blender for more than 15 years without a problem.
1,My Smart Stick worked beautifully until I was using it to make pea soup and a small piece of ham bone came in contact with the blade. The result? A broken unit that cannot be repaired.
1,"I actually bought this from Sam's Club. The chopper NEVER worked and after one use, the blender didn't work. The top portion sounds like it's working but it doesn't turn the chopper or blender. I tried WD-40 on the blender attachment but it still didn't work. I agree with another reviewer who said it's difficult to separate the top from the attachments. My advice: buy a separate stick blender and chopper. I had a cheapy Sunbeam stick blender for years which worked very well. And I now have a Black & Decker mini-chopper which works great."
1,"This movie follows hot on the heels of the success of ""Blades of Glory"" - but cannot be compared in a favourable way at all . The trailer for this movie was what prompted me to buy it and how much i enjoyed ""Blades of Glory"" - I was very disappointed , it just never took off and i certainly tried hard to find anything funny in 90 minutes .Personally it might have succeeded more with a different cast & better script ."
1,This knife is light and has an edge. I was quite excited about it the first day. It cut tomatoes and onions cleanly with no bruising. But when I went to slice a day old baguette for french toast on the following morning the edge chipped away in many little shards. Day two and the knife is basically destroyed. It looks terrible and I'm afraid to us it again. I wonder where all the broken jaggy bits of knife ended up. Probably in the french toast I ate before noticing the sad state of the blade.
1,"I am convinced that there are two Dershowitzs -- the sometimes rational thinker and the biased, arrogant law professor. I got the book on the assumption that I would get the rational Dershowitz. Wrong. This is much of the same drivel you see in several of his other books and writings. Sexual McCarthyism is an intriguing concept but don't expect to learn much about it in this book. Keep your receipt, you'll want to throw this one back."
1,Just finished episode 2 of season 1 and decided to sell it again. I was not able to find some decent acting besides Tim Roth. His female sidekick is as bad as Cuddy in House - besides personal assistant look alike dresses there is nothing that she brings to the table. Did not like the stories either - I fell victim to the hype on the recommendations page for this item. I like Tim Roth though and I am happy he (hopefully) makes some money out of it. Glad to have sold it as I write this to minimize my losses.
1,"I wasn't able to play it on my computer, even after I downloaded and updated adobe. I don't know why I wasn't able to play it. I have bought other movies in the past and they always played well."
1,This seems to be a pretty good band but the cover of CH's 'dream' is basically note-for-note. Even the solo's are virutally the same. Neil Finn's sincere lyrics sound very disingenuous here.
1,"Once I start reading a book I like to finish it, but this one was a waste of my time. The first part is so slow (picture the turtles in the internet speed commercial.) The pace picks up in part 2, but still not worth reading. The main character, Alice, never seems to change or grow emotionally from the beginning to the end. Actually none of the characters do. Most people learn and grow as they get older, but in this book they just keep on being damaged because of a lack of attention from the mom.There were parts of the book that were rambling thoughts that made no sense at all. Others where Alice is telling the story then all of a sudden the writer is talking about Alice.I read the other reviews, so I know people enjoyed this book, but for me I would not recommend it to anyone."
1,"The link this book makes between autism and diet is facinating and should be explored further. The link between MMR and autism has been researched endlessly and found to be untrue.As a parent of an autistic child I will try the diet recomendations. I have friends who tried the diet and while it did not help the autism it did greatly reduce the temper tantrums. It's certainly worth a try, but I don't hold out much hope."
1,I bought this when my kids were little. I am going through some things to get rid of and kind of remembered not liking this video. I am watching it again now and it's going through the numbers and when it shows a number it only shows one picture of the item almost every time no matter if it's a 2-10. This seems confusing to me! It's also strange that they put learning numbers with learning time on the same dvd. Numbers might be for 1-2 year olds and time would be for kindergarten or 1st graders. The music portion is very poorly done too. It's all very boring. I don't even dare give my dvd to goodwill. I don't want anyone else to waste money on this.
1,"Before purchasing this product I read several reviews, one of which made reference to the unit changing temperature on its own. I experienced this same proble. I set the temperature for red wine at 58 degrees per the instructions but noticed a fluctual of as much as 5 degrees. When I called Avanti the customer service department was of no help. When I asked to speak with a supervision the line was disconnected. I have yet to receive a reply to either my repeated telephone calls or e-mails.I would not purchase any Avanti product in the future."
1,Don't buy. the container its smaller than half of a finger. and gave my mother itching in the skin. its not what you expect please do not waste your money

1,"Very low quality. Candy arrived in a plain, transparent plastic bag with no markings except stock number. No country of origin, no brand name, no ingredient list, no description, no dates, nothing ! The black licorice (I really doubt it is licorice) tasted disgusting with an after taste that lasted for an hour. The colored pieces were all smeared with the black licorice making the entire mess very unappealing looking. The black pieces were also stuck together in clumps. I've had good licorice and bad - this is the worse I've ever had the misfortune of trying. It was supposed to be Bassett's brand, a decent product, I can't believe it really is. Also, another reviewer mentioned it looked like floor sweepings, I think they are right.One final question: How can a 5 lb bag of candy have a shipping weight of 4.6 lbs ?"
1,"this licorice was not as fresh as they said and I don't think i would buy this again, nor would i recommend this product to my friends or family"
1,"The opening credits in the film ""Candyman"" state that it is based on ""The Forbidden"" by Clive Barker.Only later did I learn that it was a short story and not a film by Barker that the movie ""Candyman"" was based on."
1,"I chose this book because ""Awareness"" is in the title. Although I wasn't expecting a lot of nuggets, I did expect some. Unfortunately, none were to be found. Instead, this book reads like a session with a psychologist - and not a very good one at that. The author begins by writing, ""If you have picked up this book, then odds are that in someway you feel dissatisfied with your life."" Again, that is not why I chose this book. Warning - this is the theme of the book. The author's own words sometimes weigh down the pages with emotional dissatisfaction.Much of the advice is written in generalities. Often times, emotional issues were lumped together as if a one-off, cure-all by being ""aware"" will resolve any and all emotional problem. Sure, awareness is the first step and yes, gaining control of your emotions is important. However, if you are looking for sound emotional advice, you should see a licensed professional."
1,I ordered this book because I wanted to have a different opinion of our president than the one that I presently have. I am sorry that I spent the money and time.
1,"Barack Hussein Obama's latest book ""The Audacity of Hope"" is a failed attempt at writing. In this book, Barack Hussein Obama claims that we need to ""reclaim"" the American dream. Yet all around us Americans are achieving their dreams. More Americans own homes than ever before and the economy is stronger than it ever has been. There hasn't been a terrorist attack on American soil in years, and Iraq is a free Democracy when just a few short years ago Iraqis were being gassed by the terrorist Saddam.Clearly we don't need to ""reclaim"" something that we already have. We are living the American dream thanks to pro-freedom policies enacted by great presidents like George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan. Now is a great time to be an American, and a poor time to be selling Americans lies about how miserable things are. Sorry Barack Hussein Obama, I don't need to reclaim the American dream - I'm already living the American dream."
1,I was so disappointed in this book. I was prepared to be wowed and instead I was bored. The pedantic style and monotone narrative was a big turn off for me.
1,"I was hoping to find reason to vote for Senator Obama, and made a game try to get through the book. What made it so hard to read? Misconstrued, incomplete ideas wrapped in ""feelings""? I felt better when I put the book in the bottom of my trash barrel to save others from it. But I felt worse when I worried that it might appeal to them."
1,"Pretty much what one would expect from someone with a limited understanding of how the world works outside the South Side of Chicago. An admirable individual no doubt, and one suitable to work as a community activist, but Mr. Obama's idealism seems incredibly naive when faced with fighting terrorists who won't hesitate to kill 3,000 innocent civilians or saw off the heads of reporters. His apparent lack of education of history and basic economics is breathtaking, and if elected, will lead to a four years of chaos and a return of Republicans to power. Yes we can...."
1,"We all need to know what this president's goals are, the worst of which is the dismantling of our Constitution. If you can stomach it, you should read it. Just remember: ""How do you tell a Communist? Well, it's someone who reads Marx and Lenin. And how do you tell an anti-Communist? It's someone who understands Marx and Lenin."" -President Ronald Reagan"
1,"Okay, I wanted to read this book because of the recent campaigns...I thought it would help me clue in to the man himself. And it does, he is a genuine man with a lot of heartfelt motives. But to be honest, he's better at speeches. I closed this book before I finished the first chapter and stacked it away on a shelf. It would be great for a person who is completely aware of political agendas, history, current events. For me, no thrill here, none at all. A lot of name dropping, names I didn't have a clue about, and a lot of political ramble that truly went in one ear and out the other. So if politics is your thing then this is your book but, I prefer an interesting read. Can't waste my time in that one."
1,"What will Barack's new book be- ""The Audacity of a Marxist""? This man is not brilliant (any man who is dependent on a teleprompter does not have much ""up there"") and all he does in these books & elsewhere is preach his radical Leftist ideology, framing it in clever words like ""Hope"", & ""Change"". Interesting that the Barack Obama Wall Calendars are falling steeply each year in their appeal to people. The 2009 wall calendar had about 50 positive reviews, but the 2010 calendar had about 12 total reviews, and his 2011 wall calendar has a paltry 2 reviews. Hah! People aren't buying into this snakeoil-saleman's ""hope & change"" anymore!! God bless America and protect her against such anti-American, anti-hope people like Mr. Obama."

1,"I can't believe a man like this would even be considered president. This man doesn't place his hand over this heart during the pledge of elegance, and doesn't say the pledge.He is full of empty promises. For one universal health care. Universal health care doesn't work. Look at Canada. If you get cancer you have to wait in a ""line"" before receiving treatment, by time you receive treatment it may be to late.Canadian doctors won't perform surgery unless they know the outcome is better than 80%. There are 1000s of Canadians who come to the US for surgeries. Why would we do this to ourselves?If this happens to us, where are we going to go for surgery if our surgeons aren't going to perform the surgery? It isn't because they don't want to. When health care is free they have to be selective with how they spend money. This guy will only hurt the US."

1,"The best Mr. Kay can do at characterizing the ruler of Gorhaut is to have him force another man's wife...during a council meeting. Obviously not a book for children, or for anyone unwilling to have Kay's attitudes about the characters beaten into their heads. He would have done better to have assumed the omniscient tone and said: ""He was a very, very bad man.""This book takes Tigana's flaws and elevates them into odious art, but it has few of Tigana's virtues. END"
1,"Having thought about it further, Doyle's book is a farcical misrepresentation. Here's why:Funakoshi emphasized:""You must be deadly serious in your training. When I say that, I do not mean that you should be reasonably diligent or moderately in earnest. I mean that your opponent must always be present in your mind, whether you sit or stand or walk or raise your arms. Should you in combat strike a karate blow, you must have no doubt whatsoever that that one blow decides everything.""Karate-Do: My Way of Life; Funakoshi Gichin, pp. 105. Kodansha, 1975His words are located precisely in the section of his book called ""IMPORTANT POINTS."" And you guessed it; that statement is point #1."
1,I bought these because I read the other reviews and one said the scent isn't strong. I think that person just likes perfumy things or we have a clogged nose issue.DO NOT BUY THESE IF YOU HAVE ALLERGIES AND DON'T USE PERFUMES!They are so strong smelling that as soon as I opened the box I was about bolled over. I had to chuck the box into my garage and I am sitting at my computer wondering how I will get the smell out of my house. I intend to call the company tomorrow and complain.I don't see how I can even use one sheet and I am stuck with 6 boxes!Sept. 26 update. I finally tried using them and the strong smell thankfully did not transfer to the clothes. Yey! I still have to store them in the garage though but I'll now give them a 2 instead of 1.
1,I love the glasses but i didnt realize one was chipped until after id ripped the box. Very dissapointing since you have to return the whole set when this happens. It wasnt worth $3 for the broken glass for me to drag all my kids to the post office to return.
1,"I first became acquainted with Mr. Johnstone's wonderful series four years ago when I discovered his first novel in a used book store. I have, over the years, managed to collect a copy of each succeeding novel in this series and until now have spent many a happy hour reading and re-reading the Ashes books. Until now!For some reason Mr. Johnstone has written a book that seems, to me, to be a feeble effort to keep the series going. Like many of his readers I am more than willing to put up with pages of flash backs to other novels, his political agenda (much of which I agree with) and his latent homophobia, IF the end result is a good read, which this, his latest effort, is not.I would much rather have waited another year and read another fine, cracking tale from Mr. Johnstone's pen than this drivel.A major disappointment and I sincerely hope that Mr. Johnstone will return to us the fine novels he writes so well."
1,"I have followed the ""Ashes"" series from Book One. There was adventure, action, a feeling of like purpose righting wrongs. A quality series. But the last book leaves much to be desired from a trusted author. Maybe its time to end the series, devote the energy to the old quality of giving the reader a true action series."

1,"My God, where is Shawn when we need him? Lillian Ross' paean to Bill and Tina needs Shawn's ball-pointed editor's pen like potholes need tar."
1,"How can Ross claim that William Shawn never knowingly hurt anyone? Surely his wife would disagree - and so did this reader. Ross's unfathomable sycophantic treatment of current New Yorker editor Tina Brown seems self-serving and needless. More on the brilliant Shawn, and more emotional honesty (Ross's) would have helped this strangely withholding account."
1,"I just purchased the above phone for my parents. I did so based on the excellent reviews from others that appear above. I must admit, I was sceptical in doing so, since I own a Casio/Phonemate product which I am unhappy with. My skeptism was justified. The display on the phone is barely readable, just like mine. When my mother used the phone for the first time, she said it sounded echo-ee. I have a Phonemate cordless phone which is about 7 years old. It was excellent. However, when Casio merged with Phonemate, quality went down the tubes. There is no doubt the phone has many nice features, but does a poor job with the basics such as sound quality and display. Stay away from this one."
1,"While Smith is to be commended for his advocacy of minimalism and simplicity, this book is of little practical use in designing a house. It's tiny, for one thing, and contains very few useful technical drawings and very little factual prose. The prose and drawings aren't inspirational in an abstract way, either -- mostly, they're just mushy, New Age-ish platitudes about minimalism. They're not worth the cover price. Check out Tremblay's ""Small House Designs"" (ISBN 0882669664), which is far superior and just a few bucks more expensive."
1,"THE SLEEPING TIGER is a terrific film with a knockout performance by Dirk Bogarde in his first collaboration with director Joseph Losey.It deserves to be seen in a clear print. This Synergy Entertainment DVD and its smudgy print is a travesty. Do they preview these films before they sell them to unsuspecting buyers?If you can't play a reg. 2 DVD, pristine image from Optimum....... get the reg. 1 ""Dark Crimes - 50 Movie DVD Set"" from Mill Creek Entertainment under $12 for 50 films. Don't be put off by the ""50 movies"" bit. Their print of THE SLEEPING TIGER is as clear as you're going to get, and as good as the Optimum. I stumbled on this great find and was amazed. It's also available through some interlibrary loans so you can check it yourself.Good luck."
1,"Another made in china useless piece of junk; readings are off by 10-12F. Don't buy this, invest in a decent thermometer instead."
1,"I know and have heard C.J. Cherryh is a popular science fiction author -- but I have to agree with the other reviewers of this book; this book just had little if anything to do with ""Lois & Clark"" the TV series. I'm a big L&C fan (even the president of what was/is the largest ""L&C"" fan club on the Net), but I have read so much better. Find the fanfiction archive and look for Debby Stark's ""Dawning"" series for example, or the story ""Full Circle: A New Day"" by the TUFS staff, and I'm pretty sure you'd be a lot more fulfilled than this book would ever make you."
1,"At least the original ran for an entire season. This ""reimaging"" lasted six episodes before ABC pulled the plug and took it off life support. Despite the participation of people from the X-Files and the original Night Stalker. What they forgot was the sense of fun of the original and turned it into something darker than Millenium! (Hard to imagine.) Carl Kolchak is a bumbling reporter trying to get back to the bigtime who continually encounters stories that no one can believe. In the new version he is not rumpled Darren McGavin but a rather more urbane Stuart Townsend. Driven by the mysterious death of his family he is on a quest to uncover the truth. (His companion is obnxious). For completists."
1,"I'm going to be brief, I had high hopes for this book but it failed to entertain me. The art was by far Bryne's worst work ever nor was his writing particularly good. He fails to follow threw on any plots, the characters have no motivation and Diana is so hideously out of character it makes me cringe to think about it."
1,i didn`t like this. You need a whole bunch of stuff in order for this to work.. Warning most people will probably have to return since they don`t have all the 12 things u need for it to work
1,"Don't buy, I got this toy for christmas for my Batman fan and what a disappointment to me and him. opened it the day after christmas and the batman car would not go around the track I went to toys r us and waited on line for 45 mins to exchange for another one which they had and when I got home, yet another disappointment same thing happened , needless to say my son was very upset.

1,"Don't buy this book. It is a fast update of a previous edition leaving way to many errors in the text. The provided tests also contains errors, some of the questions are about AWT - a topic no longer on the test. And the samples promised by the text is not on the CD ROM as otherwise told.All this leads to frustrations and I recommend you not to buy this book"
1,"The Sun examination is much trickier than the sample examinations in this book. I dutifully read the book and took the tests at the end of each chapter. Today, I took the author's practice examination and got a 96%. Great, I'm ready. I then went and took the Sun examination and got 69%. These authors have stung me twice; I had the same experience with their Java 1.1 book. This book is worse; it has numerous typos, and even the chapter numbering has errors in the answer section. My big complaint is that they do not provide you an accurate feeling of the Sun exam, but make you think they did. One of the authors claims to have authored the Sun exam; I wish he'd made some effort to illustrate how ""nuanced"" it is in this book. Caution: do not use this book as the sole preparation for the exam."
1,This book is the worst book for the exam. You would be better off useing online study guides. The CD the book comes with contains out dated exam questions that contain AWT and Input/Output IO content. The book it self contains some good info but seems like a rush job. The chapter summarys are some times at the end of the chapter other times they are scatered with in the chapter at the end of individual sections. Their is also a chapter in the programmers section on I/O that doesn't pertain to the exam. Authors excuse is that it is preping for the Developers exam. HELLO!! Put it in the developers section!
1,"I originally was attracted to Bebel Giberto because of her voice & the main reason beacause of the track ""August Day""(THE KING BRITT REMIX). If you have'nt heard it, its banana's(I love it). I can't say that Bebel is my favorite artist but I do enjoy some of her songs. The rest of her songs put me to sleep,but someone must enjoy them beacause she has 4 freakin album thus far. If she had more songs like August Day Song & Aganju',she would have a big fan in me."

1,"The other reviews are correct. You WILL feel cheated. The box is very well done. Even if you meticulously read the box,(it does describe one balsa fuselage and balsa wing with other cardboard wings) the size and box art will convince you that there is a durable, old fashioned model airplne kit inside. When you open the relitively large box your heart will sink to see a single thin metallic envelope inside, and about 90% empty space. It is upsetting to realize that someone purposely designed that box to mislead..."

Won't even bother sending it back for correction, because within the same order was the set of four controls for the top burners. These were much smaller than the original and with all the adapters sent with them, NONE would work. The whole ordeal left a bad taste for this supplier and will not use them again.Tim Scott"
1,I was so excited to get this fish. It was a Christmas gift. It arrived on time and I peaked in the box before wrapping it and giving it to my Daughter and Son in Law. She was very excited about the fish until we took it out of the box. The bottom of the tail had all the paint rubbed off. I was upset and told her I would return it. She refused because she loved the mailbox so much. I wish I would have removed it from the box instead of peaking before I wrapped it.
1,"I plan to put this film on my worst films ever made list. I mean it was absolutely terrible. It [is bad]! It's only redeemable quality is that you could back and crack on how stupid this film is with friends while you are less than sober. There is a [pjysical gratification] scene that is perhaps novel for 1980, yet of course it's not worth getting this film over, I had more fun watching Hobgoblins that was made around the same time."
1,"I was hoping to have found anonther of Wister's classic western stories such as ""The Virginian"" and ""Lin McLean"". I should have done my homework first because it's a pre World War I travelog /essay. Not very interesting."
1,"I haven't actually read this book, but from just skimming it, I see that it contains no exercises at all. Without any exercises, it would be really hard to use this book for self study, and hope to retain the material. Based on the reviews, it looks like the better books available on the topic are ""Geometry, Topology and Physics"" by Nakahara, and ""The Geometry of Physics: An Introduction"" by Frankel."

But, like everything else they don't make them like they used to. On about the tenth use, I turned it on to heat up and it made a popping sound, started to smoke and the handle melted. I had owned it for 35 days, (five days past Amazon's return policy) so I can't return it. I'm stuck sending it back to the manufacturer and paying shipping both ways. Boo!"
1,"This is a terrible straightener. It causes extreme breakage, it burns your hair off, your hair lacks movement(frozen) even the wind can't blow out your hair , and your hair becomes frizzy in a matter of minutes. I don't recommend this product for African Americans with virgin hair."
1,"Sorry guys, Home Depot has this same set for $32 and change and they are 8 piece sets. I like them so much, I bought 3 sets! I highly recommend quick grip products, you can never have enough. I gave this 1 star because this is not the best price."
1,"I had to get a saw and my wife came back with this piece of junk.It will cut a plank in half, but should you need the cut to be 90 deg, forget it.Dont adjust the angle just bend the base back to 90 deg, it will bend out of true again, so why bother. Just throw it away. Junk.Thank you B and D for your waste of resources."
1,"this saw can not make 90 degree cuts. also, the sole plate is cheap metal and will bend under any pressure, so even if you use a square or other tool to set an accurate angle, it'll bend under pressure and warp while cutting.i've used it to cut through concrete with a cutoff blade, plywood, oak, etc. and it works fine as long as you put a decent (eg - sharp) blade in it. it can rip boards with a little care and cross cuts fine.this model also doesn't have a blade-stop switch or button, so to remove the blade you need a scrap piece of lumber to hold it in place while you loosen the screw with the wrench."
1,"Having read Dale Carnegie's work, which this book references, I expected something more. I was disappointed. The book attempts to recast a small subset of Carnegie's principles for a younger audience, but doesn't do a very good job of it."

1,"If the title was AMATEUR Web Parts, maybe it would be worth something - to an amateur of course :-) First a professional wouldn't publish a search and replace ""translation"" from a VB code which was never ever even compiled, and amateur might. Then a professional wouldn't write a code for publication in VB in the first place, since he would know that potential reader of his book, being a professional programmer, has zero time to wade through VB-anything and needs working C# code on the spot - and amateur might.Since Wrox was avoided publishing even a table of contents on Amazon, let alone a chapter etc. let me quote a little example of a completely amateurish thinking/writing : ""think of full-fledged Web Parts as custom controls with superpowers"" :-) What can a professional do with such ""explanation""? Return the book and click on MSDN pages ..."
1,"This is probably where the SCBCD exam is, but I was a little disappointed to discover that it only covers EJB 2.0 and not EJB 3. Probably a waste of time for most people certifying on older technology when a new version is around."
1,"Bought this after reading the early ratings here and on Cnet. First one replaced under warranty, company was just OK to work with but a pain to return and cost me shipping. Have tried/tested NUMEROUS BT headsets. The ""environmental mode"" is a total gimmick and in my opinion - worthless. For the money, the Plantronics 510 can't be beat, if you don't mind the bulk or the Plantronics 925 if you don't mind sacrificing a little sound quality to get smaller size."
1,"Shocked, I was. After reading such great reviews, I chose this item over the Jawbone and my former JX10. I chose...poorly. This thing simply fits terribly, has lots of static and fails to impress on any level. The fit was probably the biggest surprise. None of the three earpieces works well. Having to hold the buttons down for long periods is annoying. The ear loops is always moving into the wrong position. The ""environment"" settings are essentially a joke. In the end, I'm just using it until I can either replace my old (RELIABLE) JX10 or try out the Jawbone."
1,"Purchased two of these - arrived quickly; HOWEVER - after placing them both into 3 different new Lexmark printers, all 3 printers reported that the cartridges were EMPTY, and would not use them. Had no Lexmark markings on them (Supposedly ""remanufactured"", but apparently not correctly).Looked like a good deal on Amazon -claim to be ""Lexmark cartridges"" - but not worth the postage.DO NOT BUY THESE."
1,"It appears that the high yield functionality of the #34 cartridge isn't such a great deal after all. Rather than providing more ink, Lexmark has just dialed down the amount of ink dispensed per print. What comes out crisp black with regular #24 cartridge appears dull gray with the #34 (we compared prints). Even worse, the quality settings in the printer software don't allow you to choose higher quality. As if these cartridges weren't already enough of scam now Lexmark will let you pay more for a lower quality product and not even make this difference clear in the product description."
1,"Sorry ! I could not read this document. If I was a Kid, I would not have any trouble but I am 72 and not up-to-speed on computers. I ordered this report, paid for it, but where is it ? I can order stuff on the internet. I ordered books from Amazon before, but never a Download. So, I'm gonna try again, but if you can help me, or if you could print the report and mail it to me, that would be great. Tell me how many extra bucks you need for that. Thanks ! Jacques Linder"
1,"Though Dewalt's generator is the best there is, please keep in mind that you are buying this product from Amazon. In our case, we did not know the unit itself was damaged in shipment, though there was minor damage to the box in which it came, until after we tried to start it. In order to start it, we had to put oil in it. Because we put oil in it, Amazon would not back up the purchase. We were completely on our own. In other words, if there is any minute evidence of damage to the container in which it is shipped, do not give Amazon the benefit of the doubt. Assume the unit is worthless. Send it back."
1,"The acting is okay but the movie is not thrilling to me. The action scenes are so so. Overall, it's not interesting."
1,"Clooney is usually a pretty fair judge of material but this right wing, chauvinistic wanker is over the top.Unviewable; I had to cut out midway through the movie."
1,"This is great stuff if you're a 15-year-old male. All action, a thousand people die, and the hero and heroine come through with scratches. Car chase. Gore. The usual. Except that the idea of young Ms. Kidman as a top governmental official reporting only to the President is exceptionally ludicrous."
1,"I saw this when it first came out. Maybe because of all the explosion and shooting, I didn't realize how stupid the story was. No wonder it totally bombed at the box office, even with Clooney and Kidman. This ain't 007 or Die Hard, so don't try to be one. I just hope that the real peacemakers are smarter than this. If you are not ready to simply turn off your brain for two hours, skip it. But if you still want to judge it for yourself, then stop reading.1. The fighting scene on the bridge is ridiculous. Is this how US army works, I mean sending one person down to kill all the enemy, then the rest of the team joins him?2. If you know a nuclear bomb is coming into NY, you don't sit in the office and wait for someone to tell you the flight has already landed.3. You have an FBI team to capture someone, do you send everyone to his room, leaving nobody to watch the exits?This just goes on and on."
1,"I wouldn't touch this game with a ten thousand foot pole. I'm mad because I wasted 3 bucks renting it. I want the three bucks back. I should get paid to play this game it is so bad. This game is terrible. I'm sure glad that I didn't buy it. There is no story, no graphics, no nothing. It isn't a game, it is a virus that has somehow seeped into the playstation 2 market and infested it with the bad smell of a terrible and ruthless boring plague. Don't even look at this game. Avoid it at all costs. Whoever made this should pay you to play this game. I'm serious. I wouldn't play this game if I found it on the street. I would destroy it. It is that bad. NES games are ten times better. So stay away from this game."
1,"I don't expect a game to blow me away with story, actors or any other things that goes into a movie. Because it's a game. It's just for fun. With that in mind I try not to rate games too harshly and also because there is usually some reddemming quality that I come away with that is good. But not this one. The game just starts. No intro, nothing to show what is going on or why. Just straught into a Blood omen clone that ... There isn't any story in the whole game. Just move from place to place and kill things. There is no real reason for it. There really isn't anything good in this game. It is years dated and uses nothing of the ps2 power. Metro 3d just put this sorry excuse for a game together and then hoped we the gaming community would waste our money on it. There may not be alot of rpg games on the PS2 but they are coming. Save your cash for the good ones."
1,"I was going to be one of those folks who just ordered a new set rather than pay the ridiculous price of replacing the batteries. But the set I ordered, which clearly shows the item with the large sized batteries, came with the much smaller batteries that are about 1/2 as tall. So back it went without ever taking it out of the box. They apparently get away with that enough to keep doing it, even though in my case it was a double shipping cost to them with no revenue.I'll also mention that around the same time I found out through a local mechanic who stocks Interstate batteries that you can send in these tool batteries and Interstate will rebuild them--not just Dewalt, any such battery that's not in a sealed case. Here they cost me $45 each plus sales tax. Not cheap but better than most anything else I've found. And if I do it through my mechanic who gets regular visits from the Interstate truck, there's no shipping"
1,I needed and extra screwgun recently so picked this one up for $99 from AmazonConsChuck wobbleMotor smokes when drilling (eek!)Batteries overheat really fast (less than 30 seconds)Little power for a drill.ProsIf all you need is a cordless powered screw driver this is mediocre.In Summary.Disappointed with this purchase - I will stick to my older XRP 18v Cordless Dewalt for drilling and use this drill specifically for light screwing.
1,"Drill endurance is terrible. 5 year old Panasonic 15.6 volt and 3 year old Ryobi 18 volt beat it up everyday. Protocol is 3 battery swaps in an 8 hour work day. It's only 6 months old. Bottom line, A RYOBI OUT-PERFORMS IT! My co-worker calls it a yellow Ryobi and laughs at me everytime it dies in action.I will continue to use it because it cost 199 dollars and I cannot afford to try my luck with something else right now. Service center was dissapointing as there is no recourse for a sub par product. You live, you learn."
1,"I noticed a little more energy, but not much else. I am not sure that I'd recommend this product to anyone."
1,"It had a story line to it, but the character were not expounded expounded upon. When things started to get interesting between characters they took at least one character away. I do understand the writers are trying to go by how life was in the day, but they forgot to make the story interesting in the process."
1,"I didn't find this a bit entertaining, insightful or compassionate. This book is a piece of garbage and junk science, wrapped in a pretty package that panders to obese individuals. Obesity is a disease that eventually affects all organs and leads to morbidity and premature death. Trying to justify obesity in any shape or form while making it ""acceptable"" is criminal and dangerous. There are medical criteria for obesity and if you fit those, go seek professional help rather than waste time and money on books such as this one."

1,"Although this shaker looks nice sitting on the counter with the rest of the set, it is TERRIBLE for mixing drinks. The very first time it was used my boyfriend (a previous bartender) was mixing a Mai Tai and when he removed the cap to pour the drink trapped liquid spilled out of it and all over his hand and the counter. When he then tried to remove the whole top in order to dump the ice into the sink more left-over liquid spilled out of the seal between the top and bottom sections and all over his hands again! After making only one drink he exclaimed that he really did not like the shaker. I'm tossing it and going back to get the the Metrokane Bullet instead, as recommended by Cook's Illusrated. Apparently what I should have done in the first place."

1,This program does not work for all systems. Evidently there is some problems with OEM systems.If you go to their web site and find their forum you will find a they have a solution for XP Professional. It involves modifying the registry. You have to try to follow an animation rather than a step by step guide.My problem is with 2000 Professional. Backup PC will not start.I hope they develop a work around for 2000 Professional and a way to follow it without trying to keep up with the animation.

1,I bought this software as a download and didn't like it at all. Too clunky and unintuitive. Easier to use a drawing program and templates that come with all labels and can be downloaded for free. ...
1,"There is more to say about what is missing in this book than what is here. The Battle of Essling was a particularly bloody and brutal affair for such a short battle, however I felt the actual battle sequence was lacking emotion and detail. I give it two stars because of the historical accuracy and the effort. I couldn't wait to finish this book, however, not for the normal reasons."
1,"Well, if you think you will hear the song you heard in the commercial on TV, forget about it. It is not on the soundtrack.How does that work?

1,The power went out on my deck and Samsung won't even sell the necessary parts to an authorized reseller. I called to tell them and they said I would be getting a call from a NJ office. That was 4 months ago. I have not been at all satisfied with their customer service at all!
1,"Lots of information about managing life threatening diseases, and information about chemo agents, and about alternative medicines etc. Lots of repetitive warnings about not using any alternative medicines while in chemo. But nothing I found helpful in doing what the book claims -- combining traditional and alternative approaches. I can understand his concern about FDA and ethical issues re giving medical device, but this was a huge disappointment."
1,".........this isn't very good. Actually, from what I've heard about how fast and heavy these guys were supposed to be, I'm disapointed. In the past few years I've bought and listened to a fair number of metal cds, and the only 2 that I wished I hadn't wasted my money on were this one and one by the Japanese black metal band Sigh. I will say this: The Berserker are not as bad them.Yeach."
1,"While doing my Master's Thesis I had to read this book to find aout what the catholic church believe. It's a good resource for Pastors and Seminarians who need to understand the errors of the roman catholic church from their own point of view. Be careful if you are not proficient in Biblical Doctrine, because the devil can deviate you from the right path. He is a fool. You need advise from your pastor in any reading you are doing to take advantage of any resource you may need to use for your studies."
1,"Bhagwati is an extremely intelligent man. He has a lot of interesting information to share with us. Now, only if he could write better...this book is extremely difficult to read and and to understand. It is NOT recommended for those without excellent understanding of economic trade policy. There are many other better written books."
1,"This got to be the most egotistical and arrogant book ever writted. The author in about every paragraph, uses words like ""I"", ""me"" and when refering to another person and himself, he always puts his name first. Bhagwati loves to name drop, he lists people he has met as if its a popularity contest. Bhagwati's writting will confuse you and annoy you. Throught out the book he loves to advertise the papers and studies he has written, they have no relavence to the topic at hand except maybe to help him sell more books."

1,"Much of the theories and methods described in the book have been covered in listless marketing books.The line graphs that the argument is based on is based on an arbitrary positioning of the different factors along the chart. You can make any companies look like one that has opened up a so-called ""blue ocean of uncontested market space"" on the line graphs by simply moving the factors along the line.Secondly, the survey / research cited never offers clear definition of key terminologies used, no clear explanation on how the research sample was chosen and no clear list of when or where that research actually took place.It is a book that is written to wow readers with a pleasing visual image with contents that are recycled from past marketing books and arbitrary use of statistics that will not even hold on an academic level.A total waste of money."
1,"This is a very confusing map to read, and I hate it. I'm trying to use it to see where online hotels are relative to Lisbon landmarks, and I never can match the online hotel map with this map. It is much worse than the standard old fashion maps folded up from one sheet of paper. Most of the Amazon listings of Lisbon maps do not show even a low resolution of the unfolded map; however this map is so small it is shown."
1,"This current kindle version prepared by Penguin is simply unendurable. The line numbers (every tenth line) are set to the right margin WITHIN and INTRUDING INTO the text of the poems themselves. Penguin has made a business decision to offer many of their Classics in ebook form, and good for that. Unfortunately they gave the task in many instances to persons with no feeling for how the result looks. Given that they're charging nearly full price, there's no excuse for offering a product so shoddy."
1,"Not a good purchase...the screws on backs of trays scratch table tops when in the holder..Don't waste you money unless you just want to set out and never use the holder as it will damage them..have seen trays for 40.00 with better construction. The tops of the tables are beautiful, but the holder makes it impossible to use and not have scratches..Oh well, if you want just to set out and not use holder then trays have a very nice look"

1,"I ordered this wagon after looking at the Radio Flyer equivalent in a store. I didn't like the Radio Flyer and I do not like this one either. They're basically the same, the side walls are flimsy and not treated. The paint chips of easily, the handle is flimsy. Who came up with that little Grip? It's certainly not made for average hands. Everything is made as cheap as it gets. The shell is so thin, it has no stability to it.I'm not sure if I keep this crap (modify it) or send it back."
1,"I could Not follow the ramblings of his mind. The reviews from his students was OK, but not worth the purchase of this book."
1,"Next time, I will take the time to read the reviews. If you were standing there with Tom as he was talking, it might of made sense. But I wasn't so therefore it was vague and frustrating. I have a hunger for Natural ways versus old school and like to pass my books to others with the same heart. I can't even pass the book to someone else. Maybe it was Milly's first book?"
1,"Did not capture my imagination at all. Just seemed bizarre. I usually movies with unusual twists and turns. But, I got totally lost. I was not sure what was going on. Unlike Inception, which had incredible cinematography and direction, this movie wanders a bit aimlessly. I did not get into it at all."
1,"I do respect what they are trying to do in this movie, but it doesn't come to fruition in my opinion. It is definitely true that you will have to watch it at least twice to get it all, but I am not sure you will want to after the first viewing....I didn't. This is a movie that had great potential, but in my opinion it never reached it. You may disagree.I don't mind depth and intricacy in a movie plot, or even a little misdirection in order to keep it exciting (e.g. Sixth Sense), but I do mind confusion. And it was not just confusing, in the end, despite a nice attempt and maybe a few moments of drama, to me it was just plain boring. Alot of my boredom may just be attributable to the minimalist approach to this whole movie, nevertheless, it bored me. It relied to heavily on the story and the acting, neither of which were bad, but not nearly good enough to make up for the lack of visual interest in this movie."

1,"I want to love this blanket SO badly, but I just can't. This throw is triple layer which means that the first layer is orange, the second is white, and the top layer is navy. So when you're only looking at the front of the throw, it's great. But turn it around and it is bright, bright, orange. I machine washed this (on gentle) after receiving it and noticed some stray pieces of yarn in the dryer. Didn't think much of it until, after barely using it on our couch for two weeks, I have started noticing threads pulling out from all over the thing. I mean, you can seriously grab a thread from one end, give it a little tug, and the whole thing will come out. I am so disappointed as this was a gift for my husband and I feel like it could have been so much better. I feel like it is too delicate to be used regularly. I recommend looking at the fleece throws instead. I would buy one in a heartbeat if I could get my money back from this one."
1,"I just read a review about the lack of battery life. This is my reality as well. But mine never kept a charge beyond 2 days, and now it is dead every morning when I get to work. I was a Handspring user for years, with NO problems. None. I am sick knowing they sold out to Palm, (I hope they made tons of money and are on a beach somewhere!) as I would love to go back. And on top of this, I just read that it doesn't interface well with XP...to which my company just spent $$$ on getting us up-graded to. grrrrr, time to pitch it and move on."
1,"At first glance the Zire appears to be a Godsend. Fast Processor, Beautiful screen, hidden camera, however Palm again made a mistake by not offering this unit with a flash Rom. PALM is steadily behind. There are normally tradeoffs with features from model to model, but this issue causes concern for me. PALM is regularly releasing hardware that is not ready for the consumer market such as the Zire 71, Tungsten C, (Lack of stereo headphone out or mic and clicking problem. I am just not impressed anymore and decided to finally go with a Dell Axim 5 and completely move away from PALM OS."
1,"After one year and two months of little and careful use, my Zire 71 stop recognizing any touch on the screen. I researched in the internet and discovered that a lot of people who bought a Zire 71 around the same date have the same problem as I do. PalmOne just said that I would have to pay 1/3 of the purchase value if I wanted to get it fixed.So, do not buy anything from a company which does not respect your rights as a customer. This is obviously a project flaw or a defect in production batch, but they do not admit it. Ethics? I do not think they know this word..."
1,"The materials that did come with the product were fine, though of eseentially no use since the whole point of this kit is to allow kids to decorate the leather with the metal design stamps. It says the stamps are included inside, and also says they are included on the manual. No stamps. Thus, kind of useless."
1,"Caveat Emptor: This book is based in large part on interviews conducted by the late New York Post sports columnist Milton Gross, my father. They were used without the permission of his heirs, and were never checked against the audiotapes on which they were based which are in my possession and have been for almost thirty years. But what's worse is that the book is factually innacurate and the author did not even attempt to confirm what he printed. Instead of thanking the person whose work he based his book on, Rosen prints untruths about him. One example: on the last page of the book, Rosen has Milton Gross skipping Molinas' funeral and instead, attempting to cash in on his death. Milton Gross had been dead for over two years when Molinas died. He would have had to make that call from his grave."
1,"I thought that this would be a fascinating look at the Celtic Christian church. Tremayne explains something about Irish culture in the introduction, which was quite interesting. Unfortunately, it seemed like he repeated his thoughts on every third page. Further, the two investigators (in the beginning at least) spent their time in pointless bickering, in lieu of a plot. If this quarrelsome pair is the best two people that their respective organizations can come up with for a co-operative mission, what a hateful lot the rest of them must be. I gave up not very far into the investigation."
1,This book wastes too many pages covering general Grid Computing history and direction. Not enough detail on Oracle-specific Grid computing.
1,"Nasal aspirator (which is amazing), nail clippers and brush... that's the only items that worked. At the middle of the night, my 3m-old baby had a fever.. thermometer never worked, I had to use the family's one. After confirming fever and a quick call to the nurse, had to give him some medicine... but using the syringe was a NIGHTMARE and a big mess with medicine leaking all over the baby and all over my hands!! WE ended up using a spoon (not the one in the kit, which shows ml by halves like 1 1/2, 2 1/2, 3 1/2 and so on.. and didn't want to guess where the 2ml mark was) I had to buy health care items separately. It was a little more expensive than the kit, but now I'm sure everything in the health care box works!"
1,"Not Moving. Not Funny. Not worth the money. Go with the 2005 Short Films. ""Our Time is Up"" is phenomenal."
1,"I wanted to like this book as it is so highly praised by people I admire. It was a selection for our church book club and I'm glad I had exposure to Father Nouwen's interpretation of the message of the Prodigal Son, one of my favorite New Testament passages. Unfortunately it did not arouse much spirituality in me. I felt that Father Nouwen overworked the connectedness between his own experiences and the biblical message. It was a long slog to finish the book which engendered guilt in me for not being more moved by Father Nouwen's words. He was a dedicated and thoughtful Christian who lead an exemplary life of charity and service but his message here was diminished by repetition. Prudent editing would have resulted in a more readable and inspirational book."
1,"Personnally, I wouldn't want to give this movie any less than 4/10 (a fact worth mentioning since 'X out of 10' seems to be more popular than 'X out of 5', even if this site uses 'X out of 5'.That said, this movie really, really isn't for everyone. It's not even for the majority of people. It's not the usual slasher stuuf, so I guess it could be seen as dissappointing in the same way Halloween 3 is dissappointing.I personnally liked the scenes with the chacacter interaction, even if it was most of the movie.Okay, I guess its time to stop rambling... I gave this movie 2 stars and not three, because, although I personnally like it, I wouldn't recommend it to the majority."
1,"I bought this used, paying the equivalent of a rental. The movie is a little over an hour and a half so I wasted about an hour of my life watching it (because I did a lot of fast forwarding). Seeing the clown was kind of cool and the girls were all cute but this movie was pure crap. It does have a redeeming value though. It has a really neat cover which led me to check it out in the first place and looks good on my DVD shelf next to my other movies. It's a conversation piece and fast forwarding to the almost good bits for my friends is worth a chuckle. Hell, don't we buy most DVD's of movies we already saw a million times or can easily download for the covers anyway?"
1,it like this acting was nothing but a joke and the film was even the bad part of it i am telling u dont buy it or rent it i rent this movie i turn in off in 10mins of the movies the had a kool cover that only thing good about it
1,"This miserable exuse for a movie is not worth watching! Do not waste your money or your time. I bought this garbage at blockbuster because the back synapse sounded pretty good. I knew it was a low-budget movie but some of those turn out pretty good (i.e. ""CARVER"") but this was soo bad. The actors were horrible, the effects stunk, and the story didnt even make sense. I tried to sell it to F.Y.E and some other mom & pop store that buys used DVD's and neither would take it. So I threw it out. I dont know who would even agree to do a film as bad as this. I love Horror movies and books and trust me this was GARGAGE!!!!!!"
1,"This movie is betetr then the first bloody murder.this one at least has blood and gore.the story is still non exsistant and the killers mask for some reason has changed.the killer in both movies isent even who they say it is and they never even show any backstory or anyting.at least rent this one if your curious but just stay away from the first ""bloodless murder""."
1,"I really like the idea/concept, because I love just strolling around in sandals. But the problem for me was my feet got too sweaty inside. This isn't a problem for regular sandals since there's a lot of air, but when it's enclosed like a shoe it gets all sweaty. Suppose you could wear socks, but that defeats the purpose of sandals."
1,I was surprised how huge these made my teen son's feet. Looked like clown shoes! We returned immediately for another brand.

1,The first HealthFit counter unit I bought was defective. The touch screen would freeze and type the wrong letters. I returned that unit for a replacement. The second unit was the same. I had to keep pressing the letters 4-5 times before it would register. I bought this for convenience and I don't have the time to fuss with this. It took 10 minutes just to enter 1 food entry. It would be much easier to just write it all down in a paper journal. It was not worth the money. There must be something better out there.
1,"I have boughten one of these and am not happy with it. It breaks easy and way to slow, it proves you get what you pay for."
1,"It was an out dated book, therefore the price guide was useless in determining the current values of the items."
1,Absolute P.O.S ... got it connected to my computer and set it up. Unfortunately it wouldnt connect to my Belkin Wireless router. Kept saying 0% signal and it was only about 10 feet away with nothing in the way. So i put it right next to it....still no signal....finally connected for a moment but kept disconnecting and stated only a weak signal even though it was right next to the wireless router. Tried updating firmware but nothing...read that it has issues with WPA and im not going to turn that off so its going back.
1,"I purchased a Rio 600 for my son's Christmas present. It became defective after a couple of weeks. I spent more weeks getting to tech support and running through tests before they would issue an RMA.Their RMA process says that if the unit is defective, they will replace it, provided they have replacements in stock in their service center. Guess what? They don't have any in the service center, even as they sell them on-line. They have no expectation of getting any and require that customers wait indefinitely for the replacement units.I get the impression that there is a high defect rate and it is clearly compounded by awful service."
1,"Dead on Arrival --Shouda listened to the other reviewers... Rio support was just ducky...said, ""for $29.95 we can replace it"" even though I had it only for 2 hours...oh well. I was able to return it through Apple..."
1,"I bought this 'cool rio' thinking is was going to be the end to my audio needs. I soon learned it was comparable to the title. It coulnd't handle the everyday use. Like say the backpack of a high school student. It broke within a month and rio wouldnt help me out. I'm not even gonna mention 32 mb of storage, and 64 mb upgrages cost as much as a new unit itself. I got smart and trashed that and got a rio volt. best sound investment ever."
1,"This is my first gripe review. The backpack slips off when jogging, working out at the gym, or walking across a room holding it in your hand. The little ""slider"" that switched the player on and off, upload, somehow slipped into the molding. The only way I've been able to turn it on is with a small eyeglass screwdriver. NOW, two days ago, the unit began unexpectedly turning itself off!!Unless your immobile and treat this like its a Tiffany vase, DON'T BUY IT!! I'm already looking for a replacement and never buying anything else from this company, EVER!"
1,"I bought this player off of Tigerdirect, and it was great for about 3 months. (minus horrible battery life and small storage capacity, even w/ the extra 32mb backpack). After the first three months, it simply stopped working. Wouldn't turn on, no response at all.Wrote SonicBlue, after a couple of weeks of going back and forth and finally convincing them that it wasn't a firmware update issue, they agreed to 'let' me mail it to them (at my cost) and they would repair or send me a replacement. i guess they did replace it, but after about three months of use, i am getting the same problems again. I wish I had believed other reviews about this product. If you're into masochism, then by all means, get this thing. if not, save up for an iPod or anything else but Rio. You get what you pay for... (paid $70)"
1,"Yes, the headphones are unusable and don't fit human ears, but most importantly, I had to return 2 of these units because they died after anywhere between 5 and 14 days of use. I changed the battery and that didn't help, either, so there is some defect in the manufacturing process which makes these things blow up relatively quickly.Save the money on this dud until they get it right."
1,"I was on cloud 9 with this product for about a week: wma compatible, nice headphones, etc. Then I needed to change the battery, and all hell broke loose. The backpack failed to snap back on after replacing the battery, then the off/on switch snapped and wouldn't work anymore. Within a week, this had turned into one useless product. So I took it back and exchanged it for the Intel 3000: it may look a little clunkier and the headphones aren't as nice, but it's been great so far, and I haven't had any problems changing batteries.Buyer beware!"
1,"mp3 players are wonderful! And I was in love with this unit - until the first time I tried to change the battery. The battery is attached thru the memory ""backpack"" and sliding this unit off and on is difficult. When the pins for the memory chip failed to line up perfectly, they broke - rendering this product useless. Make sure that the mp3 player you end up with uses Compact Flash cards for memory, is upgradable, and has more than 32mb of memory (32mb holds 6 to 8 songs). Good luck!!"
1,I bought this player hoping to end my mp3 woes but to my surprise. the sound quality died in one week. I e-mailed rio and talked to a technician in town and he said send it to them. but they charged me 30 dollars just to send it to them. what a sham. poor software that always crashes. please try look into a different player
1,"A poorly designed product doesn't require a whole lot wrong to be utterly worthless, so please be aware of the sheer number of problems with this piece of crap before you buy it: - Early versions (mine) have a rubberized skin that shreds the first time you put it in your pocket. It looks terrible after one day. - The product looks nice (which should impress ID magazine) but the software (PC) is heinous, counter-intuitive & circumlocutious. It is awesomely bad. - The Rio inexplicably ceases loading tunes after about thirty songs have been pushed on to it, and tells you you must get an upgrade. - The e-mail support for this product is terrible. The clueless replies answer questions you didn't even ask and skip answering the one you did submit. - My Rio has stiopped working and my call back to replace it is now overdue. - AVOID THIS PRODUCT AND PUNISH THE COMPANY BY CHOOSING ANOTHER BRAND. THEY DON'T DESERVE YOUR PATRONAGE."
1,"How can a 3 handicapper spend a year preparing & then shoot 96 & 88 in Q school ? - read the book & find out - however , golfers beware as you know what negative mental thoughts can do in golf - this book has enough for a lifetime !! I think we need success stories & not this detailed failure ! the author must have gotten an upfront payment & commitment to publish, because most would reject. i suggest "" a miracle on the 17th Green"" for a better read."
1,"This book is painful to read. Ending up skipping many paragraphs that were the author totally overanalyzing his swing or own mental state, as I wanted to finish the book figuring it would be fun to learn about the mini-tours -- golf's single-A leagues. Learned a little, but most of the book is the author self-flaggelating blather about his mental state, or lack thereof. Was hoping to hear about the background and dreams of the various cast of characters on the tours -- there might be five pages of that in a 300-page sleep-aid. Spends a full page explaining how his choice of socks ruined his round. This book is incorrectly titled. It should be ""Fine Green Gap: The Pipe Dreams of a Three-Handicap and How He Got to Write a Book About It."""
1,"Like many reviewers I encountered the apparently fatal skipping problems during playback. They started around the time the warranty expired and only got worse. Very frustrating.Years later, after learning what caused a similar problem with a DVD player (different brand), I discovered a fix. I removed the many CD boxes that I had piled on top of the player. Apparently the weight was too much. It has not skipped since!!Aside from that, the player itself/functions and sound quality are decent. Probably would have been 4 stars."
1,"Aside from the fact that as soon as the warranty expired the CD player started jamming often, I was disappointed with it from the beginning. Although one can categorize each CD by genre one can't have the player play a random selection of a particular genre which makes the random function rather useless it's difficult to have a dinner party and have the CD player skip from Miles davis to Red Hot Chilli Peppers to Chopin. These days there are players with even larger capacities. One can do better..."
1,"I was really looking forward to getting Family Feud since I used to watch the TV show. The game can be fun at time but the fusturation ruins the game. The answers have to be exact to count. One question asked something that can get on your windshield. I said ""bugs"" and got an X. The computer says bug which is the top answer on the board. For a modern game to not be programmed to allow slight variations is annoying.Even worse is some of the answers on the top answer board. Many don't even make sense and almost seem like they are made up. One that stands out is to answer something twin boys might share growing up. One of the answers on the board is a girlfriend! There are many type of answers that will confuse you.The game claims to have 1000 different questions yet I have gotten many repeats only after a few weeks of owning the game.I was expecting a much better game."
1,"Out of OVER 30 CDs I have wasted on this driver, only three have successfully completed. I think that says it all"
1,I could not believe my eyes when the package came. The box looked ok from the outside. When I opened it the poster was wrapped up like a cylinder and held closed (squished) with a rubber band. It was put in the box diagonally and THERE WAS NO PACKING MATERIAL. I have never gotten the poster to lay flat so that I could put it on the wall. The rubber band made a permanent crease. The poster is PERMANENTLY CURLED. NEVER buy a poster from these people.
1,"This is one of the worst transfers I have seen. Just don't bother to buy it. The VHS quality of the picture is much better. It is a shame that the company made no effort whatsoever to credit one of the best western profile, Lee van Cleef."
1,"OK OK I confess, I only to got to page 80, and I also have to admit, hard science in SF novels is not that important to me, nor are the mechanics of interstellar spaceflight. But to make the mechanics of space flight, apparently using contemporary science, the main interest of the first 30% of your novel and then be so ludicrously ill informed about it really is an acute embarassment. Its reminiscent of someone who was a techical advisor to star wars. Characterisation and plot development were also weak areas, in fact the novel had no strengths, unless you count the fact the author seemed in a cheerful mood throughout and quite unaware of his own shortcomings. Avoid."
1,"I was only able to make it all the way through to the end of this monotonous book by sheer determination. I have never seen the merit that others (including C.S. Lewis) have found in it. I was yawning from start to finish. When the end finally came, I borrowed a phrase from Lewis himself to place a moratorium on ever returning to this book for another look: ""Never again."""
1,"Luckily I am already an Oracle DBA or I would not have been able to make real-world sense of the material presented in this book. In my opinion, it is pretty much worthless if you are preparing for the 70-228 exam or if you are wanting to work with SQL Server on the job. However, it is a great doorstopper/paperweight (which is why it is worth one star). Yes, I have passed the 70-228 exam, but I can guarantee you my passing had absolutely nothing to do with this book!"
1,"The writing is technically competent. The story is the problem.I don't know how old Alison Baird is, but this book certainly reads as though it were written by a 16-year-old girl. There is little about the story that can be called original; even the surprise twist at the end is perfectly obvious by a third of the way through. We are given a hodge-podge of poorly-blended elements that, the competency of the writing excepted, closely resembles teenage fan fiction. Magic stones, dragon riding, hidden destinies, a token black character -- and, of course, the certainty of two more volumes to come.This book is sure to appeal to a great many teenagers. Grown-ups may find it tedious."
1,"I bought this product based on all great reviews it got. However, I had to return it because of its terrible quality. First of all, installed firmware (version 1.7) is buggy. It can't load one of the setup pages due to an error in Java script. Router notifies you that there's a newer version 1.8 available, but when you go to a manufacturer's web page it's not there. Apparently it's been taken out without any notice because of being so broken! So, because of this error I was unable to change my internal LAN speed from 10Mb/s (default setting) to 100Ms/s.Furthermore, buggy firmware is not the worst problem with this router. It has some hardware problems as well, causing it to drop packets (I was only using wired connection, so it's not caused by problems with wireless network). Network error rate (according to router's statistics page) is over 1%. This is really unacceptable and greatly affects router's performance.Think twice before buying this product."
1,"I recently purchased a package of MacIntoshes Toffee and expected it to be as I remembered it to be,wonderfuapl, chewy and a piece of heavenly candy from Canada. What I received was a new csndy reinvented by Nestle that was nothing like what I remembered. It was soft and gritty and just plain nasty. I contacted Nestle via email and was contacted promptly by their quality control department. They assured me that they had not changed the recipe and that they had nothing but positive feedback from consumers.They apologized profusely and promptly refunded both the cost of the product and shipping."
1,It seems like it would be fun but it came with the launch track mis-aligned and the Bat mis-aligned. It is unplayable in this condition.
1,"I have a problem with books written by college professors: they're written like someone giving a lecture. If you need to be lectured, you should be sitting in a classroom. I immediately returned this book and bought SAMS Teach Yourself JavaScript in 24 Hours. I have found the SAMS books to be concise and to the point. My advice if you don't like long lectures is to buy a SAMS book then a good reference."
1,"This book is completely useless for learning how to code with Javascript. It's littered with typos, which is rather a problem when trying to learn such a precise language. It seemed helpful at first, but then I got so frustrated tripping over the errors in the text that I just gave up. Look elsewhere for help getting started with Javascript, I will!"

1,"This toys instructions make no sense. in my first attempt to put this thing together, I managed to jam paper in the out-put slot and there is no way to get it out without taking the toy apart. The tape is cheap and rips in the middle (as cheap tape will), and the feeder knob doesn't have enough traction to move the paper though. The only thing this toy has done for us is make a sucker out of me for buying it."
1,"My daughter loved this, but it did take a few tries to get it started. If it jams, then you have to take the whole thing apart. The cutting mechanism would only work left to right. The directions were just okay, but no mention of how to get more paper. This is a clear marketing error. =)As much as this is a good concept. I don't recommend it."
1,"Nosefrida is much better, I tried all the other aspirators and it's the only one that works."
1,This product pulls nothing out of the noses of my one year old twins. We had hoped that it would be easier than manual aspirators but it has proven totally useless. Unless your child's nose is leaking like a faucet save your money and get the rubber aspirators.
1,Not enough suction to remove the nasal stuffies. My daughter hated it. She was scared of it and the noise. The only thing that got her attention but wasn't so impressive was the music.
1,"I used this and liked it at first, although it really didn't have a strong suction.Then it broke on me and doesn't have any suction at all anymore.Don't waste your money!"
1,"Cleanoz is much better, I tried three different aspirators and the blue dolphin is the only one that works. Bebesounds is just a musical gadget, without suction, and it's impossible to clean it correctly. After some days it stinks. So I have no idea if my daughter hate it because it stinks or due to the horrible sound. Don't waste your money with such bad toy."
1,"This product is horrible. Please do not waste your money on this. Our baby daughter had horrible congestion and hated the bulb sucker. I was very hopeful this product would be the answer to her congestion. Unfortunately, we were very wrong. It hardly has any sucking power at all, much less than the bulb, and our daughter cried just as much when we tried to use this on her. The music did very little to distract her. Save your money and stick to the bulb. We finally were able to use the bulb sucker with her and she now thinks it is a game. Hang in there!!!"

1,"It's hard to believe this is what the TOHO company has sunk too. Mothra looks like someone went down to their local department store, bought a fuzzy chew toy for dogs, brought it home and sewed some wings and legs on it. That can be the only work the ""monster"" makers did. Even funnier and more ridiculous that megalon with his dremel drill bit arms.Then there's the atrocious acting and plot, the dumb fat kid and the equally dumb and ugliest girl I've ever seen on screen. This ain't no Godzilla vs Hedorah or Rodan. Watch this on satellite if you must but don't waste money on it."

1,"There's an open source program called GPartED, or Gnome Partition Editor. It's under the GNU General Public License version 3, which means it's absolutely free and legal to download and/or distribute.It will do NTFS and FAT32 so there is no reason to pay good money for this ""Partition Magic"" trash."
1,"I disagree that this book is a good introduction to sendmail. It does not cover the basic options well, and very quickly goes off the deep end of the sendmail.cf file. It is probably a very good introduction to the advanced sendmail.cf programming that most people will never need to do.It barely mentions how to create sendmail.cf using the m4 macro processor. It doesn't cover virtual hosting well, but spends pages and pages on uucp and decnet mail. And ,it is unix-centric to the point of assuming that all users will be on unix boxes with their own properly configured hostname and sendmail, rather than on DHCPed PCs down the hall (which seems to be the current situation).All in all, this book told me little of nothing about the sendmail tasks I have to accomplish and way too much about stuff I should never have to touch."
1,"I bought the Neowrap that this is used for, and have had to buy these replacements because the original one leaked. After using the first replacement a few times, it has started to leak as well. And not just in one small corner--in at least a couple of areas on the cold pack. I think they need to do a better job of sealing edges so that this doesn't happen."
1,"If you are time-starved please don't waste one minute on this material, workbooks or DVD. I wish I could rate it zero stars. Don't worry about offending your non-Christian friends because there is zero substance and zero Biblical application. Our church group tried it for 2 weeks and everyone threatened to quit if we didn't move on to better material."
1,"Don't get me wrong, the music thats actually on this score is really great. The problem is what is missing, so much of the music in the film is not on the soundtrack. Plus, what is on the soundtrack is out of sequence with the film. I don't understand how the original trilogy had more than complete soundtracks and this one seems to be thrown together randomly. Really a dissapointment as far as the quantity. The music of John Williams deserves better."
1,"This is not what you expect from a soundtrack to star wars by john williams. He doesn't use many themes he should have used (the force theme, yoda's theme, and what about an imperial march leitmotiv in anakin's theme?) at least in a leitmotiv form. He tries unsuccesfully to make another musical universe. Mr Williams: You failed miserably!"
1,"I realize that this is a whole new trilogy and a lot has changed, many might think it wrong to compare this score with the old trilogy, but I don't see how you cannot. The score to the Phantom Menace doesn't even sound like Williams did it. In the original trilogy, the music for each character fit them so well. What we have now is more so music to fit what is happening in the movie. What I missed most was the single melody that was present in almost every piece that bound them all together. This consistency that made the original trilogy music so great is not present in this new score. So it is with regret that I give this CD a score of 2 stars. My only hope is with the next two films, they bring back the formula that made the original trilogy score so powerful and moving."
1,The product wasn't all that great. The magnetic prongs wouldn't grip like they should.
1,"I have read all problems on the reviews and agree. Having problems with swivel head only had phone for 5 months. Get white screen, locks up only way out is to take out battery and re-boot. The only positive thing about this phone is the speaker and music storage, but hard to enjoy either when battery life is less than a day. THIS PHONE IS JUNK, CINGULAR KNOWS IT BECAUSE THEY DO NOT SELL IT NOR WILL THEY SEND THIS SAME PHONE OUT IF IT IS WARRANTIED, THEY ARE WARRANTING THIS PHONE WITH THE SAMSUNG D807. IF YOU ARE EXPIERENCING ANY OF THESE PROBLEMS WITH THIS PHONE, AND IF IT IS A CINGULAR BRANDED (LOCKED TO CINGULAR) AND YOU HAVE PURCHASED LESS THAN A YEAR AGO YOU CAN GET IT WARRANTIED WITH 15 MINUTES. CALL WARRANTY SERVICE 800-801-1101 AND GET THE SAMSUNG D807 STILL HAS THE 1.3MEGAPIXEL CAMERA, IT IS A VERTICAL SLIDE PHONE WITH A BIG SCREEN I LOVE THIS PHONE."
1,"Believe it or not.I bought this phone and after a perfectly valid operation with the USB cable, this phone competely went dead.The saving grace was the excellent customer service and the prompt replacement phone i got.Since I wanted to alter the ring tone to be able to differentiate this phone from the other similar phones around me, I tried using the USB cable again. The phone software just hung this time and now I only get a Sony Ericsson Logo on the screen.As a phone with all the bells and whistles, it is very nice only if the software that it uses was better programmed.I am not sure what kind of response I will get from the customer service this time but I do hope they remain ever courteous and do the needfulIn short, NOT RECOMMENDED FOR SERIOUS USE."
1,"Everything works fine, but it can only sustain less than two days for very lightweight use (most of the time in standby status)I ordered two sony ericsson w600i from wirefly, they are bundled with cingular family share plan. Both phone are locked to cingular.Talked with sony ericsson support service, sony doubted it may be the problem of battery or phone and both of them.Talked with wirefly, they decided to exchange."
1,"This phone turns off when you don't want it to (like about 3-4 times per day), the buttons don't work well, the service is very slow, and poor (with this phone as opposed to cingular with my old phone), and the storage capacity for songs is very low--approximately one album at a time. Go for something better, at this price!"
1,"Having loved the Dope Smugglaz singles 'Double Double Dutch' and the 'The Word', I bought this as soon as I found it. It wasn't worth it....the only really good track on the album is Double Double Dutch ('the Word' isn't even on there). The rest of the tracks are short (less than a minute) mumbling pieces with no rhythm and little point to them, track 8 is a b-side from the Double Dutch single, or full length tracks with none of the charm of the two singles. Sorry, Dope Smugglaz, but this is a poor show considering what you're capable of... My recommendation would be to get the Double Double Dutch single, and watch the video on it instead, because it's fantastic. This album, however, gets the thumbs down."
1,"It's amazing how this student film-maker manages to get money to produce these low-life productions. Who ever told Spike he could make ""quality"" movies must have been as disillusioned as he. Italians must have beat Spike up during his childhood. I don't understand his fixation with underminding Italians. And how about that oscar performance Spike displayed? Way to go into the sewer, Spike. Grammer school plays have actors with more ability. Yet another example of how poor the industry has become. Amazon needs to have a NO star ballot. Giving this bile a star is pure pity."
1,I dont understand why people rated this as a good movie. I found it to be very boring. The pointless nudity and nudity. How many times did we need to see John Leguizamo's butt. If you want to see a better Spike Lee Joint see Crooklyn.
1,"I Feel Spike Lee is a Film Genius but he has had Duds.and this is one of them.This Film Trys Too Hard Too Capture a TIme PEriod.if i didn't know that this was about The Son Of Sam',I would have thought this was a 2nd tier take or Spoof on Boogie Nights.John Leguizamo is still one of the most Underrated Actors Today.He does really well here also Mira Sorvino&Michael Rispoli.but alot of the film is Missing Structure.also since Girl 6 Spike has Gotten caught up in the Music Video aspect.way Overplaying music here too fit a Scene.sometimes it works but often it doesn't.Still I Give Him Credit for always trying something different but Knowing the Spike Pattern his Next Film will Be Real Good."
1,"This is absolutely the worst movie I've rented all year and I am sooo glad I didn't pay money to see it in the theatre. Almost every dialogue in the movie centered around the 'f' word, the sex scenes were vulgar, bordering on porn, and it dragged on for a painful 140 minutes. The idea behind the film (a NYC Italian-American neighborhood during the heat-wave, black-out summer of Sam) was a good starting point, but this movie needed direction, better writers, more developed characters (rather than so many characters) and less vulgarity. Somebody help Spike Lee make a good, meaningful movie--he's on a long losing streak!"
1,"The best thing about this comedy was Gina Lee Nolin doing a Marilyn Monroe in the first 2 minutes of the movie. Past that this might have been the most unwatchable comedy ever. It was not filmed badly, but it was not funny. How many bad, already done, poorly performed jokes can one sit through? This is unwatchable, in fact I had to turn it off. My friends that I borrowed it from tried to warn me of how bad this is, but I had to see for myself. All I hope is that the people that made this film are magicians because if they are not then I do not know how they expect to give me back the 45 minutes of my life I wasted on watching this. Again I could not sit throught the whole thing. Please never make another one like this."
1,"This is the single worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. This is not an exaggeration or hyperbole; really and truly, the worst movie ever."
1,"This movie is just not funny. It's not shocking, edgy, or offensive. It's just stupid. In the credits, it says something about the producers of ""There's Something About Mary"" ripping this movie off. Nothing in ""There's Something About Mary"" reminded me of this ""movie"" in the slightest. Maybe they stole the funny parts and didn't give them back, and that's why we're left with this unfunny non-movie. I'll admit that my sense of humor is very low-brow, immature, and childish, but I still didn't even laugh once. Not a chuckle. Not even a titter. There is no way that any human being could find this ""movie"" funny or entertaining in any way. Don't be deceived by the one star in my rating. It's not even worth one star, I just didn't have the option of picking anything lower. Don't make the same mistake I made. There's 1.5 hours of my life that I wasted and I'll never have back. Don't let it happen to you."
1,"If you saw the ad, you saw the best parts of the movie. A ""Kentucky Fried Movie"" wannabe, that doesn't come close. 30 minutes in and one semi-laugh. Save your time."
1,"Aluminum breaks apart when cycling in the gun.The soft plastic ""primer"" is worthless after only a few dry fires.At the best, these are only good for teaching people how to load a magazine.

1,"The 2750 readout gave us a number of new vehicles, aerospace fighters, warships and personal equipment to use, but what we really wanted was MECHS!!! This readout gave us a tiny 20 new designs. I was disappointed with the brief descriptions given, the non-existance of varients and the poor choices of design. They should have included some info on Star League spec. 3025 mechs too. The art work was okay and the layout was familiar."

Even in the CD player in our new Acura. Perhaps it was created in Canada or somewhere. Nevertheless, something about it is incompatible with current CD equipment."
1,"Every single song on this album sounds just as if they were all the same songs... I really WANT to like this album but... It's too boring... Try other albums like ""My Love is Your Love"" by Whitney Houston or ""Rainbow"" by Mariah Carye."

1,"If there is anyone seriously interested in computer recording I would first check out the Edirol UA-4FX. It is a fully intergrated USB/Audio interface with 4 imputs including: 1 for MIDI, 1 RCA stereo imput, 1 for a dynamic mic/guitar and 1 for a condenser mic with the option to use phantom power, and whats even better is that is all USB bus powered. So there's no need for a power pack or bulky adapter, making it completely portable for you laptop people."
1,"I found out, after the fact that this interface does not work with Intel based Macs. I called Yamaha, after looking on their web site, very, very, carefully, and they told me that they had no information about any intentions to come out with drivers for Intel based Macs. So the Money was completely waste, and the time and effort was a real bust just because they don't fully inform people about the basic compatibilities of their product."
1,"After one week the product is broken down. The quality of the lunch is poor, too fragile."
1,"In a word, other people do this much, much better. I found nothing new or particularly valuable in this rehash of other people's advice. Also, his snide attitude about other genres (particularly romance) was uncalled for.Save your money...or spend it on Swain, Bickham, Vogler, King or one of the many other useful guides."
1,"I just purchased this DVD for my sons, and was sorely disappointed. We enjoyed the first Hot Wheels movie, ""The World Race"", very much, but Acceleracers - Ignition fell very short. The level of violence is a little higher than needed, and all the characters from the first movie are now members of an illegal street racing gang (not the professional racers alluded to in the ""World Race""). The story glosses over this, but it is this kind of ""darker image"" subplots that makes Acceleracers fall short of its predessor. Mattel needs to return to the original concept (the Fabian Nicieza version of the World Race characters), and drop the ""Fast & Furious"" angle for this Family movie."
1,"Can't say I appreciated this remake which casts a black man being bought by a southern gentleman. Since Gleason isn't southern I know it was intentional. If that doesn't bother you, the fact that they spread the message on with a trowel will."
1,"This exerciser is very hard to pedal even on its easiest setting. The action is stiff and jerky. I tried spraying a little WD40 to no avail. The pedals also are slippery, and my ankle kept rubbing on the bar that connects the pedal to the exerciser. It is too big to tuck under a bed. Add to all of it, the unit I got had faulty wiring, so none of the electronics worked. Very poor quality. Not a good choice for anyone with mobility issues."
1,"I was so excited about receiving this product. The soap pump works just fine, but the lotion pump never popped up so I have to unscrew it every time I want to use it. I'm disappointed. I thought about sending it back, but I didn't want to wait for a new one."

1,"Length:: 0:06 MinsCaveat Emptor. This is NOT what you expect. It is essentially 5 incandescent Christmas tree blinker-bulbs in a plastic ball - powered by C-Cell flashlight batteries.

I suppose it's my own fault for not reading more closely.-OK - just to be fair - today I put batteries in the thing and turned it on. As expected (and unfortunately, because I actually bought TWO of these useless things) - IT IS totally USELESS. It is a WASTE of your carbon footprint to even put batteries in this (even if you DON'T believe in global warming - which I don't - it is STILL a waste even of something equally as useless AS a carbon footprint).-SHAME on the Chinese for even coming UP with useless trash like this.Oh - - you don't believe it could be that useless?Take a look at the video (uploaded from my iPhone 4)"
1,"I'll even be harder than the previous reviewer on this absolute piece of trash. Here is why. The DVD, like the previous reviewer has stated, probably has less if not only 5 minutes of F-16 footage and it is uninspiring at that. There are no discussions of flight characteristics, no in cockpit views, no comparisons to adversarial or contemporary competitor aircraft. There is nothing ""in-depth"" about it. The only footage provided are some basic test flights showing basic flight maneuvers. That footage is in the opening and closing credits of the film. The rest of the film is dedicated to the history of air warfare and it does not even cover that appropriately. The whole DVD is about 30 minutes long.Don't waste your money on this poorly constructed and falsely marketed piece of junk."
1,"This is a major disappointment as most of the beloved Carry On gang are missing. Sid James appears five times, Hattie Jacques only once and Kenneth Williams and Charles Hawtrey not at all. Laughs are scarce and it's easy to see why this series was short lived."
1,"This is my first go around with an Anita Blake novel, and I'm sorry to say I was disappointed. I thought the novel's sense of place was very poorly done, and wonder how much field research was actually done on location before the book was written. Anita Blake alludes to the Sange del Cristo mountains, when the common term for them is Sangre _de_ Cristo. A fine point, admittedly, but that's what they're called. That, and an allusion to good Mexican food, is about as far as the background research goes here.In spite of the juicily gory hospital scene, the pace of the novel's early stages was almost glacial. And finding that I cared not a whit about any of the characters, not even Anita, I put this one down.But I did give the first novel in the series a quick look, and it did catch my interest, so maybe the ennui that seemed to permeate ""Butterfly"" is more due to Anita Fatigue than anything else. It would seem to me to be a difficult thing, to write about the same character(s) book after book."
1,"Not bad, but nowhere near the standard of the series. Lots of filler in this, like LKH was stretching to fill so many pages. Anita may be reaching the end of her reign as the best hardboiled-detective fantasy heroine I've ever read."
1,"I love the Anita Blake series, but this book literally made me sick. Fans of the series will enjoy it up to the near end, with the first real in-depth examination of Edward's character, but Ms. Hamilton, child molestation and child torture are INEXCUSABLE under ANY circumstances. Two pages ruin this entire book. Skip to number ten and avoid this one at all costs."
1,"Laurell K. Hamilton is a hugely talented author. Her books have broken new ground in fantasy. She merges the old PI/detective style with an extremely well constructed universe that includes werewolves, vampires, witches, and an assortment of formerly ""oh its only just fantasy"" characters. This new recipe makes magic delightfully real, occasionally funny, and always exciting. She has used her universe to explore different genres of writing - from the aforementioned PI/dective novel to gothic romance. Unfortunately, with her latest book, she has lost her sense of fun. In Obsidian Butterfly, perhaps she was trying to merge the psychological thriller genre into her recipe. Nice try. Doesn't work. The wry sense of humor present in the characters is not there in the way it has been in the past. The characters take themselves much too seriously. This book tries to do too much. Where has all of the fun gone Ms. Hamilton?"
1,"I have followed this series, in spite of inherent problems within it (such as it being gratuitous and self-indulgent), because of the fertility of LK Hamilton's imagination. But she went quite too far for me in this book. It was badly written and edited. Her overusage of the 'emptiness' in the main characters' decription was far too 'empty' of meaning for me. And the ridiculousness of zombies zooming past quite victim-ready people to zing straight into a nursery at a hospital, several floors away from their starting point (apparently just to show how bad they were), was enough to inspire contempt. The main character and her cohorts are supposed to be big and bad, and so are their opponents, but please not at the expense of what makes sense. And L K Hamilton's insistence on continuing rape-like scenes, vampire or monster floor shows, etc has shown herself to be in a rather grotesque creative rut. I do not think I shall be reading other books in this series, or any other of hers."
1,"If you've read the series thus far, you may be disappointed by this book.Anita, ""VAMPIRE HUNTER"" leaves St. Louis to help her mercenary friend, Edward. We learn too much about Edward's real life. ""Death"" was better as a mysterious character. His real life is even sad and disappointing.If you want interaction with regular characters such as Jean Claude and Richard, skip this one.*WARNING: Child torture, abuse and molestation are included."
1,"Guys, do yourself and favor and DO NOT get this game.This is what you do....CONSTANTLY running around in a very large and tedious dungeon while pushing boxes, killing bats, solving little puzzles, etc! There is absolutely no fun in this game. You are in the SAME dungeon practically the whole game.How is this an rpg???? It ISNT!Wheres the exploration? Your in the same place all the time.Wheres the variety? Same monsters, same areas, same same same!The only good thing about this game is the cool scene at the beginning of the game, and thats it!Please Please, by all means do not buy this game. You will maybe play it for an hour or two and never play it again. Trust me"
1,"I have had very good luck with dlink 802.11b routers so I was sure the new di-624m would deliver. I was very wrong. Coverage is very poor. The router would not work out of the box and required new firmware which took hours with the help of the tech line. The routers firewall does not stealth the ports on the router and only reports them closed. After many talks with the dlink tech line they stated what I already had figured out, ""The router is not set up to stealth ports only to report them active but closed."" I was told to look forward to another firmware update in the future. Stay away from this product and check out Linksys."
1,"I loved the first four books, but this one flies by without even simple characterization. Their thoughts and feelings are glanced over, and motivations are neglected. It just doesn't make sense.If I didn't already love these characters, I wouldn't even bother."
1,I purchased a nearly identical set of ODI grips. The end caps broke. I contacted the company about the issue and they completely ignored me.
1,"Only half of this book contains anything about the TV show, the rest is about other projects the boys have done.If you are more interested in behind-the-scenes and trivia then don't buy this book - there is hardly any. Most of the goodies section is about what happens in each episode, which any fan of the goodies knows anyway.Disappointing."
1,"I assumed -- in retrospect, quite foolishly -- that I was purchasing the 1941 DVD film of ""The Sea Wolf,"" starring John Garfield and Edward G. Robinson. What a disappointment when I discovered this was a...BOOK!Five stars for quality of readability (assuming, of course, you actually enjoy reading a novel on a computer screen -- I do not!)...zero stars for Amazon for not having stated with absolute clarity that this product was a book -- NOT A FILM!And a dunce cap for me for having allowed wishful thinking to get the better of me by my failing to realize at once that there was no listing below the words ""Sea Wolf"" of the main character actors associated with the film (as is normally the case with DVDs).(A dispiriting sense of inertia prevents me from trudging two blocks to the post office to return this product.)"
1,They already made 3 TMNT movies. That should have been more than enough for everyone.
1,The first one i used broke the first day. The metal clip is very weak. Not worth the shipping to return them.
1,I just want to warn buyers that the plot summary on this is completely wrong. This video has nothing to do with Edgar Allan Poe.
1,"I hate to be a sour puss (in light of the glowing praises for this book), but I have to admit that this book really didn't do it for me. The writing is excellent . . . there's no doubt about that. However, the story wasn't very gripping or compelling. I just didn't feel the need to pick it up every time I saw it on the coffee table.When I read the inside cover, I was left with the impression that all but one sailor survived. I thought this would be an entralling story about the peril of each lost sailor and the triump of the sole survivor. That's not the case. Only one *finished* . . . which is more then I can say about how I did with this book. I stopped reading it 2/3 of the way through. There aren't many books where I'll make a 2/3 investment in time only to skip the end.There are plenty of other great sailing books about racing. ""Close to the Wind"" and ""The Proving Grounds"" were both excellent."
1,i WAS THINKING THAT THERE WAS MORE THAN ONE STORY ON THE VIDEO AND THE CD DIDN'T WORK AT ALL
1,"I am very disappointed with this drive. It worked great for the first two weeks. After that, it started disconnecting for no reason. Annoying, but not a major problem. Rebooting the drive or the computer (Dell w/XP) solved the problem. Until today. Now the drive is dead in the water. I've tried several times to bring it back without any luck. If I can't figure out something I'll be out a hundred bucks and all my backup files! I strongly suggest avoiding this drive if you care at all about the data you'll be storing on it."
1,"I bought this drive for backups. Worked great first couple of weeks; backups performing automatically as expected. Then errors started cropping up: drive not formatted for windows - reboot would clear....then it just stopped registerring as existing altogether. It just sits on my desk; I don't move it around. Pretty disapointing product. I see the reviews are mixed here, but they're generally bad everywhere else. I completely regret the purchase."
1,"The colors of this gnome don't match what is shown online. His skin is tinted a greyish green, making him very ugly. I was hoping for the cute little gnome pictured, but instead it is poorly painted (colors bleeding over their intended area) and has a hue that makes him look sick. Disappointed in my ugly little gnome."
1,"After spending 1/3 of the book reading over and over again about how the leads split years ago, I couldn't take it anymore. The characters were all shallow. It just doesn't work."
1,"Well, if you were as excited as I was when I saw the PAC-MAN Fever album was finally on CD, you need to come back to earth. THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL RECORDINGS! They rerecorded it all. My favorite song, ""Do the Donkey Kong"" was trashed. So it's back to playing my old album, which does still sound good. My suggestion is to go look on auction websites and try to find the original recording on LP or Cassette. Of course I won't be selling mine. Unforunatly, CBS records is not releasing the original from 1982 on CD yet, and may never. K-TEL did the new release on CD. Which that's why I'm all that more discouraged. K-Tel did good in the 70's releasing records that are alot like the ""NOW"" CDs. If any questions please contact me at: blackmj@2fssg.usmc.mil."
1,The plastic edge of this thing is too high so slight pressure on the sponge pushes it down and all you get is plastic on leather. Took forever to shine up one pair of shoes and had to get rid of it.
1,"These bowls are tinged grey. (I have some white Ten Strawberry Street china that I like a lot; I had hoped that the bowls would be the same color. Too bad for me.)The inner boxes were open, and just sort-of ""flung in"" to the outer delivery box. No surprise that one of the two inner boxes was full of shards. Target wants me to bring them to the store (and stand in line) or return them by mail, apparently at my own expense.Bottom line: don't buy fragile stuff from Target, and don't buy these bowls if you want to use them with stuff that is actually white.Edit, added the next day: Amazon has handled the return process in a hassle-free way, so I don't have to use Target's mechanism. Thank you, Amazon!"
1,This movie is wast of money and time there are no surprises in the story and you know how it is going to end from the beginning.
1,"This selection of Sanger documents is odd and not made with the best of care. While Reed claims that this is Sanger's ""Life in Her Words"" there is probably more of Reed than Sanger in the book, if you counted words. Each document is introduced by a lengthy and not all that well written essay, and equal weight (and space) seem to be given to Sanger's views on race and eugenics and her recipes for chicken curry. There is some very sloppy research here as well, with no attribution. Reed's biographical sketches are incomplete and in one case, ""Oliver"" Johnson instead of ""Olive"" Johnson, downright embarrassing. The fact that Reed disputes Sanger on the name and gender of her British associate would be laughable if it didn't raise so many questions about her other identifications. Reed claims a Ph.D. on the cover, but I don't think it could be in history."
1,"After multiple attempts at contacting the seller, my items still haven't arrived. They were due to arrive BEFORE Christmas. I had them planned as a special Christmas gift for my best friend who was visiting for outside the country, and paid the super expensive cost to ship them, and yet have received nothing. Sadly, my friend has already left the country, and I'm still trying to get them. The Seller responded once to an email I sent, in a very rude manner, and has yet to respond to any other emails. I'm very disapointed."
1,"After fracturing a hip, I needed to really lean on my walker, and my hands were suffering for it. I bought these pads, and at first it was nice, much softer. After two days, the white had turned gray, so I washed them. Totally useless after washing. The velcro wasn't as clingy, and the pads wouldn't fit tightly enough on the handles, so it was very irritating to keep fiddling with them. Into the garbage they went, and I just had to tough it out."
1,"Besides the mistakes in the typeset and the grammatical errors by the author, the story was possibly the worst I have ever read. Please do your best to ignore the ill-advised remarks on the back cover (and in the Amazon.com page for the book) made by Major Chavez; he must have owed the author a favor.It is evident that the author has a beef he never resolved with his Academy experience, and thus he makes the reader suffer.Please take my word as an officer in the US Air Force and a graduate of the USAF Academy, this book by no means accurately represents the Academy experience and administration. While some of his points and critiques are valid, the author blows them out of proportion with his obvious grudge. I love Amazon.com, but nobody deserves to profit further through sales of this terrible, low-quality drivel."
1,"I had been hesitating about getting this book for some time because of some of the negative reviews, but then I finally gave in & bought it because I love service academy novels. After a few pages I knew I should have listened to those reviewers & not bothered. This book was so awful I begrudge the money I spent on it! Essentially it's one long anti-USAFA temper tantrum (very poorly) disguised as philosophical musings. The so-called philosophy is really just pretentous twaddle. A novel has to have interesting characters & a plot. This has uniformly unpleasant characters, & a weak plot that's hidden by all the stream-of-consciousness ramblings of the author/protagonist. I didn't even finish it. For good service academy novels try James Webb, Gus Lee, David Poyer, Ed Ruggero, Pat Conroy. Even Lucian Truscott IV whose books I don't really care for is better than this guy! I agree with those who said this poor excuse for a novel deserves 0 stars!"
1,"If you only want cards dating back to the 80's then this is for you. I wouldn't waste your money though. Go to your local card shop and spend $5 for the same thing. This product promised specifically cards from six (6) decades and stated there were possibilities of cards as late as the 50's.The latest cards were from the mass produced era of the 80's and 90's. Very dissapointed.Description stated there are 500 cards, which there are; however, many of them are repeats. As much as 15-20 of the same card.Again, don't waste your money."
1,"I was surprised when I opened this and saw that it is straight liquid, not a grease. Not sure if I can use it at all, I think I may use a rag and put some of this on it then rub it on the base of my elliptical... We'll see how that works out though. Would not buy again."
1,"I was so excited about this product when I researched it however, there were definite issues after receiving it. 1. if you accidentally drop it, the keys will stick on you. 2. the mouse never worked properly. My suggestion, would be to find a wireless board that is more durable and has a proven track record. Good luck!"
1,I do not recommend this dvd. I think it was thrown together. Workouts are not completed and at times there are no reps for the other side !! I would hate to walk down the street with one butt cheek firmer than the other ! I found it very annoying!
1,"I wanted to like this movie because I like HGL in interviews, I love his commentaries on his older DVD's, and I like horror. Campy horror is okay, exploitation films are great, gore is fine by me. Sadly, I cannot recommend this movie. The good? Well, this is the type of film where women decide to have a ""lingere shower"" prior to a wedding and model said lingere for each other. More nudity than you can shake a stick at. The bad? Most everything else. The jokes are occasionally funny, but mostly just terribly unfunny. The acting is miserable because it seems intentionally bad (one of the hallmarks of a good bad movie is that it wants to be good). Fuad Ramses III is cringe-inducing; the music is over used and too campy; the script is closer to ""Hell Asylum"" than ""2,000 Maniacs."" If you like gore flicks, stick with the original."
1,"I""m really having a hard time getting into this game, maybe it's not for a 62 year old man who has lost all patience."
1,"According to my eight year old, this game is not very fun and too difficult for her age group."
1,"This game is suppose to be the end all to mario..Not. The way you have to use the controllers are annoying. You also have to sit through many movies and boring talking scenes etc. It is difficult to control the Character and many times you are not sure where you should be going. Tends to be confusing and the instruction that come with it do not help.Overall the graphics are good(480 max res) for Wii. My seven year old likes it because he does not try to figure out what to do he just plays wherever he is. I do not understand all the Hype. Super Mario for Wii IS INDEED A GREAT GAME. Much, Much better than this one.Spend your 50 bucks on that one not this one."
1,"I don't see what all the hype is about. This game is so generic and people only like it because it's Mario. If you took the exact same game and gave it a different title with a slightly different main character, everyone would hate it.People who love this game need to seek psychiatric treatment because they are not in love with the game but only the concept of mario, and thus, their childhood. If you look at the game itself, it has aweful graphics, the controls are horrible, and all you do is jump from platform to platform (yawn). People need to grow up, get a grip on reality and think outside the [?] box."
1,"Many associate the Mario games with fun. I associate the name Mario for one mediocre platformer from the 80s/90s and a load of marketing hype and crazed fanboys.There's no real story, the weak and uninteresting main character has no personality, the platforming has been done better before, all the ""innovations"" - most of them eon-old rehashes - feel forced, no sense of completion can be gained and the ""fun"" the game radiates seems false.I suggest playing Spyro the Dragon for PS1 instead."
1,"This product is easy to use and convenient, but the final product does not taste like Skyline if that's your goal."
1,"THIS IS FOR 1 BLADE NOT 25 AS IT IS ADVERTISED. IF YOU THINK YOU ORDERED A 25 PACK, YOU ARE WRONG.BOTH THE VENDOR AND AMAZON ARE AWARE IT IS NOT CORRECT, BUT CHOOSE TO DO NOTHING. I JUST WANT WHAT I ORDERED, IS THAT SO HARD?"
1,The Headset won't hold a charge. Battery was unchargeable. Accessory one wouldn't take it back. I had to file a claim. DONT BUY FROM ACCESSORY ONE!
1,"Let's face it. Most who watch a movie like this are either hoping for some good sex and gore and can laugh at the plot, or are hoping for a good movie despite the sex and gore. This one succeeds at neither. It is a quality film, shot with more expertise than is typical of the genre but takes itself a little too seriously. The theme of men having all the power in the 1400s is beaten into the viewer continuously to the point where you wish someone could actually hear you when you say I get it already. I would disagree on the attractiveness of women in the 7os as a few reviewers noted hairy armpits and such. They didn't have Barbie wannabees back then. Unfortunately the few scenes that actually do show nudity are far from erotic. If you are an ultra-feminist, and don't mind having your own point of view pointed out non-stop then this is the movie for you."
1,The movie was good but some parts were unrealistic. Like even if Mary-kate and Ashley did stop theives from stealing a jewel they would try hard to keep it a secret. They wouldn't keep making mistakes and telling everyone that they stopped robbers until they got to Australia.
1,"I'm having a hard time finding a book to supplement riding lessons, and this just wasn't it for me. I found the diagrams somewhat difficult to understand; if anything, they seem to make the actions they're trying to explain more complicated than they are.Example: ""Right hand: Active, rotates at the wrist, fingernails facing up; acts slightly to the left in front of the withers. Left hand: Passive, goes forward and down to yield, to allow, and then to regulate the action of the right hand"" - it goes on like this to describe what the rider's right leg is supposed to do, and the left, and the seat, then gives the horse response broken down by nose, head, neck, shoulders, and haunches.All this is to describe the ""Indirect Rein of Opposition in Front of the Withers"". There are no photos, just stick diagrams w/lots of arrows and dotted lines. I'd recommend looking at this book in a bookstore or library before purchasing it."
1,I got this set as a gift and used it once . There are so many scratches on the bowl because of tossing the salad which I did not think it will happen.
1,"I really looked foward to seeing this movie. The trailers for it were great. To say that i was disapointed is an understatement. What a wonderful idea for a movie and the director fails completely! The only good thing I have to say about the movie is that it looked great. If you are a gay man, or an African American, you will be offended by this picture. It is replete with every stereo type pertaining to both groups that is out there. The only people portrayed with any respectability are the lesbians. The men have almost no redeeming qualities. i don't think the filmmaker likes men very much. her views on blacks seems to be that they are either drag queens, mammies or happy gospel singers. get the picture. Over all a very bad movie. Save your money, Don't rent or buy"
1,I read the prior reviews. I think some were 'planted' by the producer to get more money because this movie is just flat out bad. It's like porn stars trying to act with words.Save your money folks...or donate to a local acting club in order to support some of these people.
1,"Pro: Has that Porsche name on it.Con: Big deal - still looks rather unimpressive.Suggested use: backup??Actual use: how could anyone use this hard drive for back up when it's so unreliable! And slow, even under the best of times!Drive died after 2 years of infrequent use (only when I'm editing my home movies) or backing up my documents. While a recovery was possible, that kind of defeats the purpose of 'backup,' doesn't it?Second: slow. Often, it took about 10-15 minutes to move a 1 GB file (about twice what it took on another portable HD I've used).Conclusion: Avoid."
1,"The. Photo is misleading. These aren the ""old"" silver wrapper condoms, these are the new blue wrapper condoms which feel NOTHING like the old ones. They feel like the super thick cheepos you'd get in a restroom. Absolutely horrible. The silver wrapper ones are unfortunately discontinued. Too expensive to ship back."
1,"Under ""Product Features"" it says it ias a 12-pack. Under ""Product Description"" it says it's a 24-pack. Which is it?? The price reads $49.99! If it's a 24-pack that adds up to over $2/can! If it's a 12-pack it's more than $4/can!! What the...????Amazon is joking, right?!?"
1,"I have read 1984 the book several times and I just finished watching the movie. In my opinion the movie left much to be desired. At least it didn't gang-rape the book -- it followed the plot and even the ending -- but the movie left too many things out and I get the impression that unless you've read the book you wouldn't be able to understand it. You can't really make a decent movie out of 1984 anyway. I do like the movie for being able to capture the setting of Oceania so well, though, that's why I give it two stars not one."
1,The card lasted about 3 months then just died. I'm disappointed considering the cost. When it was working it seemed to have better range than my builtin centrino web access card. I don't know if I got a lemon but now I have to check the warranty.
1,"I returned the product the day I bought it.I installed the product on my rock solid win2000 machine.I did hook into my existing wifi-network, my machine crashed 3 times and over what must have been system resource conflicts.I couldn't keep the wireless card in the machine and play a MP3 at the same time....As soon as I popped the Nic out the system was back to normal..."
1,"I have one word for this movie. Sad! Disfragmented, plotless, acting that hit many valleys and very few peaks (which is surprising, considereing the accomplished cast), the only near interesting facet of this film was the underwater town, which seems to have been thrown in as visual candy as opposed to being REALLY necessary to the plot. Do not waste your time or your money. Invest in something like Silence of the Lambs if you want to be scared."
1,"I have never heard David Knapp live but his mixing on this CD is not that great. I admit most of these songs on the two CD's are big club hits but the way they are presented on this CD; it becomes boring. I would receommend Vol. 2 of the same series to anybody which in my opinion is a lot better than this compilation. However, if you can get your hands on some singles on this CD that would be great."
1,"I really liked the first one. This one is a bit boring, as there isn't that much different to it. the camera is very jerky and it is often hard to see what is ahead which means you die quite alot which is unfair. I don't mind dying if it's my fault, but not when you can't see what's going on. I was expecting alot more from the multiplayer, but it's not that great - gets boring after an hour."
1,"Useful, but not terribly original, content undermined by smug self-congratulating boosterism. Alternates between run-of-the-mill thinking on domain modeling, pseudo-intellectual philosophical tangents, and foaming-at-the-mouth extreme programming propaganda. Deeply slanted, with a degenerate view of software engineering."
1,because american wasteland had no load time they must have thrown the load time to this game. when your in free mode it takes 7 seconds to load the next player on the list...... n64 was faster...... no customization either not a very good game this is a game that u want to rent not buy first
1,"When I first got the camera, it made a rattling sound like there was something loose and just rolling around in there, but everything seemed to be working fine. Halfway through the first roll though, the shutter stopped working. I'm going to try to fix it later, but to most people it probably wouldn't seem worth the trouble.I also have the n8000 and have had no problems with it. If you're looking to buy a Nishika camera I would definitely recommend the n8000 over the n9000."
1,Couldn't give it a one star rating because of a couple of cute scenes that rescue it from the absolute bottom of the barrel... that said it's still a bad movie.
1,"I just bought a second hand copy of this. The case said ""Jeopardy, Second Edition,"" the disc said ""Jeopardy, Second Edition,""so why am I actually playing ""The Emperor's New Groove?"""
1,"Facetious, self indulgent and virtually impossible to listen to. As the liner notes point out, it was a time of solo albums. That trapped the great sideman, Keith Moon, in a frontman's body, and it wasn't a good fit. Some engineers and marketing people took his money. Ringo Starr came along to jam and groove along. There are up to five versions of some songs on this 50-song, two-CD set, and there's no good reason for that.If you think Keith Moon could do no wrong, then you'll find nothing wrong with this record. If you have the patience to identify your favorite versions of the included songs and produce your own disc with just those versions and none of the extraneous studio banter, you'll have a more or less decent product. If neither of those scenarios describes you, then buy an anthology of The Who and remember how great a player Keith Moon was with that most powerful and precise of British rock bands."
1,"OSTENSIBLY THIS IS A BIOGRAPHY OF DOC HOLIDAY. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THE FASHIONS OF THE DAY - MALE AND FEMALE AND THE COLOR OF THE WINDOWS IN THE SALOONS THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT DOC READ THE FUNNY PAGES BECAUSE THEY ARE MORE ACCURATE. AS A BIOGRAPHY THIS BOOK IS SO BAD IT NEVER SHOULD HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED. I WOULD AVOID IT. SHE DOES ALMOST NO IN DEPTH INVESTIGATION OF HOLIDAY, ALL SHE DOES IS TELL WHERE HE HAS GONE OR WHAT HE THINKS. I THOUGHT ALL THE MIND READERS BELONGED TO THE X-MEN. SHE DOES A GREATER DISSERVICE TO WYATT EARP. SHE WRITES AND REPRINTS ALL THE BAD PRESS HE GOT AFTER THE OK CORRAL AND DUMPS ON HIM ENDLESSLY. SHE OBVIOUSLY DOES NOT LIKE HIM AND MAKES NO ATTEMPT TO INVESTIGATE IF WHAT SHE PRINTS ABOUT HIM IS TRUE OR NOT. SHE JUST WANTS HIM TO LOOK BAD."
1,"I found the graphics choopy, the Karts annoying to control, and the tracks boring. The kids and I love Kart games. We still play Mario Kart on Nintendo 64 and a Mickey Mouse racing game. Not to mention, we play CTR on Playstation and have a lot of fun with that. On all those games the Karts are cute, the tracks are fun, and so are the items. Can't say the same for this game."
1,"I wouldn't buy any more of these. It's hit and miss when it comes to putting sockets in them. Not all of them fit in order, and the holder takes up lots of space in a tool drawer."
1,The review title says it all. Once the batteries start wearing out (after about 30 min) you can barely feel a breeze.
1,"I like others was hoping for the original arcade game simply available on the PS2.Alas this was not to be.I guess it is an ok game, but they really should have given it other name.JMHO"
1,Sorry Bio-Groom but this stuff stinks - and smells even worse on my long haired chihuahua.
1,"Look, you better get the Japanese version if you want the real fun. For heavens sake, this took place in JAPAN! NOT THE USA! So why do they speak in English???????????????????????????????????"
1,"Where We Stand is a book that relates class and race. As you read you are confronted with a number of instances related to you by the author about her childhood. She does this to illustrate her point when confronted by class discrimination that goes beyond race later in the book. I read this for a College level English class and was constantly analyzing, and picking apart this piece of literature. during the course of our discussion, we came to the conclusion that bell hooks was seeing past the social constraints and looking at the real ""problem"" with society, Class. This seems like a good idea, but throughout the book I was constantly agitated with the way she presents material and argues her point, halfway through the book I put it down, I didn't need this monologue of at times childish whining."
1,The author is very direct and honest with her belief system and call to action. I agree in macro with her. She makes very salient points but then paints with a broad brush of communist talking points. I would prefer it if there was more substance and a logical layout of ideas versus angry rants.
1,"This is not a technical reference by any means. My biggest complaint is the organization of the material...it is a hodge-podge of information, most of which is geared to the non-technical manager who may be trying to justify a purchase of PeopleSoft for integration purposes. Some chapters get more technical but are confusing, lack examples and useful diagrams. The whole book feels 'rushed', and the format is far from elegant. There are several grammatical errors and typos too. For fifty bucks, I'd spend my money elsewhere."
1,"Ok, I recently got this game in a two-pack off amazon that came with Earth Defense Force 2017. This game makes me very afraid to play that one. The landscapes are barren, camera angles are odd, and the voice-overs are laughable, honestly I laughed at it. I really do try to give games a chance before I decide if I like it or not. I didn't even know who the good guys and bad guys were in this game. I was basically swinging at anything that moved. Unless you are a fan of Dynasty Warrior type games, which I guess I am not, stay far away from this stinker!"
1,"I'll be brief, this movie was not done very well. Though the few fight scenes are good, the kid and Jet do a wonderful job, the plot is laughable at best. I ran to see this VHS and it was a major disappointment. The dubbing is awful, and the dialog is even worse. I wouldn't tell someone to rent this unless they were set on seeing all of Jet's movies. Even then I would tell them to think twice. Sorry!"
1,"Yall need ta stop lying when you write your reviews 'cause then I go out and buy a cd like this that is totally horrible. As a christian and a witness for Christ, KJ is tight and I really respect what he is doing. But as a musician, These songs are poorly written and even more poorly produced. Listening to the lyrics I realized that KJ really isn't saying anything. And when he is saying something, it is so corny and cheesey that even my 4th grade sunday school teacher would hate on it. Can we give zero stars?"
1,"i hate to be negative, especially about a very talented artist, but this album just sounded like he copied ""collaborations"" and just switched a few of the words. like ""47 pop stars"" it was just lame compared to the acappela ""47 m.c.'s"" from ""collaborations"" which was brilliant. there are a few good tracks, but i was dissapointed by the lack of creativity. hopefully K.J. will not try to follow what seemed to be a successful formula when he records his next album. COME ON K.J., I'VE HEARD YOU DO BETTER THAN THIS!"
1,"I really don't like the Ultimate Sticker Book series books. I've bought several for my 4 year-old twins and found them to be very difficult for the kids to use. The pages are plain, unexciting and text-heavy -- not good for pre-readers. For pre-schoolers I highly recommend the sticker books by Roger Priddy (My Giant Sticker Activity Book is a favorite)."
1,"i really dig this song dont get me wrong but gotdamn ....boomkat is totally biting moloko's style on this.....the singing and even the production.......i would suggest moloko for the real thing...... any of their lps.....especially ""things to make and do"" and ""do you like my tight sweater"" i still like this track alot but i wouldve liked it better if it wasnt such a jack move. hope the album isnt as bad of a roisin murphy bite as this song is......booyaa!"
1,"We bought this on the strength of one TV episode (the first 20 minutes of the DVD) . Watching it all the way through, this is by far the weakest Wiggles DVD of the six we own. We just logged in to Amazon expecting to see poor reviews for 'Feel Like Dancing' and are quite surprised by the high score and rave reviews. Save for a few of the songs, this DVD is terribly boring. We're not sure why the Wiggles, or many of the reviewers, feel that children will feel compelled to dance to ballet, the waltz, and slow square dancing. Our 5 year old daughter and 18 month old son were entertained for the first few songs, then bored for most of the second half. Not sure how well this will entertain on our two 1200+ mile road trips this summer."
1,"This is T.Lin's daughter~When I was little, I grew up with the original Wiggles with Greg, the lead yellow man! They had vibrant kid friendly songs that were really easy to sing-a-long with! My mom wanted to provide my baby brother with the same experience I had with the wiggles, but when we saw this DVD, it was really disappointing. It was kind of boring, with grown-ups dressed as cats, I mean, what the heck? This is for kids! It wouldn't matter if you didn't know the wiggles before, but you should get the original instead. Even though the earlier DVD's graphics were not elaborate, the contents were much more kid friendly. I would recommend the earlier seasons, DVDs, and CDs to anyone. The newer songs are repetitive and dull.P.S.- watch the previous live shows on DVD... your kid will be bouncing along with it! Trust me, I know what fun means to kids, and they will like the originals better!"
1,"I'm really disappointed with this video. the song style is like 60s to 80s that tots never understand the wits or anything. My daughter really loves to watch wiggles but not this one.It's really boring except Dr. knickerboker song. and Sam Moran... He really sings well but I miss Greg. Still, I don't get the picture of 4 wiggles without Greg.Anyway, don't buy this dvd."
1,"This movie stinks! We have lots of wiggles movies, but this new version (with Sam instead of Greg) is the pits. I don't recommend this at all. go with one of the classics like Wiggly Party!"
1,"Unfortunately, this title is grossly misleading. The pamphlet, not book, is a report of a survey of books about Greek and Latin lyric poetry. It is not an anthology. The report may be of use to persons searching for anthologies of Greek and Latin poetry, but will disappoint anyone who wants a book containing that poetry."
1,"What a talentless hack the man was. Unfortunately, he must have been part feline so that he would survive (professionally) to mount several other ""entertainment"" ventures ( Lost in Space, Time Tunnel, Land of The Giants) only to have them reflect the depth of his imagination and creativity."
1,"Amazon's Product Description says: ""Can be used on pots, pans, grills, chinese woks, popcorn kettles, *teflon*, glass, brick, waffle bakers, deep fryers, stove parts, broilers, rotisseries, roasting & sheet pans, all metal surfaces.""On the can, however, it says, ""Do not use on (or place appliance to be cleaned on) Painted Surfaces, Plastics, Acrylics, Corian Sinks and Counter Tops, Analon Surfaces, Calphalon or Teflon Non-Stick Pans.""I spent $20, including shipping, so I could clean Teflon broiler pans, after checking the product description. Fortunately, I read the can before using the product. I usually can trust Amazon, but not this time. Shame."
1,"Just viewed this movie and yes, it's trying to be a little bit Blair Witch and little bit Evil Dead. It ends up a whole lot of nothing. The movie clocks in at 74 minutes. Much time is spend with the 2 leads curled up in each other's arms sobbing, repeatedly asking ""why, why is this happening?!"" These are definitely not people you want around you in any kind of emergency. The shocks are minimal and so is the gore factor. The ""suspense"" building up in this movie is just the audience desire to something ... please God, SOMETHING happen! And when it does, it has no effect at all. My only ""sorrow"" is the waste of money."
1,"I would rate this product 5 stars except I did not get what was promised.The reason for the low price is that you're not exactly buying a 3 pack. You're buying 3 tongue scrapers in a Zip Lock bag. So the ""color coded"" feature is entirely false. I shopped around and found several other websites admitting that you are buying a bulk pack (i.e. you're not getting this nicely packaged as shown in this photo). However, that's not what the Amazon resellers (such as reseller TeethNThings) are selling you here.So if you can live with that, you're getting a good product. I feel deceived. This is a HYGIENE PRODUCT after all. I have NO IDEA if the person who placed my tongue scrappers in the bag even washed his or her hands."
1,"Easily the worst book I have ever read! I was ten pages in when this first occured to me and I should have abandoned the book at that moment. Don't get me wrong, I love Anne Rice. Grew up reading everything she wrote. This little gem escaped me. (Thank God!) The entire premise is an insult to my intelligence. I'm 41 years old and the thought of any man my age ""falling in love with"" a 16 year old, after meeting her ONE time is just plain silly. I guess this was written for sappy teenagers of the world. And, who talks the way these characters talk? The drinking, the smoking, the kinky sex.....it was absurd from the first. And I'm the farthest thing in the world from a prude. Do yourself a favor, read the placemat at a Chinese restaurant. It will be more entertaining."
1,"This book was so stupid that I kept reading hoping that it would turn around. More than half way through the book I realized that was not going to happen. When I typed in that I wanted to read an erotica book, ""Belinda"" popped up. Although there were a few negative reviews I still bought it. What a mistake! The book has no eroticism in it. The love scenes were very underdeveloped and boring. I felt like I was reading a book written by a nun! The book borders on child pornography because I just could not get over a 40-something year-old man who was so enamoured with a 16-year-old girl who in the beginning of their relationship he insisted on her dressing in very innocent and childish type nightgowns so he could paint her and then make love to her. Please don't waste your money. Listen to the negative reviews. Those who gave it positive reviews...I think they may be referring to another book with the same title."
1,"Although promising of explicit kinky sex with underage teen beauties, this proved to be more of a story on the politics of hollywood - with very little underage sex, and even less kink. The main character is a perv, and it's the little girl aspect of Belinda that appeals to him, not really anything about HER as a person, or individual.Worth a few laughs, but otherwise just several hundred pages of letdown."
1,"Honestly, the songs on Disney CDs are less cheesy than the lyrics on this CD. Sure, the words are positive, but there's nothing original about the style. I felt like I might as well have been singing a list of affirmations to a Miley Cyrus song. Save your money and purchase motivational songs like ""Unwritten"" and the like. This CD sounds like it was recorded on a very, very low budget."
1,"I picked this one up from the library after having seen that Amazon recommended it as one of the best new thrillers. I was so disappointed. The characters are all one-dimensional and flat. And their names are bizarre... Smoky Barrett? Callie Thorne? (the name of an actress from the TV show Homicide, btw) The way they talk and the way the narrative reads is all extremely irritating and juvenile. And yes, the author throws in dime-store explanations for any typical detective work, i.e., the computer crimes detective having to explain the world of online porn, how IP tracking works, etc. It was distracting and condescending. The author couldn't decide if he was writing CSI for dummies, a pop psychology book for women who've experienced trauma, or a tongue-in-cheek satirical tribute to serial killer books. All three did not work. I'm sorry I wasted my time and sorrier still that Amazon recommended this title."
1,"A laid-back, very relaxed, subdued movie, never jolting or over-dramatic. Maybe TOO relaxed. Not the worst choice of a movie for a rainy day, though best accompanied by a bottle of wine or, if you prefer, some other central nervous system depressant. Unfortunately, I consumed coffee. Instead of the MPAA rating, movies should just tell you what to eat and drink before watching.Not much of moment really happens other than the indiscretions of several couples. I lost interest after an hour, but the thing just kept going on and on. A friend found it mildly interesting, so I listened off and on in the background, but nothing drew me back in. A yawner. No sexual/erotic/romantic fireworks."
1,"This opener is helpful for smaller lids (great for vitamin, vinegar bottles etc) however, I can't open a wide jar lid as it slips around the rubber (especially if you have used it a while). Part of this is due to the loss of strength in my hands from arthritis. So, if you have a similar problem, I suggest you get an automatic opener or try a manual jar opener that mounts under the cabinet to give some extra torque. I am buying automatic jar opener today after spending 5 minutes attempting to unsuccessfully open a jar of salsa with this product and every other implement in my drawer."
1,"Product was advertised as spray on and baked on grease/oil will come off easily. The product helped some, but did not easily remove the baked on grease. I plan to try another product to see if it works better. Sprayed the baking pan, let it sit overnight and still had to use a lot of hard scrubbing to get the baked on grease to come off. Not all the blackened residue was removed."
1,"I would agree with other users. This is a great bulb but it does not last very long. Sure there are tons of variables that will affect the longetivity of the bulb but compared to an average halogen, this bulb will only last for about a year or less based upon my experience. Buy PIAA's if you can."
1,"I love Peterson's Guides, but the birds of Mexico is severely lacking. The art certainly holds up to the standard set by the guides to North America, but unfortunately, it can only be considered complete if you tag along two other Peterson Guides. Perhaps a good addition if you wish to complete your collection of Peterson Guides, but otherwise, buy Howell's or Edward's Guides, both of which far outshine this guide when considered alone. Howell's is certainly the most complete, but Edward's guide is a bit handier in the field."
1,only for miss davis fans because the movie is not great is far from the good old histories and curriculm of bette!only the costumes are nice and the cover eye!!!!

1,"The game has potential but at the time of this writing (5/8/01), the multiplayer servers seem to be down more often than not. Also the game needs a lot of resources. Pay attention to the Recommended specification. There is an offline mode to the game but there is not much to do. The manufacturer's website has a forum with more information on the current state of things."
1,"If you are looking for a hot Maria Ford suspense / softcore / erotic movie, than don't waste your time with this one. There is a plot - yes - and the movie tries hard to develop it. The movie also teases the viewer with some nice outfits for Maria - but this never translates into any real action - which is why 97.8% of us buy her movies."
1,"I was terribly disappointed when I opened it, because I hadn't been aware that the book was in Spanish. It is my mistake. I've learned to be more careful next time I order."
1,"The plays and radio plays chosen were generally interesting -- even if more variety rather than sometimes the play and radio version of the same thing on the same disk. But the engineering and production was an abomination. The acts of ""Private Lives"" on radio were out of order, and the third act of ""Blithe Spirit"" was left out entirely. In addition, the disks were frequently flawed enough so that they stopped and skipped. It was a nice idea, but the production is bad enough to make us wary of purchasing any BBC Video productions."
1,"I guess I expected a product that was easy to use and which yielded a great cup of coffee. Instead, using the MyPod, I only got a very small (four ounces) serving of weak coffee. And still had the messy clean-up! The only advantage is that you are able to use your own ground coffee."
1,I bought these to try with my senseo but I was left with messy coffee grounds stuck in my machine and light brown water in my cup. These are not pods but just paper circle filters the same size or smaller than Senseo pods. There is no pocket to put coffee in. I would have given it one star but I used it for off label use so who knows? It might work with the Presto machine although I don't really see how since there is no pocket to place the coffee in.
1,"Why spend so much money on specialty filters for your one cup coffee pod maker. I purchase ordinary unbleached coffee filters (small), then measure the amount of coffee I like to use into it. Then I twist the top of the filter tightly, tie it off with a cotton thread, then trim the top off. I then put it into the coffee pod drawer and make my coffee! Works every time!"
1,"This is a waste, and takes more time. I make my own pods. Get the smallestcoffee filters, and fold it to fit in your machine. I have the Senseo coffee maker. I prefer making my own pods, than these or buying their pods. Get the unbleached coffee filter, its better for you, and about the same price."
2,"A thoroughly enjoyable page-turner that kept me guessing until the end! I couldn't put it down. Reece's character develops with a complexity that befits someone who has suffered a horrendous emotional trauma. I like that Brody's character is not the perfect man but rather is a bit rough around the edges, with a few flaws, though I would have liked his character to have had a bit more background to flesh it out. The relationship between Reece and Brody clicks in spite of (or because of?) their imperfections and quirks. Their chemistry is irresistible. The mystery/suspense is well done without being too graphic or violent. As usual, Nora's research in setting her story shines through. I could visualize the majestic peaks and fields of sage and wildflowers with absolute clarity - what a delightful escape from the heat of summer! A definite keeper for my permanent collection."
2,not really sure about this book...its an overall pretty good read.....it was the first book of hers i had read......more than likely i will purchase another......overall a good read
2,"I have had a bunch of drip coffee makers. Every one of them screwed up at some point, and dumped coffee all over the counter top. This bad boy does not do that....ever. All the coffee goes into the carafe, every time.Cons:1. The unit is HUGE, very tall.2. It's a little clumsy to fill.3. The level indicator is on the INSIDE of the water resevoir and it is hard to see.4. The little water filters are expensive.5. The clock/time is very, very small ... not illuminated.Pros:1. The carafe is great. Mine will keep coffee drinkable for up to six hours.2. The travel mugs are pretty neat, too. I like not having to figure out which side to guzzle coffee from ... these are uni-handed.3. The clock timer is easy to use.4. The carafe means you never have bitter, burned coffee to deal with ..... yecch.No doubt about it, this is the best coffee maker I've had. Good value, too. If you have the counter space, this is a good way to go."
2,"What a great collection of stories! I'm still trying to figure out which one is my favorite! Each one of them is a unique and personal gift for the reader! I'm betting on a second edition!"""
2,I love this high chair.(1) Set-up is a snap. You just take the high chair out of the box and it is ready to go.(2) Love the neutral design. The beige works great in our home.(3) Great Features - height can be adjusted & seat reclines at different angles & tray can be set closer or further from the child.(4) Fabric has great cushion and is reversible. When reversible side is used there is no picture of the palm tree/animals and the outer frill edge is hidden.(5) The back of the seat is high enough and cushiony enough so if my son throws himself back - he is still safe.(6) Legs fold up for easy storage.(7) Removable dishwasher safe tray.(8) Has wheels and wheel-locks.(9) Have washed cushion several times and still looks great!(10) 5 Point Harness - a must!
2,"I liked the cd so much, was suprised it was a single but when I played the cd I loved it. A few weeks later I got the whole cd and the whole cd is wonderful as well."
2,"Ankh Morepork and Klatchia are set to go to war over a newly risen piece of seabed (Atlantis was never like this - there is octopus art everywhere) apparently worth nothing to anyone - except perhaps if they wanted to start a war. Samuel Vimes, head of the Night Watch, has a personal organiser that has, listed under things to do today, the entry ""die"", and his butler has gone off to enlist. Vimes' day goes strictly down hill after an attempted assasination attempt of the Klatchian Ambassador, apparently by someone too weak to shoot the bow; Sgt Colon and Corp Nobby Nobbes go AWOL; and Corp Angua, the werewolf in watchwoman's clothing, is being held hostage and won't let the hostage-takers go. Typical Pratchett. If he gets any funnier, you'll need a doctor's advice before reading."
2,"One of the best stories ever about the idiocy of warfare & the untrustworthiness of bureaucrats, diplomats & generals generally. On a moonless night, somewhere in the Circle Sea between Ankh-Morpork & Klatch, a strange & useless piece of land erupts, topped by a weathervane. Two fishing vessels are in the vicinity, competing for equally undesirable sea creatures (the Curious Squid, so foul-tasting that they are much in demand by the kinds of restaurants that sell nasty & undesirable seafood to their customers), & each claims the land for their own nation. Of course, Sam Vimes & the Watch are sent forth to fight for their nation, while the D'regs are ready to fight back. Watch out for Lord Rust & the Dis-organizer (""Bingely-bingely beep!""). Thank goodness for 71-hour Ahmed & Lord Vetinari."

2,"This documentary includes interviews with members of the GLBT community and their personal recollections of life from the 1920's to Stonewall. The inclusion of film clips, photos, and news items along with the personal recollections makes the history both interesting and personable. Too often we take our current freedoms for granted without appreciating those who fought to gain those rights. As a member of the GLBT community and a president of a PFLAG chapter I recommend this documentary along with the ""After Stonewall"" documentary."

2,Found one of these at Walmart a few years ago and now my daughter wanted one. Walmart doesn't carry it any longer so I found this one online. I paid more for it but there's no other organizer we like as much. It was missing aside - came with two lefts. We called the 800 number and Hopkins quickly and courteously shipped the missing parts.Many thanks!
2,"I love dark grinding end of the world jungle. but this, this is as another reviewer said, high life, champagne flowing, overlooking some dope city scape. it is beautiful, and the anger from some must come from just how put together it sounds. for an individual dnb work, I've yet to hear one that is so realized. Mind you I've heard individual works by others (no comparison) johnny l and the like. But even in the realm of dark dnb, no one has created their own world of sound fully formed, NO ONE. Hearing something like this reinforces how I think goldie is overrated and even though timeless has some moments here and there, given a moment like this, I don't think he could of come up with something so well crafted. I tip my hat to you mr. bukem, you truly are an artist in a genre of faceless creators."
2,"Once again, LTJ Bukem has come through with a wonderful set of songs for Journey Inwards. Granted, the album could've been 1 CD (If we cleaved ""Our World, and maybe ""Point of View""), but it's absolutely fantastic. Smooth Drum'n'Bass meets a modern jazz-type sound.Highlights include ""Watercolours"", ""Viewpoint"", ""Undress Your Mind"", ""Inner Guidance"", and ""Close to the Source"". Amazing!"
2,"Make no mistake on this album, it is nothing short of a master peice. Heavy on the Jazz elements, this CD is pure jazz fusion and organic drum and bass, and theres nothing better. Disc one features more of an electronic basis, while disc two hits hard on the jazz, which ultimately creates the perfect two disc balance of two killer genres. Deffinately worth picking up."
2,"I haven't used all the features yet, but it seems to open almost any Windows<TM> doc file. The only problem I have is that it won't install on my TiBook and it won't register with Microsoft.I'm using Word 2001 on my TiBook."
2,"Just got this product. It works quite well and the adjustments were quite easy to make. The sprinkler does exactlty what it claims it will do, which is perfect for me since I have a strangely shaped front yard space to water.Before I bought this product I read the negative reviews, so I'll add my comments to those. Some people said the sprinkler would move around and they had to weight it down but I have had no such issues. Others said that when exposed to prolonged bright sun the plastic became brittle and the ring eventually broke. Obviously I haven't had the sprinkler long enough to evaluate that one, and, actually, based on that review I am moving my sprinkler to a shady, covered area after use to try to avoid such an issue. I haven't tried to use it in a series, but I may order another one and see how that works out and add to this review at a later time.Thusfar I am very satisfied with the sprinkler."
2,"Billy Marquis is full of soul and rythym. This CD sings to your heart. I caught his show a couple of weeks ago, I could feel it in my bones. I finally purchased another CD to keep in both vehicles. My husband and I would fight over who was gonna get to listen to it everday. If you like good Southern Blues, I highly recommend this CD. This guy is definately going to make it big."
2,"This book is fantastic! It's unlike any other I've read. I reccomend it to any one that likes Sci-Fi, fantasy, action, romance, or just wants a good book."
2,"I never thought I would say this, but this book is better than Ender's Game. Once I passed the Chapter 4 mark I could not put the damned book down!"
2,"You cannot go wrong with a Britax Marathon unless it doesn't fit in your car for some reason. My daughter still happily sits in her Marathon at 5 and a half, and still fits in it beautifully. The people who complain about the buckles being close to the baby, well, if the buckles aren't fitting close to their body, you need to have a certified child passenger safety technician look at how you're buckling your child to figure out what you're doing wrong. Parenting experience or experience selling car seats at BRU does not a car seat expert make. Please, parents, talk only to CPSTs about your car seat concerns. They are the only ones who are trained to give you the proper advice. As for older kids being mad about sitting in a ""baby"" car seat, who is the parent? My daughter sits in hers, and doesn't know any other option, because I tell her it's the safest place for her. End of story.- CPST and happy Marathon owner"
2,"Morris' exegetical work is phenomenal! He paints vivid pictures of not only the Thessalonians themselves, but also the extent of Paul's thoughts and devotion toward these young and dynamic believers. This commentary proved not only useful and thought provoking, but accessible and lucid. Every serious student of the scriptures must attain a copy. Morris has once again hit a grand-slam."
2,"The other day, I bought two CDs for my 1 year old. The first was by the Wiggles. The second one was this CD (Folk Playground). Thank goodness I bought the second one. Now I can play accessible and fun music for my daughter and stay sane at the same time! The lyrics are playful and witty, with some artists adding some twists to some old favorites (Victor Johnson - ""This Old Man"", Laurie Berkner - ""Froggie Went a-Courtin'""). The music is mature, pleasant, and of course, folksy. The Zoe Lewis tune, ""Sheep"" is worthy of special mention...a pure delight. But there's not a single clunker on this CD...for the kids or the parents. Are there any more like this out there?"
2,"High quality productions, accomplished artists, fun songs! My grandchildren and I are thoroughly enjoying this CD."
2,"Let me just add my voice: Springsteen has done it again with a fantastic new album. This is his best work in a while. If you liked ""Nebraska"" this one is right up your alley.One other thing: go up to the ""Customer's Advice"" and put in your favorite Springsteen album. I'm tired of seeing some guy advertise some CD we've never heard of. Let's take this page back."
2,"Another good album,but unfortunately new invention called Dual Disc Format-sucks.I wasn't able to rip this CD and transfer to my MP3 player.I wasted $15.Be careful with Dual Disc!"
2,"I'm a big Springsteen fan. Favorite album - Tunnel of Love. You'll read reviews that call it a quiet, somber album. That's only upon first impression. I must admit I didn't care for this album upon the first listen. I tucked it away and didn't pick it up for a week. Then I gave it a couple more serious listens and became hooked. While there are no loud, rockin' numbers like on the Rising, there are a number of tunes that quietly groove along very nicely. If you're at all a fan, definitely give the album a few good listening sessions. You'll fall for it!"
2,"Before the music scene took a 180 degree turn in 1992, the rock bands before that time actually had some talent. Great vocalists, blistering guitarists, deafening drummers, and some great melody. TNT was a band that had all of these attributes. This album is a must for any of those who like that talented and exciting music of the 80's which is so lacking today. For the alternative/grunge rockers, stay away! Maybe with the release of Def Leppard's Euphoria album, this style of music will become popular again and TNT will once again give us great music!"
2,"This work is an invaluable historical resource for students of A Course In Miracles. Mr. Wapnick painstakingly details the life of Helen Schucman and the scribing of ACIM. He also provides many valuable examples of personal material between Helen and Jesus. Although difficult reading, it is essential for anyone who wants to know the story of how the Course came to be.

2,"Don't Break the Ice is a classic game that has easily withstood the test of time. When I was a kid, I remember my game had a more basic frame with detachable legs. This newer model has a much more sturdy base with built-in legs. It is a little difficult to snap the plastic ice blocks into place, so small kids may need adult help setting up the game. Once the blocks are in place, the game goes quickly, but kids will often want to play multiple games.The game is designed to have the bear's block in the center of the board. You can also set it up with the bear in different areas to see how that changes the strategy. Knocking pieces out one by one lets kids experiment to see which blocks are actually needed to hold the bear in place the longest. And there's something that is simply fun about tapping the pieces out and waiting for the whole set-up to collapse."
2,I have tried several deodorants as I prefer not to use anti-perspirants. This is the one that has always consistently left me smelling great and is long-lasting. Love it!!
2,"This is an outstanding haggadah. I will use many of the ideas at my seder this year. Adults and children can learn a great deal about Passover by reading the detailed, yet very clear and simple explanations about the traditions, seder items, etc. The author also includes many interesting perspectives on the different parts of the seder."

2,"This book gives us an inside look at the life of Solomon Wickey. It fills in a lot of the blanks as to how he became an herbalist, and why and how he works. I was surprised by how much tragedy he has experienced. I had heard about the lawsuit, but reading about it was enlightening, to say the least. I'm impressed he went back to practicing afterwards.If you like this book, I recommendHe's Not Autistic But...: How We Pulled Our Son From the Mouth of the Abyss. While the title may not sound related, the author describes the healing art of releasing that Solomon uses, and gives more detail and explanation on the codes and how to use them."
2,I don't know why people think movies are all sugar & spice because life isnt...affairs do happen..i loved it!! but this affair had a tragic ending
2,"This book is suspense at it's finest.. Everytime you think you know how the plot is going, you turn the page and your wrong. If you love a fast-paced supense thriller, check out ""Tell No One"", you won't be disappointed.."
2,"This book was picked by a member of the book club I am a part of.We have read another title by Harlan Coben, ""Hold Tight"".I think I liked ""Tell No One"" better! The story moved along with good pace. I read it from start to finish over approximately 3 days. You will be stunned at the end. There are so many possiblities presented for the mystery and so the author keeps the reader interested all the way to the end."
2,I really enjoyed this book. It was recommended to me by my cousin who a while ago started her own book club and this was the book they were reading at the time. It started out really fast and then slowed down and became somewhat predictable.
2,"This is the first book of Harlan Coben's I have come across, which is surprising since I am an avid mystery fan. It seemed to be plodding along predictably for me...Right up to the last two or three chapters. Then it twisted off and I never saw it coming.Looking up more of Mr. Coben's books right now! It was great!"
2,"although slightly similar to The Woods, I still really enjoyed this book......Coben continues to write great stories, I can't wait for the movie."
2,"I loved this book. It was well written, thrilling and exciting. I would highly recommend this book. It is hard to put down though so make sure you have enough time to read straight through."
2,My first book by Harlan Coben and ... Wow! Tell No One had me from page one and I could not put the book down. Great character development and plot twists that will have you squirming. I was unable to guess the ending and I love that about Coben's writing.
2,"Wow....I started reading this book and 24 hours later it was finished. I was fascinated by the whole tale. True love, murder, mystery, action packed.....I say good bye to Patterson and Hello to Coben. Harlan Coben can really write a good book."
2,"Terrific book. I dislike Coben's other efforts, especially the series about Myron the sports agent. But this is a well plotted thriller with likeable characters. Big thumbs up."
2,"This was my first Coben book, and now I am hooked. Tell No One is like a crazy roller coaster with dips and twists and highs and lows. When I started the book I had no idea that it had been made into a movie, but the whole time I was reading it I was thinking 'someone should make this into a movie'. If you enjoy suspenseful, Morgan Freeman/Ashley Judd like stories then read this book."
2,"I picked up this Nikon version of this lens at a local camera store a couple weeks ago for use with a D40. I have to say now that I've used it for a little bit, I have no idea how I took pictures without it. I am definitely an amateur photographer, but the convenience of this lens for the price is fantastic. If you are thinking about upgrading from a kit lens to a 55-200 type lens, don't waste your money. I tried this approach, but soon realized that using the kit 18-55 and a separate 55-200 lens was quite a pain. Neither lens was a lens that I could keep on the camera nearly all the time. There is a slight difference in picture quality between this and the kit Nikon lens, but nothing that is worth $400 for an amateur.All of that being said, the lens is a little big, a little heavy, doesn't focus the fastest, but for the price it cannot be beat. Pick it up today, you'll never know how you lived with out it."
2,"Well, this is German tech-house. What else can I say???Ohh,check out ""In Between"" by Martin Landsky, as well as, ... the very well kept secret of ""Groove Factory"". Enjoy!"
2,"Lucinda Williams is a great find. This is all acoustic 12 string blues. There are three great Robert Johnson covers Ramblin on my mind, Malted Milk Blues, and Stop Breakin Down. The recording is all blues covers except Disgusted which sounds like a blues cover. Unlike most cover alblums this has a great oringal sound. BECAUSE LUCINDA WILLIAMS HAS A GREAT VOICE AND CAN PLAY GUITAR LIKE NOBODYS BUSINESS. I also like her record LUCINDA WILLIAMS."
2,"David Memet is one of the best writers of today. His movies are aften thought provocking (The Spanish Prisoner) and sometimes their just plan good (The Untouchables).His new movie, Heist, takes every great asspect from all his movies and rolls them into a great and sharp looking ball of yarn.Heist is set up like so:Gene Hackman plays cool-fire Joe, Delroy Lindo portrays his longtime sidekick and Danny DeVito plays the manipulative fence who saddles Joe with one last, difficult job in this ensemble-driven caper centered on an elaborate, split-second snatching of gold ingots by Joe and his crew.And that's all I'm going to say about the story because the less you know the more apprictive you'll be watching the plot unfold.Now for the bad part, the only thing that [stinks] about this movie is the bare bones DVD it comes on."
2,"David Mamet is a winner scriptwriter He has always those hidden aces bellow the sleeve to surprise us with his enigmatic twists and turns.In this opportunity, two hard to die and smart thieves will confront themselves in the elusive sands of the smartness and perspicacious. Each one is looking for something and this intriguing cat and mouse clash will lead us to a a puzzle game of double crossing, betrayal and well known of the thriller, but so finely articulated and meticulously well made that will become an increasing tension war between two outlaws.All the cast worked out toweringly. Since its immediate release has deservedly won a cult movie status.Watch it without hesitation."
2,"This book is written by a very young girl named after the nobel winning legendary book gitanjali by ravindranath tagore. She wrote this entire poetry on her death bed and all the poems were discovered only after her untimely death at the age of 18. Though young and inexperienced, these poems show a high degree of maturity and poetic mastery. Read this collection and you will agree with me that fate had taken away a great poet and more than that a great soul too early from our midst."
2,hiI used it since first moment (5 minutes every day if I can) cause' my puppy has a problem with fleas and ticks ( I live in Florida where this little things are by dozen) and I don't want to try chemicals on himusually I used to find a couple fleas but after used for 20 days I didn't find anything none zero ticks or evenfleas I am so happy for that and of course my doggy is too!!!HolaCompre este cepillo porque mi cachorro tenia pulgitas y garrapatas no era una cantidad mayor pero me preocupaba una infestasionvivo en una zona tropical donde abundan y no queria tampoco tratar de usar el tipico mata pulgas por los quimicos que sonmuy fuertes asi que use el cepillo desde el primer momento y despues de 20 dias de uso baÃ±e a mi perrito y no encontre nada de pulgas fue genialLO RECOMIENDO PERO HAY QUE SER CONSTANTE
2,"Purchased this for my father-in-law and he says they allows him to see under very well under water.The quality is excellent. Amazon shipping was just amazing very ,very fast and trackable."
2,"I wished there was more early footage of the hep cat himself when he was in his early prime as head of Atlantic. Mostly, this relies on late life footage that is still extremely interesting, such as when Ahmet and Ray Charles sit at the piano and reminisce, or with Robert Plant and Mick Jagger. Only late Jerry Wexler is seen here, also, which is too bad because he would have been interesting as a young man, driving the record company to new heights along with Ahmet. I just read a new bio of Ahmet and this makes the perfect supplement. You will need to see this if you know the story of Atlantic Records."
2,"I found this book quite by accident, and I'm glad I did. It reminds me of the Laura Ingalls books I enjoyed so much as a child, only with a rougher edge. I find Mattie to be an inspiraton, as she valiantly chops the heads off of rattlesnakes to save her baby boy. It's not ""great literature"" for whatever that means, but its entertaining and engrossing, and isn't that what a book is supposed to be? I can't wait to read more of Sandra Dallas' work."
2,"Sandra Dallas did an excellent job with the subject matter. The book has uplifting circumstances and low areas of concern and sadness. Unfortunately, it does not have a ""happy ending"", but it does have a realistic ending. Life was, after all, not idealistic on the plains of Colorado."
2,"I have found this book to be most useful in determining the exact absorbable carbohydrate count for almost any food. Between this book and the nutritional labels on the packaging, there is almost no food you cannot know about. I recommend it to my weight loss patients and in my own book, ""Low Carbs Made Easy."" I am so glad I had it when I cut way back on carbohydrates myself two years ago. It makes a great kitchen companion. I also have them in my exam rooms. Any questions, please feel free to contact me at drbolster.com/"
2,If your a Matt Dusk fan you won't be disappointed.If you don't know his music try it and you will become a fan.
2,I have been using the foodsaver for years. Their bags are super strong. You can micro them or boil them. Wouldn't use any other.
2,"I purchased this book on Amazon for less than six dollars. With the bargain price and Everett's sub-par books I'd previously read I wasn't expecting much. Surprised I was indeed! This is one of the best reads on exercise ever! From start to finish I was captivated by Everett's thorough understanding of the body and more so his ability to communicate it. From the bio-motor ability pyramid to the global muscular system, Everett breaks it down. I would've enjoyed some enlightening concepts on program design that were compatible with the exercise templates but that goes beyond the scope of this book. This is the new Supertraining! Buy this one today."
2,"I can only repeat what most other reviewers said: it's an extraordinary book, a real treasure. On a scale of 1 to 5 stars, this book would deserve 6 -- but I must draw one star for the bulky design ;)Information density is high and actually the book could be a small pocket book ideal to take along everywhere. But unfortunately the publishers preferred to use big typefaces, thick paper and include a lot of empty space. They probably blowed up the book to make it heavier and look ""more important"" in order to sell it for a higher price. For me, they didn't hit the target because I didn't buy the thing. I swear I would spend $40 rightaway if it would be as handy as it could but for now I stick to the electronic version."
2,"For the last year in two different companies I have been evangelizing many of the concepts in ""Pragmatic Programmer"", but had a hard time validating my thoughts to the more skeptical people in our group.That's over now. ""Pragmatic Programmer"" has given me not only the ammunition I need to wage war against some of the more Philistine ideas that I must deal with, it has added to my thoughts and made me a better leader, better communicator and a much, much better developer. Any book that tells you to step away from the keyboard before you begin is good, but this book is a masterpiece because it tells you WHY you should take a step back.Every chapter is a gem and stands alone, but taken together with the references and extremely well-written explanations, it almosts reads like a novel. I felt guilty putting it down!If you are serious about software, serious about becoming a real craftsman and a leader in your field, then this book needs to be on your shelf, dog-eared and used."
2,This is the most inspirational book I have read in a long time!! Recommended for all ages
2,Phones are small. Have clear sound with handset and handset speakerphone. A good buy.
2,"After buying a vacation home, I needed to fix the shower-head in the master bath. The existing one used the pin/pole system, and all I could find in the home improvement centers were complete replacement kits. I needed only the head to replace the original owner's Alson which was full of lime accretion that could not be removed. The new Delta head is perfect, and increased the pressure of the shower (the whole house is set to a lower pressure). It was easy to install with no tools required. My only complaint is that the new button (which slows the flow of water to a trickle) is much more sensitive than the old one was. Otherwise I would have given this item five stars."
2,"The book is a quick read - but that doesn't take away from some of it's powerful messages. Although i didn't treat every piece of advice as gospel (Take on research projects, Always try to become president of clubs) it does have a few pieces of advice that I will keep in mind throughout my college career, such as ""Start fast and end slow"". Overall, I think this book is a worthwhile read (why not, it's only 200 pages or so) but should definitely be a book that only adds to your collection of college strategy books and not be viewed as a collegial Rosetta Stone."
2,"Quite satisfied with this stool. Very sturdy and smooth movement, both up-and-down and rotating. The backrest is much needed by me and for the price I don't thing you will find anything similar. Assembly instructions were bad. I went mostly by the pictures on the box. Sort out the four Allen-head (hex) screws used in the top of the stool - all the rest of them are Phillips screwdriver heads for the two foot rings. The nuts are all the same and surprisingly are nylon locknuts. This stool should provide years of service."
2,perfect size for all of the baby socks and hats and other tiny items to keep them from getting lost in the washer/dryer.
2,"At one time, about a year ago, I tried to read ODD THOMAS and couldn't force myself past the first chapter. What compelled me to give the sequel a shot- I don't know, but I'm glad I did. This is a fun, humble, and exciting book. I really like the main carachter, Odd Thomas. Now, I've read some reviews on here where people trash this book. While they might have found faults in it, I think overall its worth whatever $7 or so price you're going to pay. People who write these 20 paragraph rebukes of this book.... well, I think it's a bit overboard. This book is by far no stinker. I read a lot of books (mainstream, literary, poetry, etc) and I really enjoyed this and will read the third book (Though I'm still skeptical about the first)."
2,It was decent. It was something along the lines of Stephen King but a little different. I bought the next novel in line so here's to looking for more hours of reading pleasure.
2,"Odd is one of those characters that you think about, long after the reading is through. This novel has everything you could possibly want in a story: an endearing main character, solid writing, well-crafted plot --- all twisted together as only Koontz can do (with the help of Oddie of course.) If you have never read Koontz (Odd Thomas was my first Koontz book) then I highly recommend that you start. And if you, like so many of us, are fans of this author, then this book will be among your favorites, forever."
2,"This book was great. I loved it. I'm not sure exactly why so many people found it disappointing.The main noticeable difference that people seem to be concerned with is that there is far less dialogue, and most of the story Odd's narrative and about the descriptions and thoughts that Odd has, but this is due to the fact that for most of the book he is without company, so I found that understandable to a degree.Other than that, I felt that it was a great follow-up, and can't wait to read more in this series."
2,"Percy is right on in this book - all before the modern health clubs took off. He walks the walk. It would be great if it could come back out for general circulation. Percy was the trainer of, I believe, Herb Elliott who held the world's 1500 meter record during the 50's - 60's, and this is a great guide one's maintaining a healthy body, mind, and spirit as one ages - running, general exercises, weight training, and diet. Percy himself was a living example of the common sensical advice, routines, and admonitions - strongly given as the title indicates - contained in the book. Percy is described as irascible and a health food nut. Google Herb Elliott to learn more. As an athletic trainer, the word ""fail"" was unknown to Percy."
2,"I saw Sara Harmer, this band's lead singer, solo at the 2001 Folk Music Festival in Winnipeg. The event boasted an ""all Canadian"" opening night. Sara and The Cowboy Junkies stole the evening. I ordered this album without realizing that the band and Sara solo are two distinct sounds. The first go round, I was a little miffed that Weeping Tile was louder, more alternative and anything but ""folk"". I nearly shelved the disk for good. But I gave the thing another play, vowing to put my pre-conceived ideas on hold. And it worked. I like Weeping Tile... and this collection. Maybe not in the same way as Sara's solo performance. Of course, what record could ever duplicate the feelings associated with watching a singer craft her art against the backdrop of a cloudless July night on the Manitoba prairie, a full moon rising behind her and 10,000 adoring fans clustered before the stage?"
2,"Habanita smells along the lines of vintage Chantilly to me, although Habanita is more complex and much finer. Chantilly is spicier & more feminine, and Habanita is oilier & more masculine. The vanilla in Habanita keeps it from becoming your dad's aftershave. However, both Habanita & Chantilly are powdery leathers that are difficult for me to categorize as floral. Of the two, I think most people would find Chantilly easier to wear. Since Habanita was first, I'll assume that Chantilly was inspired by Habanita, rather than copied Habanita. ;)I love Chantilly, but Habanita is Gorgeous. Drop. Dead. Gorgeous. I only wish Habanita would last longer on my skin. It's very imbalanced, and it almost becomes shy on me. Look at the bottle - Habanita is no wallflower. It must be my skin or my nose."
2,For anyone with a mountain heritage this book is it. Years ago so hard to find . I have given many many copies . Thank you AmazonKeith HagerWoodbridge Va
2,It is about time someone like Dr. Phil McGraw spoke up about the SAD state of discipline and communication in today's families. We really need to take a hard look at how we want to change this sorry state. And Dr. phil is apparently just such a person to help us. In this book he gives practical and easy to use advice on how to help yourself. Can we just be honest and accept that we all need a little help now and again. THANK YOU Dr. Phil!!!!!!
2,"This book outlines a sane approach to family responsibility's. It's well written, humane, and an invaluable source of counsel."
2,"I just can't talk to my teenager! I just can't seem to get through to her. Is this the mother/daughter angst that we all go through, or can this situation be workable? Dr. Phil seems to think I communicate with my teenager without all the tears and fighting. I never thought about how I might sound to her-condescending, like I don't trust her judgment, and like I'm talking down to her. I want her to feel independent, like she is the one making all the right decisions instead of me mandating all the time. I'm trying to follow this chapter word for word and we had a long talk last night and I think we actually heard each other. I recommend this manual to everyone with kids of all ages, but it works wonders for older children."
2,"After I fell in love with 2004's Funeral, I snagged this album as soon as it was released. Initially I was bored and very disappointed, so I ignored it for awhile. Eventually I picked it up again, gave it another chance, and now it's one of my favorite albums; I guess it's an acquired taste? I believe Antichrist Television Blues, in particular, is about Jessica Simpson's father, although it could apply to many others in this age. Other good tracks: Neon Bible, The Well and the Lighthouse."
2,"The Arcade Fire are a highly remarkable band, with a lot of magic surrounding their aura. I have enjoyed this band from their self-titled EP, and have continued to enjoy everything about their interesting sound. Neon Bible is nothing short of epic, and the band proves that their critically acclaimed ""Funeral"" was just the beginning.All of the songs have a very in-depth meaning, have it be about falling bombs, priests/churches, or self-depreciation. The gorgeous ""Intervention"" is splendid, with it's pipe organ and plush vocals. The band, with an astounding seven members, works together like a well-oiled machine. ""The Well & The Lighthouse, one of my favorites, is a song that is bound to be made historic.Arcade Fire is a historic artist, and is bound to captivate the shallowist of listeners with it's sublime music making. I recommend getting this album, and cherishing every last song on it, because this album is definitely the best of 2007."
2,"I have tried to read the bible straight thru and never suceeded--life came at me in many directions. After 3 years of trying, i gave up and bought the bible for dummies. This book helped me UNDERSTAND the bible, not only read the words, both equally important in my opinion. Once i started reading this book, time opened up for me and i read it in a matter of 2 weeks! I couldn't put it down--the more i learned, the more i wanted to know and keep learning. I intend to reread it because for the first time in the 4 years i have been a christian, i truly understand the religion. I would recommend this book for everybody no matter where you are in your spiritual journey. Good luck and God Bless"
2,Excellent for supporting your bible study. This book provides different views and understanding. This book should not be used as your primary guide for bible study.
2,"It works great, I just wish the top was clear so when my neighbors came to see if it was working they could see food had been used. Instead they just left cat more food! I have now used it twice when leaving for a business trip, used with wet food for an old cat. When I came home it was empty. The onl other challenge is that you have to start the timer the day you leave at the time you want it to feed. You can only pick from 6, 12, 24 hours.So I turned it on 24 when I fed cat at 6am..."
2,"I bought this product to feed a cat while away and so far have not had any problems with the unit. Runs on a 9 volt battery and has freezable ice packs in the bottom for keeping wet food cold but haven't tried that yet. The only slight problem is getting the central core unit aligned once it is reinserted after filling the food tray. If it is not inserted all the way down, the central core will spin vs the tray opening. Has an advance button to check the functioning before using. Otherwise, very happy with the product."
2,"Works great once you get through two issues: the first is the poor insructions. You are required to remove the ""cover"" to put in the battery, but there is no diagram showing where to pry this thing apart. As you can see from the image, there is a rotating white section and a dark bottom section (that has a seam). Where in heck do you pry this beast apart, knowing you can break it if you choose wrong? In the end, I was lucky enough to choose correctly (the seam at the bottom). And the timer in the center needs to be forced out, too, because that's where the battery goes! I half expected to have this thing broken before first use.Second, the timer begins from the time you turn it on, and rotates 6,12, or 24 hours later. So turn it on at the right time. I filled the appropriate sections and then left an empty one; fed kitty using the empty section and turned it on at her normal feeding time.Works great once these things are considered."
2,"I bought this recently when cat sitting to keep them fed overnight and in the morning. At first, the 2 adult cats were a bit hesitant to eat from it but shortly after, I could tell they were not starving. The timer makes it turn at the indicated intervals and is very simple to use. The only problem is that the clear plastic cover was cracked when I got it, but it still works just fine."
2,"""Making Change Stick"" is an excellent resource for leaders at all levels of the organization. All of us who have worked to make changes in our organizations know how difficult this process can be. Often leadership implements either the ""task"" methodology or the ""maintenance"" methodology in creating change and then wonders why the change efforts fail. In fact, Mr. Reale recognizes that it is essential for leaders to honor both the task and maintenance roles in order to create the impetus for change. His 12 principles encompass the newest scientific prinicples that corporate leaders need to understand and practice. I heartily recommend this excellent book, both because of its readability and its applicability. You must read this book!"

2,"If your iPod has a protective cover (e.g. skin, casing, etc.), then the iPod will not fit in the holder of this kit. Otherwise, you can fit a bare (uncovered) iPod on it well.* The kit fits well inside vehicle cup holders of various sizes, including adjustable cupholders.* The holder swivels, so you can have your iPod facing straight up or at various angles.* The opening at the bottom of the holder is convenient for plugging a charger into the iPod.* The holder uses a suction cup to firmly grasp the iPod. It actually holds the iPod well."
2,"Flashing on the Sixties is a colorful video which brings back the fun and idealism of a magical time. Lisa Law does an excellent job of communicating the faces and the feelings behind the counterculture. The music and the words of the past help those who did not experience it have a taste of what life was like for many of us in the sixties. For those of us who have been there, this video makes it hard to grow up and move on."
2,"I like the feel and look of the razor a lot--it's heavy, shiny, and the texturing on the handle looks and feels good. The handle isn't too short for my rather average-sized hands.I just used this razor to remove 3 weeks of beard--took me 1/2 hour or so. Having done the same exercise with gilette swivel-head razors, my face feels better after the Merkur (though the shave isn't as close--I'm inexperienced).The razor didn't do as well as I had hoped regarding clogging--it still clogged when confronted with a beard. However, since there is a lot more room underneath the blade compared to common N-blade razors, I believe it can definitely cut more hair before it clogs.I was surprised to learn that when shaving off a beard, I had to push harder than expected--plenty of advice floating around the internet says, ""Use no pressure, just let the razor's weight do the work."" However, that doesn't work when attacking a beard."
2,"My wife cannot breast feed for physical reasons. Nevertheless, our baby girl is thriving on Enfamil Lipil. While we are supplementing the formula with pumped breast milk, I feel much better knowing that we are giving her the very closest thing possible to breast milk with this product.As far as value goes, (...)since we found that our daughter didn't respond well to Similac, it is a pleasure to get this quality product at such a reduced price -- and delivered straight to our door (...)."
2,"We went to see Tanglefoot in Bath, Maine at the Chocolate Church. They were apologetic because they were all sick with colds and flu (my husband could sympathize, he had a cold too) but they were great. Beautiful, meaningful lyrics, great harmonies. A high energy band, even if they were all sick. We'd go see them again in a minute. Bought Full Throated Abandon during intermission and are trying to find the others. Definitely worth the money and more. They sang almost all the songs on this CD and listening to it at home brings back the memory of a great concert."
2,"I have used far too many products on my face trying to control what blemishes do arise. I have started to trust Neutrogenas products more as of late due simply to reviews from others.First, this is far better for your face than the other scrubs that might use walnut shell and the like. The microbeads in this product will be far kinder to your face in the long run. Second, this does have a hydroxy compound in it; this is often recommended by dermatologists in place of using salycylic acid products.This product does not burn and I use it almost daily in the morning. I recommend it highly."
2,"Let me begin by saying that I wasn't the biggest fan of Chopper Ops, which I thought was a poor third to Wingman and the Colonel Ryder Long mini-series. But, Shuttle Down is fantastic! The story is plausible and the chick-count is manageable.The plot has a secret space shuttle program going awry after terrorist bring down a vehicle. But, it's not the shuttle per se that the the Chopper Ops group is after. The twists in the story are many and sharp.Maloney has taken his knack of intertwining characters that began in War Heaven - who was that hot-shot pilot flying the F-16XL? - and taken it to a new level in this, the third of the Chopper Ops series. For those of us in on the gags, it's a riot! For you newbies to Mack/Brian, you'll get the picture real fast.Too bad, so many of these earlier gems are out of print."
2,"Zakk has created a monster on this new cd! You want hard driving music that gets your blood pumped, get this cd. This is heavy stuff, so if you expect the style of his Pride and Glory days, think again. I do not see how anybody can write negative comments about this cd. It is such greatness. There is a not a weak link to this cd. Zakk is an amazing musician, and puts on a heck of a show in concert! Let us pray to the man upstairs for blessing us with the greatness of Zakk Wylde and BLS!"
2,"I loved this book and found it immensely readable. The writing carried you along without you wanting to stop. I have met many Asian immigrants and read many Asian immigrants books, but this is the most stark and informative in it's revelations of what it can be like for such children and their families encountering a different and sometimes unwelcoming USA culture. I do hope this author continues to write as she is a superb and unforgettable storyteller."
2,"Elaine's story is so honest and so well written it becomes almost universal---although she definately describes a certain place, time and situation very clearly. Anyone who has felt what it was like to go to a school where you didn't feel you fit in, didn't feel you had the right clothes or a home you could bring friend home to, or the parents with the right job, can find comfort here, in knowing that someday like Elaine, you will find a place you do fit in. I really loved this book."
2,"This incredibly detailed work will leave the reader with a thorough knowledge of human behaviour. No longer will the reader wonder ""what makes people act like that?"" Contained herein is a COMPLETE and factual text on Human behaviour. You'll be convinced that there are no mysteries about how people act. Knowing this data will put you in control of any areas of your life that include other People"
2,"This is by far one of the greatest cd's I have ever owned. His lyrics are incredible. Not just because they're pleasing to the ear, but because they show his depth as an individual. The various melodies in each song are very unique as well. This is definetly not my typical genre of music, but I gave it a chance. I can honestly say I'm glad I did."
2,"jack johnson is one of the most pleasant surprises of 2001. i picked up the album after finding out he was opening for ben harper on ben's latest tour. i was completely set back by the sound johnson brought. this is a great album, but was makes him even better is his live show. he pours his heart into his performances. get the album then see him!!"
2,"A sexy collection of acoustic pop and ballads, combined with Jack's sense of irony which he incorporates in his lyrics. Playful lyrics and infectious beats liken beach music. This is one disc which should be kept spinning at your next BBQ, pool party, or evening with a sunset."
2,"Johnson's disc is purely the best cd i've bought in the last few months. Very mellow, masterful, and simple. I would recommend this to anyone that likes the acoustic guitar."
2,"Love this album. After a long day at work, I come home lie on my hammock in my backyard and listen to this album. The songs aren't too deep, they are catchy and Jack Johnson's voice fits well with the guitar melodies.I had never heard of Jack Johnson, I came across this cd by accident, I am really glad that I discovered it.Overall, a fun and fast cd its worth owning.In My Humble Opinion"
2,"This CD is simply great. Jack Johnson is the most accomplished surfer/musician ever. If you like Ben Harper, get this album. Harper even makes an appearance on the album playing the slide guitar. This is a top-notch product."
2,"this is a wonderful CD. In a day where heavy metal rap and punk bands are abundant, it is great to find a simple CD like Brushfire Fairytales. It is a great CD, with the standout songs being Flake and Bubble Toes. Johnson strumming his acoustic guitar is infectious, and you will play these two tracks over and over again. Another wonderful song is losing hope. After hearing him featured on G. Love's album playing Rodeo Clowns, I knew that Brushfire Fairytales would be a great album!"
2,What a fantastic sound! It's bluesy yet upbeat. I guarantee if you buy this album you won't be able to stop listening.
2,I had been looking for this pillow forever...I would recomend everyone to try sleeping on this pillow. It has great support and is easy to take with you wherever you travel. It is a must when I go to the hospital. Once you use buckwheat you will never go back to a reg pillow.
2,"When I first heard this album, I was in the world and trying to build a diverse music collection. What was built instead was my love for Christ and the way that Commissioned delivered the message. This upbeat and solemn praise to God gave me something to bop to, to meditate on, and to accept Jesus into my life. I'm so glad I was listening."
2,"At the beginning a boy named Nat came to Plum Field. Soon he settled down at the school there. There he met Tommy, John, and Daisy. He and the other boys go through tempers, lies, and dangerous tea party's.By Danielle Rene Larson"
2,"I picked this book up new in the AMES depart store's rather anemic paperback section back when I was about 13. I read it that night, and again within a week. This book talks to a teen boy's heart that seeks adventure, I think. It's much like Heinlein's novels aimed at young adults that are still a good read after so long, and I think a good comparison. Is it high literature? No, I think not. What it is light, quick, and fun. JMR has gone on to write many more and more polished books since this early effort of his, but by no means should this little gem be ignored. Pick up a battered copy and delve in, it has that Heinlein feel, with the author's own very human twists. I had always wished there were many more of this 'universe', there is one, but many would have been my choice."
2,"I had the pleasure of meeting Mike Kadela at a spoken word night in Chicago. He was the ""feature"" for the night and lived up to the name beautifully. The incredible wordplay found in his book is only further enhanced by his impassioned performance.He chooses to write his poems in a style that few modern poets have the courage to attempt. With this solid foundation he creates lyrical gems that both delight and provoke. I cannot recommend this poet enough. He's fantastic on the page and powerful in person."
2,"nunca un aterrizaje forzoso puede ser tan armonioso, calido y sugerente como este disco de los dead....venian volando alto, nubes rosas, naranjas y amarillas, con cielos purpuras y estrellas fosforescentes...y caer tan bajo..sobre este suelo..real, simple, seguro, nuestro....que habran tomado??? nada puede ser tan puro, matinal y despojado como esta obra maestra!! (ahora repito: que estaban tomando???)"
2,"I'm really enjoying this crock pot. What an easy way to cook! It's a beautiful design, different from typical crock pot look, but it is larger than it looked in photo on screen, but that's not bad, it holds plenty of food that way. Easy to clean, plastic storage lid very useful, can't wait to be able to take it to a pot luck. The programmable function could really be improved upon. I wish I could put in the hours I want at the level I want, instead of it automatically choosing high or low based on the time. I have cooked everything on low, and so far it has taken less time than all the recipies have called for, but the food has been delicious."
2,"I'm very pleased. These are exactly as shown in the picture. I was a little afraid the colors would be off. My kids are masters at breaking things that are supposed to be ""unbreakable"" (four boys), but they haven't managed to break any of these yet. Looks like these might actually last a while."
2,"This is a cute, convenient-to -use product that works perfectly. And what a great price!"
2,"The striking textures that flourish in Georgia Anne Muldrow's ""Olesi: Fragments of an Earth"" are reminiscent of a psychotropic dream. The hypnotic yet soulful melodies take the listener on a journey that is beyond this world. Her sung vocals are like jagged edges compared to the bouncy, sometimes smooth yet somewhat askew beats. Don't think Mary J. Blige or Rhianna or Keisha Cole. Georgia Anne is in a league of her own. A self-produced masterpiece set to awaken the sleepy music lover bored with Ms. McSinger and her over-hyped yet negligible talents. Do yourself a favor and take a vacation to the future of music through Olesi: Fragments of an Earth."
2,"To the last reviewer:You complained about incorrect information from Amazon regarding this phone. Never in Amazon's description do they mention that THIS phone has ""talking caller ID"". The phone with talking caller ID is the:Panasonic KX-TG2357B 2.4 GHz DSS Cordless Phone with Dual Handsets, Answering System, and Talking Caller ID (Black). It sells for $110.19 (at the time of this review).Please do your research and not give a GOOD phone a bad review when your reviewing the WRONG item.THIS phone is great... and I really have enjoyed using it. It's not as fancy as some others out there, but it does the job!!"
2,Chairs were as described. They went together quickly (we ordered 2 sets of 2) and they suit our light use purposes. One arrived broken but was replaced by vendor.
2,How can you say no to a company that has been in this business for eons and knows how to build flow conscious filters for high performance. Not only that you are saving the environment with these long use bad boys. I am a K&N fan.
2,"Great box set, enjoyed watching it, we'll worth it. Would recommend the box set to any fan or casual fan."
2,"As an average piano talent, lessons for 5 years, and then career and children, I found this book to be perfect for me. I really am enjoying the challenge of playing all 100 Classics as provided in this book. The music is wonderful and has easier fingering than the maestros wrote. Marilyn in Las Vegas"
2,"Great book. Articulate, broad, yet concise. Wish it were longer. Would love to have more depth. Using this as a textbook for Graphic Design 1."
2,"A great book, for the right person. For someone wanting to know about typography, or someone just getting started in the field of typography or graphic design, this book is for you. It covers a broad spectrum of subjects, all very relevant to today's world of design.However, it is sorely lacking in content for anyone who wants to get serious about design. It is a primer, an introduction, but in no way fulfilling of its hype. The Grid section is especially vague and almost uninformative. For worthwhile instruction and something to dwell in, I strongly recommendThe Elements of Typographic StyleIt covers the same subjects as this book, going far more in-depth with practical instruction and advice covering every aspect of typography."
2,"This is a great book for anyone studying graphic design and typography. It takes you from the history of print to today's newest fonts. It makes everything clear, and it has lots of visuals to clarify its points. This book is definitely staying in my collection. I would recommend it to anyone interested in design."
2,"The real reason why I wanted this film has everything to do with the ending. I know that seems weird but as a native New Yorker, I just love the scenes between a mom and her son in front of the most spectacular Christmas Tree in the world. So, there it is.The movie isn't particularly bad or good. Pretty much the same formula as the first movie with just a few more predictable changes. But I don't mind sitting through it and going along for the ride. I could do far worse."
2,It still needs a little work but I admire the creativity of the little boy and his braveness. I thought I would never catch my breath from laughing after the little boy kept throwing the bricks from the roof. That was the best part of the movie and when he screamed real loud outside the toy store when he realized who was fixing to kidnap him.
2,"I have become a big Santiago fan ever since I read ""When I was Puerto Rican"" as one of my summer readings. ""Almost a Woman"" is a wonderful work of art. It is easy to undersand and easy to read. In one hour I read two chapters and in one week I finished the whole book, even though I had a lot of homework to do. I was totally hooked. I wish Esmeralda luck. She has become my first and only favorite author."
2,"Anyone can truly teach themselves how to play the piano with this children's collection of familiar Christmas songs. My husband bought me a keyboard as a graduation gift when I got my Master's degree. He said it was to fill all my free time now that I won't be studying, reading, or writing. Well, this Christmas I played three songs for my family on Christmas Eve. It was so heart-warming. It was a memorable experience for my husband and son as well. This book presents songs that are playable by the novice adult piano player. Thanks for giving us a new Christmas tradition."
2,"I bought this book and got it autographed a few weeks ago in Charleston, West Virginia. I didn't expect this author to come up with anything nearly as good as Rocket Boys, but he has. He really has. I can't wait for the next one. A fellow West Virginian."
2,"I first saw this book when visiting my sister in California; she had been given it by a longtime friend. We all grew up together during the 1950's & early 1960's in Leaside where we attended both public & high school. My sister even appears in the book in a circa 1951 classroom picture! There were many familiar sites, which brought back happy memories as well as information about Leaside that I was unaware of. The book is very well done, with wonderful pictures, historical facts & interesting stories. I highly recommend it to anyone who has ever lived in Leaside; it is a real treasure to have! Thanks to Jane Pitfield for putting this wonderful book together. My only regret is that I didn't know about it sooner!"
2,"If there is one thing that Matapat shows in their music, and their live performances, it's that you shouldn't be afraid to express yourself in music and dance! This CD will get you off your feet and dancing down the streets. With an excellent combination of vocals, accordion, guitar, and more, Matapat opens the door of intercultural experience. The music is heavily celtic, and amazing to listen to. I would highly recommend this, not only to people merely looking for good music, but also for students who are interested in learning more about QuÃ©bec's culture and music. The songs teach a lot about the romantic culture inherited from the French, as well as some traditional QuÃ©bec stories. Definitely a super selection!"
2,"This is my 3rd My Scene doll, and I'm very happy with her!! She has 3 very cute tees, and a very soft, and fluffy pair of pants!! A face looks like shes looking at something at the left, and she have such great quality hair, it's such a delight to brush it with a comb!! (Not included) she comes with a dog, and 3 tees, and some cardboard magazines. One tee has a butterfly in the center.(This will be the one Barbie is wearing when she comes!!) The other says 'I <3 River', and the other one is sort of tight, and it has alot of scribles in it. her body is very smooth, making it easy to dress, and i love her rockin shoes!! Hope this Helpes!!Barbie Fan"

2,I enjoy W.E.B. Griffin's writing. I enjoy the intrigue and the way he builds characters and storylines.I am wondering if someone 'in the know' can speak to the realism of the special ops side of the stories.As an airline pilot I can attest that the aviation side is good on big picture but less than authentic on the details.Wondering if the same is true for the rest of the story.Thanks.
2,"I have two of Sandra Woodruff's cookbooks, ""Secrets of Fat-Free Cooking"" and the ""Fat-Free Baking"" cookbook, and I absolutely love both of them. I have just ordered the ""Fat-Free Italian"" and the ""Fat-Free Dessert"" cookbooks, and wish she'd write a version for German cooking as well. I especially like it that with each recipe there's a nutritional breakdown of the calories, cholesterol, fat, fiber, protein, and sodium, per serving. This is fantastic for those of us who are trying to eat a healthier diet. Even my husband loves the recipes. The only minor complaint that I have is that she doesn't include the number of CARBOHYDRATES (grams) per serving. Still, all in all, I think that her cookbooks are the BEST ones the market that I've seen."
2,I bought this on cassette in 1991 and have worn out the recording from playing it so much. I haven't been able to find it on CD here in Australia! It is a fantastic projtect!!
2,"This is a fun toy for everyone. Even our babysitters have fun with it. Although there are nicer piano/keyboards out there, this is a good one for the price, plus my son loves that it looks like an alligator. There are so many things you can do with it, and even though it's made of thin plastic, it's pretty durable. Our son is 18 months old and likes to sit and jump on it. It is still intact."
2,"I found this recording in the original LP version in an used books store. This LP was New, and closed, in mint condition. Original from 1978. And wow! Was very very good recorded, and the music is very good performed and beautifuly executed, intimate. I love this recording as much as I can."
2,"I Love this movie! My all time favorite movie! this is a great family movie, educational ! Get ready for your freedom!"
2,"Willie Dixon wrote some of the greatest songs in the blues catalogue. Where he is a more accomplished arranger, composer and bassist his performing abilities aren't bad at all. He's not quite up to the level of Muddy, Wolf or Sonny Boy, musicians who made his tunes famous, but he wasn't far behind either. The band is solid, the production a bit off, but overall a great album. Definately Willie at his best. Highly recommended...Simon"
2,"I really like this album and would recommend it to anyone who care for blues and the older, more historic blues. Thanks."
2,"THE PRODUCT AND SERVICE WAS GREAT. I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED AS I HAD PREVIOUSLY PURCHASED THE FIRST FIVE SEASONS OF 24. WHEN I RECEIVED MY SEASON SIX SERIES, IT WAS IDENTICAL TO THE 5TH SERIES OF 24. I THOUGHT IT HAD JUST BEEN MIS-PACKAGED, SO I RETURNED IT TO AMAZON. I HAVE TO SAY AMAZON HAS THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE AVAILABLE. THEY IMMEDIATELY APOLOGIZED AND PAID THE RETURN SHIPPING AND AGREED TO SEND ME A NEW SERIES, WHICH THEY DID RIGHT AWAY. HOWEVER IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE I RETURNED, SO I FELT BAD ABOUT THAT. I STILL DON'T KNOW WHY IT IS THE SAME AS MY SEASON FIVE SHOWS. MAYBE I WILL HAVE TO WAIT FOR SEASON SEVEN. ANY EXPLANATION?THANK YOU, WILLARD MASSINGALE."
2,"I keep wondering how the writers can hold their audiences year after year, but they do it somehow. This is seriously the best there is on television."
2,"Season 6 of ""24"" is unique and excellent entertainment. The story lines are unpredictable and regardless of other reviewers ratings, this series deserves a 5 star rating. Superb acting. Yes, we all love Jack Bauer!Packaging:* slimline, single-sided disks in polypropylene cases-- just the way that they should be.* 4 episodes per disk, 6 disks with lots of extrasQuality:* one bad unreadable disk (disk 3, episodes 3 and 4), however, amazon supplied a FAST replacement and covered the postage too!Story:* Yes, I would have liked to have known a bit more about what happened in China, however, the writers did an excellent job of pulling things together on this series. Making the story authentic in China would be difficult and probably impossible. I think that all-in-all, this was a really nice way to get on with the CTU actions in the U.S.Timing:* Great ending!!!! Hurry up with Season 7 and roll it out in the summer instead of December!!!!!"
2,"I know.. some stuff were missing on this season, but still Jack Bauer mades the day for all of us....I love 24 and cant wait for the next seasons to come..."
2,"This sequel to PG County was a genuine page turner. Although it could stand on its' own, having read the prequel gave us the history and background we used to relate to the characters' strong feelings and actions. We identified the main theme being conflict, but at the end, the word resolution was in order. Reading the personal growth of each character was a good way to ""close"" the drama in Silver Lake (or so we think). Postive or negative, we thought each character reaped what had been sown; in addition, with all of the emotion emitted throughout the book, we could personally connect to the characters in some way. At the end, we couldn't get enough of Mrs. Bentley and all her neighbors in Silver Lake."
2,"I do like the improvement with my SRI. Coupled with new plugs and wires, made my 97 Civic get up to 40mph with driving out of Chicago in traffic. The pic shown for the product is another edition of the SRI but the correct image of the product with a different color can be seen on other 22-413B's on Amazon.Mounting took a trip to the hardware store to buy some hardware for hanging plumbing because the mounts don't line up exactly. Turns out I was able to mount it in a very close but better location using the same chassis hole but using a homemade bracket that holds the SRI about 1.5-2 inches higher."
2,"In this second novel of Sherlock Holmes's Dr John Watson continues introducing the world to the singular methods of his strange friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes.He starts the book with a study in deduction, looses his temper, and then cools down at Holmes's explanations. Then a singular customer appears in the stage with a strange case. This case leads to a terrific murder with outlandish murderers.As usual, Watson, as dumb as a frog, cannot see a thing that his friend Holmes, as cleaver as a fox, can spot so easily.The story here is a bit slow, especially in the capture of the villains, but it ends in a thrilling manhunt, and then in an unearthly account of the major villain.This novel, in my opinion, is the best Sherlock Holmes's ever written by Doyle. I think any Holmes's fan must read it."
2,"We bought this phone to use with VoIP and a Wireless G network. We have absolutely no complaints. It is as clear as a bell, even from Scotland to the US. The interface is intuitive and the programmable ring tones and light colors based on incoming numbers is a definite boon. You know who's calling before you get up to get the phone.The only item that might change our purchase decision is the ability to now buy a similar phone designed for VoIP directly from Vonage.com. It wouldn't have fit our needs just now, but new VoIP customers should consider it as an option."
2,"Sounds good enough to make you buy Panasonic phones exclusively in the future. Looks good enough to be a high-tech touch for your kitchen, or a perfect match for your A/V gear.Pros: Very good sound quality and feature set. Pleasant standard ringtones. Nice ergonomics, with very clean button feel. Classy looks, with two-tone silver-grey casing and sleek shape.Cons: Only capable of handling two handsets, unless I'm mistaken."
2,"I first read Bernard Waber's The House on East 88th Street as a child and was capitivated by Lyle the Crocodile. How I loved this story about a bright green crocodile living in a bathtub in a New York City brownstone.Though frightened at first, the Primm family is won over by their housemate. Lyle is amazing, he takes out the trash, brings in the milk, (this book was first published in 1962!)helps around the house, and loves a nice, hot bath complete with Turkish caviar! (We could all use a Lyle) The story of Lyle does not end here; Waber went on to write seven more titles about this lovable creature. Out of all the Lyle books, this is his best-known. This charming children's classic is suitable for small children between the ages of four and eight."
2,"Other reviewers mentioned weak snaps to close and a cheaply made plastic case. The item I got is more of a backpack than a case, appears to be well made, has a zipper closure, and is roomy. It is like we received entirely different items, but mine is what is pictured. I am happy with it. It will make a nice gift for the little girl I bought it for."
2,"I'm not sure when these originally came out, but I've been wearing them ever since. Once you find your size, they fit the same every time, and that is a plus. They are made well. I machine wash them with all my other clothes. I do put them into a mesh bag which gives them some protection, but outside of that I'm not doing anything special.I especially like the front closure because it is easier for someone with physical issues to put on. The back is more like a normal bra than most front closure bras. I have asthma and I can't breath with one of those bras with a ""support back"". This is way more comfortable.This is a quality product, and it is made well consistently."
2,"Do to mobility problems I like the front close bra. Most of the stores around here stopped carring this style. I was happy to find them on line, and will be ordering more. Thank you"
2,Fantastic product gives great support and very comfortable to wear i am usually an F and when order got the DDD and it fits perfect will definately be re ordering i got 2 bra's for less than i would usually of paid for one..great product..great price...
2,Have used before. Item came very quickly as ordered. This site is a site I use often. I have no issues with order.
2,"Okay, so it is VERY different from the original PEYTON PLACE, but so was the book! Carol Lynley and Tuesday Weld are gorgeous, adorable and totally enjoyable. Eleanor Parker and Mary Astor are campier than a couple of drag queens. It is kitschy, early 60s soap opera at is best. This should be playing in revival houses as a double bill with the original. Watch for Bob Crane in a cameo role as a talk show sidekick.Enjoyable commentary by film historian, original theatrical trailer and 2 short movie-tone news reels are fun special features, but it's a pity that Lynley wasn't invited to do a track with her own remembrances...she has great anecdotes!Beautifully preserved soap fest, best when viewed as a double feature with the original PEYTON PLACE."
2,"Of course it is admittedly different from the novel due to adaptations made for it to be a cinematic success, as all movie adaptations are. But even if you are crazy about the novel this is THE BEST movie portrayl of Dracula to be found (i know because I own them all) The mood and the talented acting will swallow you into the movie from beginning to end with great special effects to boot. Excellent to watch with your signifcant other and a cornerstone for anyone's collection (horror buff or not)"
2,"I've seen many versions of ""Dracula"", but this by far is the scariest.The music is spine-chilling, the special effects are life-like.Gary Oldman & Anthony Hopkins steal the show.I kind of liked the Vampire-babes too."
2,"Neula and her mother were safe -- for the moment. Neula's stepfather would never seek his runaway wife at her childhood home, now the property of the notorious Marquis of Kerne, dubbed ""the Pied Piper"" for the conquests that were the scandal of the court... But, in the breathless space of a heartbeat, Nuela's sanctuary became an island of love -- and danger, as the Marquis faced the implacable vengeance of a murderous Russian prince..."
2,"wonderful cd, got here very quickly and in great shape, would definitely buy from this person again"
2,"My 4 year old daughter absolutely loves this toy. She can do this all by herself (""growing"" and ""styling"" her hair).The only drawback is that sometimes the Playdoh can be hard to get out of the pony when it's time for clean up."
2,"Goodbye, Children (Au revoir, les enfants) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.4 Import - Australia]A great movie. Moving film about friendship. I can see why it won a gold award in Europe. The acting is excellent, and the movie is well worth buying. If you speak French, it's even more enjoyable. Super movie, and I highly recommended it."
2,"emotionally shattering true-life tale (well, sorta) based on an incident in director louis malles youth wherein the school in which he (played by the very beautiful gaspard vanesse who sadly did not continue acting) was enrolled served as a haven for jewish students hiding out from the nazis. what could have been merely a suspense tale or a coming of age movie (and it IS both, and splendid examples of each) instead resonates as a meditation on survival, betrayal, and accomodating and forgiving oneself. a great film, but only for mature audiences."
2,My kids absolutely love this movie! Just as good as the first one was! Hope they do part three soon!
2,i purchased for the family as we love this movie! we saw it on tv and has so many commercials now we have it direct with no commericials! it is so funny and truly a grand family movie. high recommend for all ages. thank you to the seller for a grand overall experience in all areas. thank you
2,"This is a great classic movie, with plenty of good lessons for kids on sharing, getting along with others, and teamwork. Our granddaughter loves it!"
2,"It works like a charm. Good quality for the price. Hope you get free shipping, though, because this one's heavy!"
2,"I was totally wowed by this movie. I poped in my DVD player and was entertained and inrtigued through out the whole movie. The characters are strong, and the cast that is portraying them is excellent. Natalie Portman is AUSOME in this movie, so is Julia Roberts. The diolouge is snappy and unexpected, and the ending is astounding. This is the type of movie that takes you on a ride, and you have no idea where you will end up. I love the gritty, real life feel of the characters, this is it not glossed over. It looks like they used natrual light when filming, so that it gives it a natrual look to it. The only problem that I had this movie was that some of the language was a bit harsh, but not enough to detract from a five star movie!!"
2,"This is a strongly evocative film. Closer is an adult themed movie with strong language, superb writing and achingly beautiful acting by Jude Law, Clive Owens, Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts.The movie moves seamlessly, touching the beginings and endings of the duplicitous and self-serving relationships that entangle the four main characters. The roots of the movie are the deep scars the characters take into their relationships, using themselves and their partners in very contemporary deceitful, duplicitous and self-rationalized ways. The characters are desperate and deft and truthful and dangerous.A movie that is not for the faint, but is truly rewarding."
2,Where the heck is the soundtrack for this movie? Or at least who sings the song and the end?
2,I found this gem in a pawn shop many years ago and it is still one of my favorites.The music on this CD is some of the best blues you'll ever hear. I don't know why this man isn't famous because he certainly should be.
2,Jane Austen strikes again. A high heel as a murder weapon? The world of Beverly Hills is a far cry from other places when it comes to fashion.
2,I would recommend Laura Levine to anyone who like cozy mysteries. They are hilarious and a wonderful ready every time.
2,"I have a lot of pets and have tried many different litters, I always go back to Arm & Hammer. I think a lot of people think a good litter should mean that you don't have to clean the litter box as often, this is never going to happen. With regular scooping, this litter can remain odor free for up to 1 month. After that, I completely empty and bleach the boxes and start fresh. It clumps well and I like that it comes in a recyclable container, cardboard. I usually buy the multi-cat, but I really have not noticed a difference among the types."
2,"I really like this game, but the graphics could have been much, much better. Still, it's worth buying if you're an InuYasha fan."
2,"I first saw Arnold singing backup to James Taylor in concert. James let him sing one of his songs during the concert and we (the whole crowd) were blown away by his range and vocal control. That was about 6 years ago and I was never able to find his CD, until I noticed that he was playing a small club in Hollywood on New Year's this year. I went to see him with a bunch of family and friends, who all beacame instant fans. It was a fantastic show and afterwards I met Arnold; he gave me a copy of ""You Can't Go Back"" that he had burned at home. I loved it and am glad I can now tell people where to find it....Thanks Amazon.com! I especially like the track ""Little Rose,"" which is about a single friend of his who adopted a little girl.Arnold McCuller is a fantastic Artist who deserves a great deal of fame and fortune."
2,"I don't care for much history but I am interested in Hitler was thinking and doing in the time he was in power. I haven't had time to read this yet, but have heard a lot about it. Shipping was great and condition was just like the seller stated. I am not sure what I would do without Amazon at my finger tip!"
2,"This series is the best Third Reich documentary I've ever seen.It concentrates (mostly) on facts, not on political correctness.Therefore it gives you a whole lot of more interesting viewing than the most post-war propaganda ""documents"". Considering the fact that in status quo it is impossible for anyone to publish totally objective knowledge on this matter,it is a helluva achievement."
2,"Simply one of the best films ever, and displays why Howard Hawks is one of the all time masters of the medium."
2,"I saw this movie yesterday and it's good. It did have a little more violence than part 1. I still think part 1 is good. And this movie should actually be rated R. Well, that's the way it felt for me."
2,These cranberries have a wonderful texture and flavor. The will make a great addition to my trail mix and sugar rolls.
2,"I love this book! I'm amazed no one has reviewed it yet! I've had this book since I was a child in the 70's. It has always remained in my mind, the stories of Mother West Wind's Animal Friends."
2,We have been reading the TinTin books to my grandson since he was three (he is now five). He loves them. I do believe we have almost all of them. Amazon's prices on new paperbacks are better than Powell's.
2,"There are books to take to the beach, and there are books to snuggle up with on a cold winter night. I think this Keane/Bombeck effort is a rainy-day book, the kind of day you wonder whether or not you should have sent the kids to school with rain slickers. Oh and make sure you've got a good cup of coffee and a doughnut when you're reading this book. Or maybe wheat toast."
2,"This is my second online purchase of a mat bag, and this on is so superior to the first one for the same price. Sturdy construction, nice fabric. I highly recommend this bag."
2,"Providing possibly more giggles, guffaws, chuckles, and chortles per page than any other important literary creation this century, Catch 22 has the potential to become one of those rare works whose legacy will live one forever. Indeed, Yossarian lives!"
2,"I thought the book was well written and funny at the beginning, but at the end it became a little agravating. His humor used at the end came at the wrong times and kind of made your stomach turn. The book began as a light and funny comedy, but turned a touch revolting. The ending and beginning made up for it though so I gave it a 4 out of 5."
2,"Brilliant, moving, hilarious, profound, tragic, complex, gripping, absurd, clever, joyful, witty, evocative, acute, bitter, ingenious, unique, wise, simple, perceptive, sad, riotous, truthful, sublime, genius.Catch-22. All of these things and more."
2,"A fantastic novel that I read long ago, actually better now that I am a little older. Recounting the misadventures of a flight squadron and its hero/fool Yossarian. Heller makes it clear that everything has a catch, in this tale of damned if you do, damned if you don't. Each character is in a situation that is result of counteracting forces rather than free will. Hard to put down and sad when it finally ends. I highly recommend Catch 22."
2,"That about says it all. I had no idea what to expect when I picked up Heller's masterpiece and perhaps that was part of the wonderful-ness: it was a total surprise. After reading Catch-22, my outlook on life was completely thrown for a loop. No book has ever made me think and reevaluate as this one did. A perfect novel - it makes you laugh, it makes you feel sad, it makes you think and it stays with you. I am ever amazed at the intricacy with which the novel is structured and how the story unfolds. I re-read Catch-22 regularly."
2,Ordered this used book from this seller and the condition of the book exceeded the description. This is a great way to buy Everyman's Library titles if you're looking to cut costs.
2,"What this book lacks in artistry it more than makes up for in energy, and in those great moments of Lewis Carroll logic. Any book that exposes the moral bankruptcy that is warfare in our time as beautifully as this one does deserves classic status. But I sure wish I could throw out all those redundant adverbs Heller uses to describe how his characters talk, he said helpfully."
2,"Joseph Heller's Catch-22, is an unequivocal satire on postmodern American life, with messages of dissident revolt that are well suited to the decade in which they appear. Heller is almost systematic in the issues he touches: the frustration of the individual up against powerful and faceless bureaucracies; the anticommunist purges of the Cold War and its smug hypocrisies; and strong antiwar issues that dominate postmodern America. In Heller's works, escaping these traps and inconsistencies of government is essential in the pursuit of moral and self-preservation. After all, ""The enemy,"" as Yossarian puts it, ""is anybody who's going to get you killed, no matter which side he's on."""
2,"My girlfriend asked me to read it and reluctantly I did. But then I could put it down. Now, I find myself having similar conversations with my friends every day. I must read."
2,"This book is particularly hilrious for anyone who has ever been in the military. I finally read this novel almost a year after getting out of the Army, and could not stop laughing.Some of the characters ring so true it is almost eerie, though funny. Pompous officers who care nothing for their men, but are willing to ""sacrifice"" to win the war, when the only true sacrifice comes from men like Yossarian, who they so readily send into harm's way for their glory - oops! I mean to win the war.There is the war profiteer who sees no wrong in scr**ing his buddies as long as he makes out OK. There are the multitude of characters who, one way or another, are war's hapless victims. This is one of the greatest anti-war novels ever written, because it gets its message across with subtlety and humor.An excellent read and an American clasic."
2,"This book is nothing short of AWESOME ! It's cutting-edge. It's profound. It's hilarious. It's dangerously serious and seriously dangerous. It's earthshaking. It has no comparison. One in millions. An absolute Must-Read, if you know anything about books... It can be a life-changer and an experience worth going through. Do yourself a favour and read it. You'll never forget it. It will change your perception of sanity forever."
2,"As a high schooler, I would recommend ""Catch-22"" to anyone who isn't intimitated by larger books. This book is a novel about war and its prospects, morals, and the effects it has on the people within it. The narrator focuses on the events occuring in the camp of Pianosa, located on an island off the coast of Italy. The main character, Yossarian, gains morals and fights the system during World War II. It is very good a keeps the reader's attention. It's a nice variation from most dull high school reading, and I would rank this book right up there with ""Clockwork Orange"". If you are a high schooler looking for a challenging book, I would most certainly recommend ""Catch-22"". (Didn't that sound like it came straight out of Reading Rainbow?)"
2,"Catch-22- saddening, thought provoking, hope inspiring, and really rather good. no, not everyone dies, even though it starts to appear that way. i dont usually care for war related things that often, but this was worth reading. It takes a humorous and cynical approach the pointlessness of trying to escape war and the headaches it can cause. Catch-22 is the ultimate devil in this book and it consistantly pops up. The story follows one man and his struggles to survive in an insane and hopeless world. Add in a bunch of pilots begging to get home, a doctor who is technically dead, and a mess seargent who uses logic that surpasses everyone else's minds, and you have one motley crew. A book of laughs, tears, puzzlement, and thinking, Catch-22 is a book worth reading."
2,This book is a classic. Catch-22 is on all of those Top 100 books of the century lists. Just start reading the damn thing already! Jesus!
2,"It literally took me YEARS to finish this book. I'd get halfway and be so bored/frustrated I'd put it down and read something else. Fortunately I did manage to finish it, and I realized it really was worth the effort. I'd recommend it to anyone with a solid sense of humor, a taste for the absurd, and a truckload of patience."
2,"Heller's timeless classic, Catch-22, is amazing. Hellercrafts an upside-down, senselessly sensible world whereeveryone but the main character, Yossarian, is sane. Or isYossarian the only sane one? Decide for yourself when youread the book. The novel is endlessly funny, pointedlyrevealing and gleefully rambunctious, filled with inherentcontradiction that somehow makes perfect sense. It's beenone of my personal favorites for years and will remain sofor many to come. Highly recommended."
2,"I read this book this spring, and it is now one of my favorite novels. The language is challenging, but not flashy. The story is rich, full of wit, humor, loss, friendship, hope, and triumph. I recommend this book to everyone."
2,"Catch-22 is one of those rare novels that remain will remain significant long after the time about which it was written passes. The humor is brilliantly crafted, and the characters are both outrageous and believable. But more importantly Joseph Heller explores the nature of human survival, morality, and patriotism in ways that few other authors have even attempted"
2,I would recommend this product. If somebody is planning to use voip these phones are perfect
2,"My oh my..... I love, love, love this set of CDs. I am singing the praises of this music to anyone who will listen. It is playing right now!"
2,"This was the first album the Seasons did that contained all self penned songs (the original albums last track was ""On Broadway Tonight"" which would later turn up on the b'side of ""I've Got You Under My Skin""). The Seasons originally recorded the track ""An Angel Cried"" in the 50's as Hal Miller & the Rays. But this new version contains Frankie's most powerful vocal to date. Every track on this CD is a gem. Featuring 3 great singles ""Rag Doll"" ""Save It For Me"" & ""Ronnie"" and 2 B sides ""Huggin My Pillow"" and ""Funny Face"". It was a pity Bob Gaudio and Bob Crewe didn't create more albums like this for the Seasons, instead of relying on old standards and current trends like Dylan & Bacharach."
2,"Mr.Nanny is a great film for kids,and adults too! Hulk Hogan gives a heart-wrenching performance as Derek Nanny, a man mercilessly teased beacause of his comical surname. He becomes a figure of fun to both children and animals. In the most dramatic and moving scene of the film, Hulk in a moment of self-pity and depression 'clotheslines' a young boy who calls him a ""no-good nanny who has a girl's haircut"". Tragic indeed."
2,"I never thought this would happen, but, new found glory has actually matured. When i bought this cd i was totally surprised. of course, they have the nfg sound still, but, there is more of an original feel to it. If you have been a nfg fan for a long time, or are just checking them out, you need to buy this album. I never expected jordan to sing low, he tries different vocal ranges, its amazing. If you like pop punk, emo, or just strait out rock you will enjoy this cd. the best tracks are: well, never mind i like all of them!"
2,"New Found Glory although still not quite widely known is still in my oipinion the greatest band ever. That may seem like I'm going too far, but that is my honest opinion. And much like every other album they released this one too is awesome! Just sample any one of their songs and chances are if you like that one then you'll like them all. NFG is the only band I've loved every song of because I am so particular and I hope that you'll love them too! Enjoy!"
2,There is only one word that I can use to describe this CD...AMAZING!!! The tracks are fun and great to listen to. This is my all time favorite CD and would recommend it to anyone! I really think NFG recorded a great album!
2,"The new sound is awesome, but in this one they seem to whine to much. The Cd with there best voclas has to be Nothing Gold can Stay. But there self-titled is awesome. This one is kind of a let down, and if New Found Glory if you are reading this, you guys are great, but can sing about girls and something more serious on your next cd. This one sounded like Nsyncs lyrics with punk music. Tracks 1,2,3,4,6,8,9,11,and 12 are the best tracks."
2,"I love this textbook for speaking French because it integrates French history, culture, grammar and vocabulary with lots of pictures and exercises. The online workbook is a fabulous addition as well."
2,"Rod Serling at his best. You can see his imprint all over the story.Now that the series has been released in Letterbox, it can be appreaciated in it's original glory... As it was intended.. I have to say the tribunal scene is one of those scenes that has a far greater impact when seen in letterbox...One of my favorite films.."
2,It is quite a small irony that Charlton Heston (Moses) is the star of this movie. He builds the franchise well as Taylor the self-absorbed commander reduced to animal in a cage. He plays the role well but has plenty of help. Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowall (one of the most underrated actors who have been)and Maurce Evans do their best to steal the show. (Particularly Evans who's proves the screen presence of a great stage actor cuts through any amount of makeup. The passion and interaction of the characters as they argue their cases mirrors the arguements of the times which is one of the movie's strengths. Well shot and quite a spectacle considering the scale of the movie. The franchise that follows never comes to this level and the amount of parody it has spawned doesn't cut it. But this one is a winner. It only remains to see if the remake can match it.
2,"This is a great film, although in some ways a little dated. The chimp protestors and ""Don't trust anyone over 30"" comment comes to mind. Charlton Heston was terrific in this, playing his role just right in my opinion: ""What the Hell would I have to say to an ape?""Even if you don't like scifi this is a fun movie to watch."
2,"In an inspirational and touching telling of the iconoclast Johnson family, Wooten illustrates their struggles in the turmoil of South Africa. In adopting the infected Nkosi, Gail and the Johnson family embark on a taxing and unheard of, yet fulfilling lifestyle.This book not only tells a great story but it encourages the reader to re-examine the important aspects of life. I highly recommend this book."
2,First the service at Amazon is first Class!! The watch repair kit is great. Has all the tools I needed for my many watches that need batteries and cleaning etc. Yes I can recommend.
2,"Here's yet another fantastic album that is almost impossible to find. It's amazing to consider that even back in 1988 when this album was released, Daryl had already been singing for years. But one listen will convince the listener that, oh yes, he's been singing for a while. This kind of artistry comes only with experience.Songs like ""Worthy Is The Lamb"" and ""I'll Be With You"" are what built Daryl Coley's well-deserved reputation for being an anointed song stylist. This album is also blissfully spared from the production excesses that made even some gospel albums from the 80's sound hopelessly dated. I can't say that it sounds brand new. But the work has aged well.Minister Coley was and is a master artist doing what he does best - using the gift of song that the Lord blessed him with. This project is one of his best."
2,"A beautiful piece of jewelry, it will make my daughter very happy on her birthday this Dec. I bought this so early because at this price, it was a steal! I have not come across another bracelet half as nice for the money!I am very pleased and would recommend this product to anyone.M.Hamlyn"
2,"As many people, when I first got the book I marveled at the size and thought upon myself that a book this large is going to take a long time to read. Realistically I've breezed through it rather rapidly and feel very confident facing the DBA certification. Unlike most I did also read the other Certification Exam's part as my primary job role is a developer I plan to attain both Certifications. Both sections were concise and precise, I learned quite a bit that I had thought I already knew enough about. I would highly recommend this book to anybody with at least some solid foundations in SQL and MySQL."
2,"I like the halter but needed several more holes to adjust the fit for a smaller headed horse.Could include extra brads or extra holes or possible a small,medium and large size insted of one size fits all."
2,"I've had two Food Saver brand vacuum food sealers in three years. When my second one went out less than a year after I got it, I decided I needed to find a better brand. I purchased a Black and Decker. Couldn't even get it to seal the bags. So it went back. Finally, I found this Rival. I love it! It seals even better than my Food Saver! I really like how it has the automatic seal button. The food saver only offers this feature on its more expensive models. The cheap price is icing on the cake. I would definitely recommend this! Actually, I'm buying this for two family members for Christmas gifts!"
2,"Has a plot that EVERY mother will know all too well. Mrs. Elephant futilely tries to relax in the bath; this is impossible with her three active kids. Illustrations are colorful and funny, so is the story. Great gift for ages 3-5 years; older siblings will enjoy listening to it as well."
2,"If you are a fan of Plasmic Honey and good mixing, pick this one up. I have yet to see ANY Dj's who rival Ojeda and Parm. They are superb and you will not want to miss this one. For those who frequented CPI's in the Hamptons this summer, you will have heard these classics. Check Ojeda out at CPI's and Limelight in the summer. He is RAW, and unlike mnay dj's he will keep you on the floor, regardless of exhaustion. Ojeda is superb."
2,"This is a very good phone and answering system. I don't get any ""feedback/echo"" like I have on other phones. I like being able to retrieve my messages from the handsets. The phones stand up and I like that not having to always lay them down when not in the charger. The video (see it in action) on this page is not for this phone. I don't think I can add any more handsets to this system though."
2,"This is one of the best nursing diagnosis books on the market. It is easy to use, very understandable, and the layout is extraordinary. I use this book for all of my care plans and to cross reference with other care plan books. This book is every penny worth the cost."
2,This book is very helpful in creating a nursing care plan. This is one of the only books I've found that provides more than one goal (plan). Most of the other books I have only provide one goal!
2,"Este CD y la pelÃ­cula cambiaron mi vida. Es una obra maestra, el clima generado por el director y la viola de Jordi Savall hacen una fiesta para el oÃ­do de todo el que escuche. Es un CD que no hay que dejar de oir ni una pelÃ­cula para dejar de ver."
2,"I thought I was hip, enlightened and beyond being shocked by a movie. I've only felt disturbed by a films brutality a few times in my life ie; A Clockwork Orange, Blue Velvet, and Natural Born Killers. But this, this frightning movie takes the prize. I looked forward to it's arrival, when it finally came I put it into the VCR watched it in a state of shock, took it out of my VCR, put it back on the shelf and have not touched it since. This movie scared me. I'm frightened. That is why Remmi gets four stars. A fictional film that produces the same effect as a documentary about death camps deserves some sort of praise. Someday I will try to watch it again. Buy this film if you think your man enough. Not recomended for psychopaths seeking justification. Bon apetit!"
2,"I watched this film during a weekend in which I also watched City of God and Requiem for a dream, by the time I got to this one I was so drained, that the violence wasn't a big issue. It seems to be a satire of media in the same vein as Natural Born Killers. Or Natural Born Killers is in the same vein as this I suppose I should say.We are faced with the dispicable, yet the shooting makes it almost voyeuristic. I don't think it's only poking fun at the media for observing rather than acting, but pokes fun at us for watching. This is a disturbing movie, that does explore the darker side of human nature."
2,This movie will long be remembered. Finally it is about time for Laurie Strode to get revenge on her brother. Also this movie has the coolest effects of gore out of all horror movies combined. Kind of like when Michael drove the hockey skate into the kids face.
2,I hadn't seen any other Halloween besides 1 and 2 when I saw this and if my review had happened a month ago I would have a different opinion. Laurie Strode acts as if she only had one child. For some of us who have seen the middle ones know that she had a daughter Jamie who died in the 6th film. I feel that there should have been more regard to the middle films instead of a 3 minute insult to Dr. Loomis. And Laurie must be some kind of pyscho to get out of that car to go fight Michael and even then she runs away. If anybody noticed when she told her son and his girlfriend to go to that persons house down the road that was excaltly like when she told the boy and girl she was babysitting to run down the street in the first one. I thought that was kind of cool. Anyway this movie was good and the 5th best in the series
2,"I thought that the film was excellent, stunning and scary!! That person from Brett Bishop Roy, Utah is wrong!!!!! This movie was neat and Jamie Lee Curtis made an Oscar wurthy performance! I own the movie so I have probobly seen it 34 times! Michelle Williams and Josh Harett gave an excellent performance too! I have seen all the Halloween's and I think ""H20"", 2 and 6 were the best!!! If I were incharge if movies, I would vote this ""Best film of the year!"" And that bitch that I mentioned earlier, I thought that all the movies she thought sucked, were good! I give H20 *****!"
2,"I recently bought Halloween H20 and after reading all of the negative reviews, all i have to say is that the blu ray transfer is not the bestest but the picture quality looks very good. Compared to the original widescreen release, the picture looks great even though it is in 1:78. The audio sounds very good also! i dont know why people complained about this blu ray release. over all this release is very good!"
2,"This is the real Halloween 3. The sad thing for the series is Halloween 3. I DID NOT LIKE the fact Michael was not in the movie, still its not a bad film on its own, I DID LIKE H 20, it answered a lot of qestions regarding the family tree, although im still confused if Jamie had a daughter or son. The spooky atmosphere makes these films. My favourite movies are pts 1-5. Pt 1 - 3 brings me back to my youth and the DVD transfers are fine, if you are after something intelligent, this is not for you, for the films are a fun and entertaining session of good-looking horny teens getting slashed. Not great but what the hell its all popcorn stuff anyway. If anyone is interested in Halloween collectables, email taylor5821@hotmail.com"
2,"H20 truly reverted back to the roots of Halloween. The foliage enclosed academy, the dark autumn night. Even Michael looks like he lost a few years. A solid plot and many intricate details that revert back to the original few make H20 a must. Even LL Cool J is good for his role. Busta Rhymes however in Resurection...was not."
2,Wonderful book. Very easy to understand. Sound information. Very helpful hints for raising an ACD. Highly recommended.
2,Everyone knows the windmills might be giants from cartoons and blurbs in high school English Books. But don't be fooled. This is a quite intense tragedy of a man who wants to be a hero in a world that despises heroes.
2,"Cervates after fighting in battles for Spain and then being captured by Algerians, wrote the novel Don Quixote. This book is well planned and the book even though long flows very quickly. This book is for advanced teenagers-adults. You could read this book twenty times and find even more concepts in this book. Quixotism is what is the concept in this book.Don Quixote last name comes from quixotic which means doing without thinking. I recommened this book, don't miss out on Don Quixote."
2,"Since these are so thin, they don't make holes in your work. The other thicker rings make gaps in fine knitting. Be warned, though, since these are so thin and light, they tend to get lost easily so buy extra."
2,"This is REAL hip-hop. None of that MTV bling bling - you're only a baller if you got a Bentley CRAP. I purchased First Born after hearing the genius of their 2004 release - E & A. I respect this duo even more after hearing the diversity between the two albums. It is simply amazing. Eyedea is one of the most outspoken egotistical B-Boys I have ever heard; and at 22 years of age, he has accomplished a lot. Mowing down MCs at nearly ever DJ battle he has competed in. He definitely has the skills to back up what he's preaching. Abilities compliments Eyedea perfectly, with his landscapes of unique rhythms and sounds. Battling is also one of Abilities strong points. This duo is untouchable when you realize that all this explosive sound is made from just two techs and a mic. These guys are full of potential and I am already betting that their next album will be a masterpiece along with their others."
2,"ive been listining to eyedea for about 4 years now, since i was in grade 9. i didnt really get into him untill i first saw scribble jam and saw that hes truly one of the sickest mc's of this generation. When i first heard ""first born"" my expectations were very high but it didnt dissapoint, in fact i was even more in love with eyedeas work than before. this c.d. shows so much depth, wisdom, and raw talent that it is, to this day, one of my favorites along with amospheres lucy ford, sage francis's personal journals and sweatshop unions local 604."
2,The book is a good way to keep up with changes in treatment of type one and type two diabetes. Those of us who have diabetes need to have a reference book that is updated with the latest treatment tools and diagnostic explanations. This book does that in a language easy to understand.
2,"Young Conan's parents are murdered by a horde of vicious warriors who then enslave the young child for years. He is eventually released from slavery and taught the ancient arts of fighting. Transforming himself into a killing machine, Conan travels into the wilderness seeking vengeance on the man responsible for his family's murder. Conan the Barbarian is a very well made movie. The action is exciting, the visuals are great, the directing, story, everything about this movie is incredible."
2,"I love these they make a good snack for me while doing my school work.I have to hide and dole these out a little at a time or I will eat too many of them. I take a small bag in my pocket when I am on campus and need a bite to eat. Two of my favorite things, dried cherries and yogurt. Yum!"
2,"This 2004 release by New Found Glory has it all: energy, emotion, meaningful lyrics, blasting riffs, and a few more mature, pensive tunes. My favorite moments here are when Jordan begins singing a song slow, then the band explodes into a fast-paced frenzy, like on the last track. The sing-along choruses of ""This Disaster"" and ""All Downhill From Here"" provide some catchy, energetic melodic bliss, and the absolute masterpiece is the track ""Truth of My Youth."" This track is sonically flawless, where the melody and harmony mix with the instruments and show just how pop-punk is done. This track along with Rufio's ""Still"" are perhaps the two greatest pop-punk songs ever written. Some of the material on the CD drags a bit, but with 15 tracks on the album, one could expect that. This album is packed with more singles than a Las Vegas Night Club, and as of 2007 has proven to be this band's high water mark so far."
2,"when i first read about new found glory getting more serious and hardcore in the magazines, i thought great, they are going to change completely!!! but i decided i would still buy the cd and give it a go!!! and i am so glad that i did because it is such a great cd, they may have changed slightly but they still have the catchy pop-punk that makes them new found glory!!! i recommend this cd to anyone!!!"
2,I love this cd! all of the songs are good! NFG is the best!!!!!!!!! I love this group and i cant wait till their concert!
2,"Si lo que te gusta es el sandungueo y no tienes este disco, ya estas tarde. Comparado con la mayoria del Regeaton Tego pone mas variedad, y varias canciones ni siquiera son regeaton. Plante Banderas es una Salsa de Tommy Olivencia por ejemplo, y se siente un poco de reggea de Yellowman en Bonsai. El mezclar estas y mas influencias le da a este disco un sabor sin igual.Ahora, Tego a veces usa mucha profanidad en este disco lo cual no le gusta a una gente. Si eso te molesta este no es un disco para ti, pero si eso te molesta probablemente no estarias mirando un disco de perreo."
2,"i think this book sat vocabulary for dummies is excellent to help the students to take a good grade in test, the book is in excellent condition and we recive in short time, thanks"
2,"I use this text in my spring sophomore-level mechanics class. There are no perfect texts for this level, but this is the best one out there. The book does assume that you either have a solid base of mathematics or are willing to learn during the course. That's typical in a physics class; you learn mathematics while learning physics, and so its a good introduction to the style of more advanced physics classes. While the chapter on nonlinearity doesn't fit well with the other chapters, and I wish Lagrangian's were moved later in the text, its still a better choice then most other texts for most students. Less mathematically prepared students could use Taylor's text, for example, and more mathematically prepared students should use Goldstein and landau, but this book aims at the middle of lower division physics majors."
2,"This is a collectors item, and contains official versions of Clash classics such as Career Opportunities, Charlie Don't Surf, Corner Soul, Guns on the Roof, Hateful, Hitsville U.K., I'm Not Down, I'm So Bored with the USA, Inoculated City, Ivan Meets GI Joe, Kingston Advice, London Calling, Lover's Rock, The Magnificent Seven, One More Time, Overpowered By Funk, Rebel Waltz, Rock the Casbah, Safe European Home, Should I Stay or Should I Go, Somebody Got Murdered, Something About England, Spanish Bombs, Straight to Hell, Train in Vain, Up in Heaven (not only here), Version City, Washington Bullets, and Whiteman in Hammersmith Palais."

2,"They were exactly like the ReliaMed Pads that came with my ReliaMed TENS unit. Fits exactly. You may get two uses out of each set, but I don't bother trying. If you're not moving, and they aren't going to be hanging upside-down, you can probably get two uses. Prep the skin with alcohol first."
2,"A fascinating fictionalised history: a collection of accounts of the liberation of Paris from the Nazis in 1944. Collins and Lapierre manage to string together a range of different narrative foci, using a kind of ficitonalised interior position in conjunction with documented history of the time. There are certain moments of privlege, and certain moments of exclusion, but a gripping and often touching read is the end result. You get the 'high end' of the story, with de Gaulle and Patton etc, but also many ordinary anecdotal stories, which are often the most interesting, and devastating. Many of the internal conflicts within the allied forces are laid bare for those that thought this was purely a 'them and us' kind of thing."
2,"This book does a good job helping you prioritize your relationship between work, success, family and personal growth, with clear & concrete advice. Like most books of this type, it suffers from the vacuum effect--advice as textbook. But it is inspirational and helpful. Coming from a completely different angle, I love how author Bruce Stockler discusses the way he shifted his priorities--work, marriage, kids--in ""I Sleep At Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets."" Very inspirational, but a humorous memoir, not a self-help book."
2,"I loved this!It marks the beginning of Almodovar's second golden period, with Live Flesh and All About My Mother. I dispute that it is rambling. It is no more rambling than All About My Mother... in fact I would suggest it is more coherent.The territory is classic Almodovar, but done with more poignancy than his earlier work. The frustrated confused lost romance novelist struggles through the chaos of her life to finally learn to believe in love, and the tango. Magic"
2,"Not the ""typical"" Almodovar film, and without the spectacular touch, but a good reflexion on confidence among other things. Humour and rhythm are Almodovar all right."
2,"This film is perhaps especially telling to people in their 40's and 50's, because character's search for love and comfort can only be fully appreciated by people of this age, who are more or less in the same situation as this woman-novelist with numerous emotional problems and no solution to them.She does find a solution eventually, but you have to wait until the end of the film to see that. It will not dissapoint you at all; in fact, it might surprise you a great deal...Wonderful supporting characters (e.g. novelist's mother and sister) make this film an outstanding thinking piece about human life. Very deep!"
2,"This cookbook had been recommended by a friend and it was just what my wife wanted.The best part is the ease with which you can find a fairly obscure book on Amazon. This would probably have been a special order item at a bookstore. And, I probably wouldn't have take the time."
2,I love this recipe book. It has a lot of recipes that will be easy to try. I like the layout and the design. Worth the purchase.
2,"Only tried a couple recipes so far, but they've been super. I really look forwarrd to trying more. I'm hooked on raosting veggies."
2,"This Book is awsome, but it gets kind of confusing, because there are about 19 different parralel universes in it. Don't get me wrong, I love Star Trek books with parallel universes in them. A must have book."
2,Another great book. Filled with nostalgic and informative profiles of dozens of plants that are great to grow and share.
2,"We had been wanting one of these for some time, and Amazon had a large selection and great prices. This one works great, and our two boys just love it. It easy easy to attach, easy to assemble all the attachments, and it rolls behind your bike like there is nothing there. The construction is good and as with one review I based nearly my entire decision on, the bottom (where their feet go) is not a solid base so we have to make sure the kids don't stand in it when they climb in. We don't get to use it as much as we like, but it says it can take 2 kids up to 50 lbs each, so we have several more years to use it. Now what do we do with the 3rd kiddo on the way? LOL!"
2,"When you push in the handle lever, the pole extends from both ends. It has a very comfortable foam cushion grip on most of the pole. It is built solid from aluminum. When a professional painter came over to paint my house I let him use my tools, and this is the one tool that went missing. I guess he liked it. I bought another one because the comfort and adjustable reach helps increase endurance on lengthy painting projects. I found the 2' to 4' length most practical. With the standard threads on the end this can be used for more than just paint rollers; it can be used for many cleaning attachments as well."
2,"Enamora fragrancePerry is a captivating scent that France alone, each time I use it gives the feeling of excellence to attract attention by the sweet scent that combines the delight of the perfume with the image of a current"
2,"When I first saw the album cover for this, I thought it kind of odd, mixing politics with music. I thought it even odder, a politician being a good musician and a really good one. Needless to say, this is a very classy, country music album. It really doesn't get much better, and I think it ranks right up there with Hank and Lefty and the big boys. If the Governor was as good a politician as he was a musician, then the State of Louisiana used to be in good hands."
2,"I have just read the book, and as a WW2 merchantman I just realized how lucky I was to have been sailing in the Pacific where all I had to put up with was an occasional Kamikazi, and ""Friendly Fire"", because the Japs didn't understand the true use of the subs like their allies, the Germans did.I have just ordered the movie, and if it gets across the fear that I felt when I had to go below deck to the engine room when I was under attack as well as the book does, it will deserve a five star rating."
2,"I thought this was a pretty good book. Well written and descriptive. I love England and it certainly portrayed the time of WWII for the two families in involved, a pretty bleak time. It moves along steadily but isn't a page turner in terms of not being able to put it down. It is one of those books you enjoy when you are reading and can go back to when you feel like it."
2,"Best and total FLIP THE FROG complete animation. It has all of Ub Iwerks' FLIP THE FROG animation in total. Animation REALLY has smooth and fast animation and worth studying. Amazing imagination. Better than any MICKEY MOUSE Film. Ub Iwerks really knew what he was doing.My favorites were ROOM RUNNERS and THE CUCKOO mURDER CASE and MOVIE MAD and SPOOKS and SODA SQUIRT. Get this collection or you will feel sorry. --- Luisa Felix, Hoboken, New Jersey. Amazon best buy!!!!!"
2,i love books by jodi picoult...she keeps me wanting to read 'just one more chapter' she's hard to put down! i have read just about all of her current books...
2,"Americans like to tell themselves that this film is camp as a defense mechanism to lesson its power.Yet the reality of the American Dream is that in it's ultimate realization, that being the life of Elvis, that dream amounted to sitting for six hours in a constipated stupor only to end up drowning in an ocean of drug -laced puke.This is the news, and no one hates news (Or an unhappy ending) like we do."
2,Great history on the mourning customs (some I did not even know about). Lots of great pics with pricing. Best book that I have found on the subject.
2,This is the eighth book of Movie Posters that I have purchased from Bruce Hershenson and each time I remark on the extremely high quality of the reproductions. This is obviously a job done from the heart but the visual aspects of the book strikes something in the sub-conscious and suddenly you are back in some cinema watching that movie again. More than just a coffee-table book but a reference source and one to take to work and get a discussion going as an alternative to football. A great read and highly recommended.
2,"Duvall delivers again. This is no surprise as he and the movie will both be nominated come Academy time. As Bum Phillips once said about a player on his Houston Oilers team, ""He might not be in a class by himself but it sure don't take long to call roll..."" Duvall is simply the best!"
2,"Robert Duvall is a man's man. Always has and always will be. He'll make a movie and if you don't like it...so what.But none of his movies have been ""so whats"" in my mind.Especially ""Get Low"". This shows another side of Duvall and it's dark, humerous and guilty.But for the guilt...it's time for it to go.I love this man and his attitude."
2,Robert Duvall was amazing in this role........really got into his character. A time where a man's words meant something and a horrible secret that was meant reveal his true character.
2,"Well, it's Robert Duvall. Do I really need to say much more. He's such a great actor, although, I thought the supporting case were great also."
2,"I was pleasantly surprised by this thin volume. The first 30 or so pages get bogged down in introductory material, including a dedication, acknowledgments, a forward, an 'onward', a preface, a parable, a 'clarion call', another preface, and an introduction. However, once the book actually starts, things take off. Despite the subject, which is difficult to capture in words, the book actually contains effective and practical tools for attuning to your true core and to the universe itself. Unfortunately, one of the main tools is potions and elixirs available only at a website. However, I found the many 'invocations' to be quite effective as affirmations. This shouldn't be your only or even your main source on your life journey, but I consider this a nice addition to my library."
2,"I've taken this newspaper on and off for several years. Whenever I let my subscription lapse, I miss it. There's lots of very interesting and useful information that isn't in other newspapers or magazines, plus I always enjoy the fiction sections as well as the puzzle pages. Unfortunately, there are more mistakes (typos) than I'd like to see, but you just have to overlook them."
2,"This is one of many Hello Kitty books/calendars I own and it sits on my desk, providing information, a place to write quick notes and a place I can flip through to appreciate pretty pictures and cute drawings. If you're a calendar buff like me, the layout of this book is very good, especially when you are making notes or planning your week. I also use a Palm PDA, and will make notes on the calendar first then when I am updating my Palm info, use the calendar as a reference. The biggest bonus is that it is HELLO KITTY!I can't wait for the 2003 edition! ..."
2,I loved this book. Mrs Brenda Jackson has done it again.Please go out and get this book as soon as possible.The Westmorlands are going to be a trip.I think they are going to be five brothers that put you in the mind of Clayton Maderis. I loved the love scenes they are HOT HOT HOT!
2,"This is the story of Christian the Lion, so as the song tells us (!), from a London zoo, and furniture store, and finally to the African wild, and to an encounter with a wonderful elderly man named George Adamson. There are a number of different cuts and encasements of this story: but this is the original right footage right here. It does not, contain, evidently, *all* the old footage, but it does contain the essential footage - that is, at least from what I know, and I have seen three versions... Additionally, this DVD is the 'vintage presentation', which I rather enjoy, with the 'song of Christian' running merrily through it. Yes, this film does tend to be somewhat grainer; but it is not a nuisance, and is still wonderfully enchanting. But really all versions of this remarkable story must prove a gripping experience! Most recommended."
2,"I know that it is not an album that is one to remember, but the songs are great to listen to and ""Cherrie Pie"" has become one of my favorite J.LO songs. I enjoy it and recommend it.It is what it is!"
2,"This has 2 b her best album 2 D8!!!! trust me!!! i dnt no if evry1 els is listnin 2 the same cd as me but she sounds real good and the songs r ALLLLLLLL GOOD!!!!!!!!!Standout tracksGet right (original and remix)step into my worldWhatever you wanna doCherry pieRyde Or DieI, LoveSO ITS A GOOD CD BUY IT NOW!!!! u wnt b disapointed"
2,"CD REBIRTH is perfect. My favourite songs are: Get right, Step into my world, Hold you down, Whatever you wanna do, I got U, (Can't believe) This is me...I think that song (Can't believe) This is me: is the best from this CD.That's a pity that isn't duet with Marc Anthony here."
2,"I don't know why people are saying such hurtfull things about britney. It must make them feel better or whatever. She has great music, she is sexy and she is only human. why are people calling her slutty. she works hard for her body so why not show it off. mabey people are just jeolous. I mean you may say bad things about her but your boyfriend wants her and you could only wish to look like her. I love all britneys songs and she is so awesome."
2,"I love what Britney is doing with her career. With each album, she's getting trampier and trampier as she comes to the realization we all knew a long time ago, the girl just can't sing. I have no problem if you can't sing as long as you are aware that your point in the industry is to give guys something to white water wrist to. That is exactly when she has done. The whole thing at the VMAs with Madonna was great, ""I'm Britney Spears and I'm losing my fanbase so I'm going to kiss Madonna. Did you hear that, I'm going to kiss Madonna! That will shock you!"" She is wearing less and less, trying to sing less and less and covering songs that weren't even good in the first place. To say she does a horrible cover of ""My perogative"" is in insult on so many levels. She manages to be worse than Bobby Brown, wow. I can only hope we start seeing more girl on girl action in the future and I'm guessing we will. I like the direction Britney, keep it up!"
2,"I like but the promotion song My Prerogative is too boring anything compared with what she accustoms to make, also good lacks songs one that I like too much Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know is very good, it should have put Overprotected in the original version the one that put it is bad, of rest I find excellent."
2,"I bought the rings as a fitness product. The mounting chains are way too short. You'll have to use climbing webbing or rope to extend it. Muscleups are extremely difficult on rings this size, though pullups, dips, and pushups are great. You may have to put a cover over the chain as it can aggrevate your arm during pushups and dips."
2,"This film is very enjoyable to anyone with an interest in Science Fiction. It is a typical Stephen King classic,"
2,i am a huge steven king movie fan i got most of his great films. in this there is a lady that discovers a spaceship and digs out. there is something in the air or something but the next thing you know everyone is controlled by spaceship. i liked this movie if you are a king fan you may like this movie.
2,"Good CD that demonstrates the old, west coast style of hip-hop. One of 2Pac's great albums, with great lyrics and mellow beats."
2,This cd is a must buy! This cd might be old but is a Classic. It has phat beats the lyrics are dope and dayum what can i say its one of the best works of Tupac. They might be just 10 songs but trust me you will get ur moneys worth. Buy it!
2,"Smells like you're cooking w/ a barrel of fresh basil. Aromatic, fresh and clean smelling basil - an interesting choice for incense."
2,This movie had quite a few nice twists. I liked the development of some of the actors.
2,there were great albums released in the early 90's and late 80's like Organized Konfusion-self titled and Slick Rick-Great Adventures but this cd compared to those have pretty bad beats but still worth buying for to collect all of pacs cd's and brendas got a baby is a classic for now and years to comeFavorite Track:Brenda's Got A Baby8 of 10 lyrics 6 of 10 beats
2,"This is a well-written and entertaining book, giving a detailed account of the Kennedy family before and during the war. However, contrary to what the title may suggest, the bulk of the book focuses on the Kennedy family prior to the war and their own participation in it. Much of the book is devoted to the time Joe Sr. spent as ambassador to Great Britain and Jack and Joe Jr spent travelling the world, as opposed to the book being exculsively about their time in the service. Very little of the book is actually devoted to that time, which does not take anything away from the quality of the book, but does make the title slightly misleading. None the less, an excellent examination of the Kennedys during that tumultuous time in American history."
2,"My mother loves Precious moments. This figurine completed their cake table for their 50th Anniversary beautifully. Gold tablecloth with white lace tablecloth over, gold charger plates, white china, gold cake doily on plate, hand made and decorated individual anniversary cakes on each plate in white with touches of gold, gold framed black and white wedding picture enlarged, white and yellow roses and carnations and Mom's 50th Anniversary Precious Moments figurine - Perfect Completer Piece!"
2,There are qualities that each of us are born with and those that are obtain through mentoring. This book realizes that we seek options and opinions. This gives anyone in management the operating tool to use time wisely and make decision effectively.
2,"Peter Drucker is simply one of the very best of all time. The Effective Executive, albeit over 40 years old, still applies as much as the day it was published. If you're serious about improving your performance as an executive, this book is a must read."
2,"As an author and an intellectual, the late Peter F. Drucker was a true business sage. Recognized as the father of modern management, Drucker forecast numerous pivotal trends, including decentralization, privatization and the development of the information society. He introduced the concept of the ""knowledge worker,"" a term he employs widely in this fascinating book. His internal study of General Motors, Concept of the Corporation, greatly influenced how businesses conduct their affairs. Each Drucker book is a genuine business classic, including this one. getAbstract believes it will help you think productively about what you do. No one writes more intelligently or presciently on management and its functions than Drucker. All executives, even those who are already effective, will benefit from reading this informative, enlightening book."
2,I've purchased this book a dozen times as gifts for people I work with or know who could benefit from Peter Drucker's wisdom. He's an icon and I highly recommend this book!
2,This sponge does miracles. This product is essential to every pet owner out there. I find it most effective on sofas and chairs as it allows you to rub the sponge across the material to catch and remove pet hairs from the surface. I don't recommend using this product on soft fabrics such as a sweater or coat.
2,"Paine mixes Laughtere and Joye in perfect measure. The wonder is how convincing his many divergent characterizations are. The social commentary, beneath it all, is stirring."
2,"If you like hard core Rap, you will love this album. 50 has proved that he has the talent to become a very successful rapper. All of the songs on this cd has great potential to become a number 1 single. Some of the highlights are: ""What Up Gangsta"", ""In Da Club"", Many Men"", ""Patiently Waiting"" and ""High All The Time"". Every song is really good, there are no fillers here. Eminem and Dre found some great talent here. I HIGHLY recommend that you purchase this cd. You won't regret it!"
2,fifty's got it goin on. he's bomb. later for the haters. oh ya patiently waiting is the bomb track cuz you get to hear both 50 & eminem's SEXY voices!!!
2,Boom.50 is finally here.This is a classic album.Anytime you sell 7 million copies its a classic.This Cd is a 4 out 5.With the story to many men and 21 questions this cd has both high lyric content and good beat.The only thing you may not like is too much songs about killing or shooting.Still after hearing this you'll turn Gangsta.
2,"It was good. Real good. Better than my last girlfriend. J/k. My favorite song on the CD is ""many men"". I just wish the new hail mary was on it. Ja u goin down. Eminem and Juggalos unite against Ja Rule!!!"
2,"50 Cent's best ablum. I don't see how people can hate on 50, he's rich, he's tough and his lyrics are tight. GG G-unit"
2,"The reason why i say if you have a CD burner, burn this CD, is because, well, its a great CD, but some of the songs, you just get tired of hearing afterwards. But songs like, U not like me, wanksta, poor lil rich, and high all the time. I could never get tired of. And as for Ava. If hope yer a girl man, cause wit a name like that seems like you gon' get punked all da time. And if you feel like yer in the position to be talkin all that kinna sh*t about 50, against what probably more than a million people say(that hes a great artist) then where the f*ck is yer CD you've put out on da market lately? If you aint got a CD out then DONT TALK SH*T. And quit being a hater. Just because 50 is burning the kinna money you would never see in yer life for firewood!"
2,"This is an instant classic. Out of ninteen songs, there are maybe three that i will skip over. They are not bad songs, just a little subpar. 50 is obviouly a survivor. This man has worked to get what he wanted. Being orphined at eight, being shot nine times, being stabbed, and selling crack, this man cannot be brought down. Get this album while they are still shipping the DVDS in the package! biography, music video, and more! All he needs to do now is watch his back, not get shot again. im out payce"
2,"50 in my view is easily the best rapper around, i dunno wat it is it maybe coz he has a mixture of gangster attiude with the higly focused rapper attitude maybe dats why he is so big. Anyway i have been listening to 50s music for years but only now i have seen after his shooting his voice developed a sort of metaphorfises from a good mc to a phenomenon. Get rich or die tryin does definetly do 50s capabilities justice its easily his best album yet. As they say for 50 ""SKY IS THE LIMIT"""
2,"This album is the hottest thing out there now. They ain't nuttin worth skippin ahead on this album, no filler. We all been waitin for 50 Cent to drop dis thing, and it was worth the wait. ..."
2,"50 Cent must be the most brilliant lyricist in the rap game today. Take ""In the Club"" for instance.. ""Go go go shorty, it's your birthday.. We gone party like it's you're birthday"". A thousand monks meditating for a thousand years could not fathom the depth of 50s insightful lyrics. hm.. Birthday. Wow."
2,"What can i say about this album? This is the hottest album out there. 50 cent has the gansta attitude most rappers now lack (e.g. Ja rule, Jay-Z, etc.) He takes his life and makes it into a masterpiece with this album. The beats and lyrics in this album are impressive and is full of ""Heat"". With the collaboration of Eminem and the G-unit soldiers, this album is a most have. From the intro to the last track this album can match those greats like ""Illmatic"" and ""Ready to die"". 50 is going to take the throne of hip hop. GGGG-UNIT"
2,"it's always like this: when someone gets reallysuccessful, some people start hatin' for thereason that the person has made it. why the hellshould u criticize 50 for this album? it's got alot of good rap tunes (""Many Men"", ""Back Down"",""Bloodhound"", ""Poor Lil Rich"", ""Wanksta"" are myfavs), and yeah he doesn't rap like others he'sgot a little speech problem but why should u disshim for that? he's spitting real street sh**. he'srappin' the way thugs talk. respect this man 4 doin'it & stop hatin'!"
2,Most complete and true to the novel treatment. No captions available which makes it hard to understand at times. Great for die-hard Austen fans.
2,"I'm mystified as to why the two other reviews here rate this album so poorly, I absolutely *love* this record. I got ""The Irony of a Sweet Fruit"" at the end of summer '06, and I listened to it constantly through all of that fall and winter, and still enjoy putting it on to this day. The record has a very strong vibe and the songs are very affecting. In response to the mentioned issue of audio quality, I don't think the sound is bad at all. The sound quality is on par with that of many of my favorite indie records, and I think the production suits the material so well that I couldn't imagine a more polished version being any better (nor would I want to). This is the best kind of record, the kind that sparks my emotions when I listen to it, evokes feelings and memories, makes me feel alive. Just thought I'd add my opinion and rating here because I was so shocked by seeing one star ratings given to a record that I hold so dear. I highly recommend it."
2,These pans work very nicely. Heat evenly and fast. Love the glass covers. price was right. Would recommend anyone to purchase.
2,"I was given this set as a Christmas gift in 2010 and have to say it has been put to the test! The big pot is perfect for making spagetti to feed my family of 4 and to make home made soups. The smaller pots are good for making stuffing, mac & cheese, etc. I agree it would be nice if there was a pot size inbetween the biggest and the smaller ones. Also, this set does not come with a frying pan that is very big. So keep that in mind. But, we like that we can prepare smaller meals for just the kids or just the grown ups with them. Overall, this is a very nice set!"
2,"I saw the very first two episodes of season #1 on a cruise ship. I was a little under the weather and was flipping the remote trying to find something to watch. Came across this one and was hooked. Vowed when I got back home I would put it on my ""must list"" of shows to watch. If you're in a funk and need something to pull you out of it...watch a couple of these and you'll be back to normal. Enjoy...."
2,This paper is great It has canon printed on one side so you know the difference between the two sides. the pictures come out clear and concise. I am not a professional but I cant tell the difference between the pictures i printed and the ones from the lab. i believe its all in the printer and paper. They are all from from canon
2,"This album is simply a classic record every single song on it is good or at least worth listening to if your a person that is hard to please, this album has great lyrics (which is the same 4 all of pacs albums) and it also has great beats the only thing i could say is that the sound quality of the songs isnt so good compared to the stuff like me against the world and other classics closer to his death, I highly reccomend you buy this album and here is a listing of my favourite tracksHoller If Ya Hear MeLast WordzRepresentin' 93Keep Ya Head UpThe Streetz R DeathrowI Get AroundPapa'z Song"
2,"I absolutely love this video. Very relaxing, and it makes you feel incredible. I was looking for some videos to keep in shape while I am pregnant, and this one is one of my favorites. It is long, 50 minutes, so I don't always get all of the way through it because I have other children and alot to do!!! But it is wonderful because all three women in the video are pregnant in different stages of pregnancy, so you can watch them and change your moves if you need to. I strongly recommend this video to any pregnant woman who is trying to stay in shape while you are pregnant!!"
2,If you have to stick your fingers twice a day this is the way to go. There is less pain than I had been expecting and the price is not bad.
2,"I built shelving using Kreig joints and they worked extremely well. However, I found the coarse screws had considerably better holding strength compared to the fine threaded versions."
2,"Segal has, by far, put out the best martial arts films ever.I really liked his 1st 4 movies when I saw them. They were very entertaining. This was entertaining, had a great plot and was well acted. Tommy lee jones and Gary Busey were good also. looking back on his(Segals) earlier films I realized just how big a movie this one was for him, considering that the movies he made before this one were good, but had lost there appeal. This one is a classic."
2,This moive is packed with great actions. It is the one of the best Steven Seagal movie. The storyline may be a bit silly but it is great entertainment.
2,"After her adopted parents die, wealthy Marjorie searches out her destitute birth parents and siblings. The story involves why she had been adopted, romance, conversion testimonies, as well as health and wealth issues, and much suspicion from a twin sister. Brentwood is the name of the home they had in more plentiful times that represents the successful concluding reunion of this almost destroyed family."
2,"This album has to go in your archives. Has several hits from back in the day. Including ""summertime"" which was his biggest hit."
2,I HAVE BEEN USING THIS TORCH FOR ABOUT TWO MONTHS AND AM SUPRISED AT HOW LONG A SMALL BOTTLE OF PROPANE WILL LAST. NO NEED TO LUG AROUND ONE OF THOSE 20 lbs. CYLINDERS. THE SMALL BOTTLE LASTED FOR ABOUT 3 1/2 HOURS. THIS TORCH WORKS AS WELL AS ANYONE I'VE SEEN.
2,In his Sceond book dealing with endangered species Mac Priebe again tells a compelling tale of the sucess of the removal of the second species from the endangered list.This book maintains a high level of educational value with out overwelming the intended audence with scientific data.I am a bird watcher for many years and realy did enjoy this book.Scott Wright
2,Fred Hammond outdid himself this time with Pages of Life. This CD will be an all time favorite of mines. The songs of praise and worship is so awesome that you can't help but to hear them ringing in your head and spirit all day long. Fred Hammond is truly an example of what Christian Gospel music should be like. Something for the old and also something for the young people. I pray that God will continue to use him mightily in this day and time.
2,This book will enlighten you to knowledge that really makes sense. IT is written clearly and many answers to what are government and religious institutions agendas really are.
2,"These treats look and smell like they could be enjoyed by anyone, including people! And my dogs just ate them with relish. My only reason for rating them 4 instead of 5 is because the size is huge for my little 10 pound buddies. Also, the pieces aren't a consistent size. Some are very large while some are half the size of others. Although it appears some have broken in the box, the majority are quite think and I doubt I can easily break the larger ones in half should I choose to do so to try and get a more reasonable size for my dogs. Of course, they aren't complaining about the bigger size!"
2,"These treats are around $6-8 a box where I live, so the price on Amazon is great! I bought a case of six mid-November, and my dog is finally on his last box. He normally goes through a $10 bag of Beggin' Strips in a week, so we're saving a LOT on doggie treats.As for the flavor, my dog will eat just about any treat, but he seems to be more excited about these than most hard treats (he usually prefers soft ones). I like that they smell good, unlike some similarly priced treats, which seems to reduce stinky doggie breath (and I'll admit it, I tasted one... wasn't too impressed with the flavor, but they're not for me!).The only downside is that some of the treats are HUGE, but they can be broken up into smaller pieces."
2,It smells good.My dog loves this.The price is right.And it has low fat.What else can I say?
2,"I had the pleasure of seeing Will Haven on tour promoting this record (with Soulfly, Neurosis, and Hatebreed) way back in 1998. I thought they were fantastic, most of the concertgoers just stood dumb-founded as they played. My favorite thing about this record is the guitar playing, love how it just drives everything. The guitar playing in an off-time such as 3/4 or 7/8 and cranked to 11 on almost every track here. The rhythem section is real solid as well and Grady justs barks over the whole record, really enjoyable if you fancy that kind of thing. The band sounds somewhat similar to early Deftones records, but is far from an imitation of the Deftones, always shifting and full of tension. Grady on vocals sound nothing like Chino from the Deftones. The vocals are more in a Metalcore / Death Metal style but is really neither of the above. Good lyrics, Good Sound, Good Band."
2,"Will haven fallow up there 1997 masterpiece el diablo with WHVN. WHVN feels like a radio broadcast with some static, and ends with sign off(the national anthem). Alot of songs on WHVN or well done, but one sticks out like sore-thumb a remix of the classic will haven song ""i've seen my fate"". The remix kind of throws off the whole vibe this album creates. In the end WHVN serves up, some good, chaotic, and very hard will haven material and is a lot better than alot of the music that out there right now."
2,"Very good commentary, brief and to the point; not too wordy and shorter than other commentaries, while still holding a good overview of the books!"
2,"This movie is by far one of the best, if not the best Fantasy movie of all time and unlike some game based movies, creates the feeling of the game. Although some people who either don't like or are unfamilar with the game may not like it, I don't know why those people have to discourage everone else who might see it , those who like Dungeons & Dragons and other Roll Playing Games (RPGs) will almost certainly love this movie.The movie has everthing you would expect out of game Heros, Vilans, Monsters, Magic, Magic Weapons, Etc.If you like the game or are into fantasy movies then you have to see Dungeons & Dragons!if you don't like fantasy movies,unless you have a valid point, don't write reviews that might discourage people who like fantasy from getting this one just because you personally didn't like it and stick to writing reviews for movies you do like."
2,"This is the best movie I have ever seen. Even though that Wayan's Brother's person was in it, it still did not detract from the greatness of the movie. The movie portrayed accurately and very nicely the forboding sense of onimosity and the greatness of DnD, and kept the adventure (even though they were approx. 3rd level Rouges fighting Beholders (CR 17)) very believable and true to the Dungeons and Dragons ideal. Role playing is the most awesome way in the world to kill time...., even), and this movie should definitely create some spark in the interest of it. Buy it! Its awesome! The CG is good, too!"
2,"This was the second release by the Supremes without Diana Ross. It contains the huge hit ""Stoned Love"" that has an incredible intro melding it with Together We Can Make Sweet Music.""This was one of my favorite Supremes LP and it deserves to be on WIDE release CD again. I am hoping that we see more LP's into CD like Diana's ""Last Time I Saw Him"" & the Supremes' ""Mary, Sherrie & Susaye."""
2,"For the price range the Pflueger President series will be difficult to better.I own three President's and two XT's and they are all great performers.Smooth,lightweight and consistent they aren't prefect but few reels are.Tremendous bargain thru Amazon."
2,"The best (scariest) part of this novel is that it's now ""far fetched"" like most stuff in this genre. Cockfield uses actual science and the real world to create a scenario that really REALLY hits home as you read it.This is not a book for people who want to escape into a fantasy world. It's fiction, but not. I highly reccomend it to anyone who's either into Michael Creighton or the Left Behind series of books. It has elements of both. A good read, worth getting."
2,"You can be a predator...Or prey.Camouflage might be a state of mind.As a fifty-something gentleman who remembers the early days of paintball when it was all ""One Shot - One Kill"" and your marker had to be cocked between rounds and often misfired, I watched ""Team of One, The Paintball Sniper"" from experience.Back in those days, most teams used the skirmish line and ""firing squad"" approach. Five guys or so would sweep the woodlot playing field in a loose group, taking cover and firing at will when the enemy was engaged. The better marksmen with better cover and a little luck emerged victorious... especially if they managed to catch their enemy offguard and in smaller numbers.I worked alone.""Team of One, The Paintball Sniper"" brought back memories.It offers sound advice and practical lessons on honing the skills and strategies necessary to become an effective paintball sniper. Find knowledge when and where you can and use what works for you.Very highly recommended."
2,"We are through three weeks of study using this workbook and we found it to be thought provoking, biblically based and it does a good job of sending you to the bible for reference. If you or your group is interested in learning more about the spiritual realm this book is a good choice."
2,Purchased this back in 2010 prior to the 2010 Molokai Hoe (canoe race from the island of Molokai to Oahu). Used to keep my clothes and supplements dry on the chase boat during the race back to Oahu. Second sealline bag I've purchased.
2,"The 20L dry bag (green) served us well on our recent rafting trip through the Grand Canyon. We used it to carry our personal gear (camera, clothes, first aid materials...) while on the raft during the day. It kept the gear dry when closed properly. I debated on size to get but this size was good for us. It can fold down smaller when less is put inside. It would be easier to have a bag that is not like a stuff bag and opens wider but for the price, this was a great bag."
2,"This is an extremely durable dry sack. I've completely submerged this sack, and everything has remained dry. Unfortunately, I bought the 55L sack to keep the contents of my 65L backpack dry, and the material is way too stiff inside the pack. It's very hard to get anything in or out. Nonetheless, I appreciate the quality of this product, so I'm going to pick up a 60L SealLine Storm Sack to see if the lighter material works out better in my backpack."
2,"I'm a big jazz fan so Michael W. Smith is new to me. My wife listens to a local Christian station and thus I was exposed to the music. When I first heard a Michael W. Smith I knew right away this guy was good. Live the Life is an excellent CD. Like many of us, I can identify with Missing Persons. I also find Live the Life a powerful song. I was surprised to learn that he wrote In My Arms Again for the movie Titanic. Song For Rich is a nice bagpipe tune. Hello, Good-Bye brought me to tear because I almost lost my little one after he was born. That one hit very close to home. I find this whole CD a power influence. I also bought his 2 Christmas CD's."
2,"Eddie Hunt story has touched not only my life but that of my 14yr old son who has found Eddies book to be a treasure he will always hold dear to his heart. It has helped him through many of his own trials related to his disability. This is a book for all ages, as well as for those with a wide range of abilities."
2,"If you've ever thought about running away and joining a Flea Circus, this video will give you EVERYTHING you need to know. It's loaded with detail, and runs you through every step in the process with attention to specific points and tips that will help ensure the best Flea Circus possible!Walt Noon and ""friends"" have though of everything to make the show itself an aesthetic and mechanical marvel. Besides that, his attitude is both ""down home"" and professional. Even if you never build a circus, it's a kick to watch!"
2,"One of the top ten westerns of all time and what a superb cast, Clint is brilliant as the retired gunslinger turned hog farmerWill Munny turning one last hit job. Very brutal showing the west without the glamor"
2,"A great movie .... has all the desirable features, impressive sound, 1080p picture quality, original audio (which was filmed), and Spanish subtitles. Recommended by 100%.Si bien dije que no me gustan los western americanos (prefiero los spaghetti), tengo algunas excepciones, esta es una, ..... mas que un western, esta pelÃ­cula es mucho mas prefunda, los que no la han visto, vÃ¡anla se llevaran una grata sorpresa."
2,"The dark message comes through in this Eastwood creation of classic western genre. It is a foreboding and frightening tale of a bad man turned good then returning to his past - or is it that his past is coming back to drag him down again? The cynicism is thick in the theme that there is no one good. And even the bad are in for more than what they bargained for in this hard-hitting gun-slinging action drama. If you enjoy the do-good classics, you may not like this film which is a little heavy-handed in its realism concerning the use of violence to settle scores. Like most cynical statements, it is difficult to swallow and leaves you uneasy whether you enjoy the realism or dislike the taste it leaves behind. The story is moving and you cannot help but uneasily relate to the main character in all his violent flaws."
2,"I agree with the previous reviewer that the two 1974 versions of Breadfan and ...Powdered Milk are the best things on the album. They are two of the heaviest recordings I've ever heard, even heavier than most of Sabbath's Live at Last, and that's saying something. Too bad the drummer on those two tracks, Pete Boot, was a fill-in who only stayed in the band a year. The Impeckable material is a highlight, too, especially Love for You and Me. Get this CD while you can."
2,"This gripping story about mixed up teenage basketball star Jim Carroll shows Leonardo Dicaprio at his cinematic best. With friends Mickey, Pedro and Neutron Jim swaggers around New York city like he owns the place. Their lives revolve around basketball and drugs and in the end it catches up with them all, leaving the penniless junkies battling to survive on New York's mean streets."
2,My took his hair out right away. He did like him for a while and learned some spanish from him.
2,Fan of A.W.K. or not you will love this CD. Every song is an awesome slamming experience. Buy this CD and in one week it will be the only CD you listen to. Live Hard and Party Hard!!!!!!!!!!!
2,"CDs / Product was a good price, quick shipping and overall good experience. I may have missed the fact that it was a used library copy. These have a tendency to be more abused and to have more scratches in the CDs and this one was no exception. So far though, CDs have been working fine.Thanks,"
2,"Book was shipped promptly, received quickly, and arrived in excellent condition.Mosley, of course, achieved fame through his Easy Rawlins books, but he hasn't limited himself to these, and this book was a try atwriting Easy Rawlins material in short story form. The stories arefine, but they don't fully succeed because his characters and plotsare too complex to be fully presented in only 40 pages or so. Perhaps that's why he hasn't attempted this format since."
2,Six Pieces is a must get for any true Easy Rawlins fan. It has suspense Is or Isn't Mouse alive? It has drama What's going with Bonnie? This is a true wonderful book. No wonder Walter Mosley is my favorite author.
2,"Having read a number of books on lymphoma aimed at different audiences, I was leery of this book. Boy was I wrong - Living with Lymphoma is an excellent book filled with the information that patients, loved ones, and friends can use during diagnosis and treatment. Adler gives a personal touch from the patient perspective without making the book a personal journal and she does not skimp on the medical details you need as each type of lymphoma is different requiring different treatment details.While no book seems to click with every person, this book is:- Current as to treatments in use today, not in 1999- Aimed at a wide audience without skimping or overloading- Affordable compared to specialized medical textsIf you would like a modern, practical, and affordable book on Hodgkin's or Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, you should look at Living with Lymphoma first and foremost."
2,"I received a copy of this book from my Sister-in-Law who's husband, my brother, had also recently been treated for NHL. It was a very informative read, and helped allay my fears of the impending Chemo, etc. because I knew in advance what to expect. I acquired a copy recently for a friend who had recently been diagnosed with Lymphoma."
2,"I bought and read this book because it was on my son's summer reading list. From page one I felt like Lance Armstrong was talking to me. Through his simplistic, descriptive style, I became a part of his life. I became entranced; I couldn't put it down. It made me laugh and it made me cry. I was on edge as if I were on the sidelines. It taught me about cycling, about cancer, about the life of a survivor. I had never thought about any of these things, and I became educated without trying. It's a fascinating book. If you admire people who are willing to work hard at what they do, you will love it. If you know someone who has had cancer and/or is a cancer survivor, you will learn more about that person, and you will love it."
2,"A story of courage, transformation, inspiration, love, failure, success, it has absolutely every element of the most thrilling book you have ever read. Get this book if you want to laugh, cry, scream, shout and jump for joy. Lance's triumph over his bought with cancer will leave you feeling grateful, in awe, and thoroughly filled with life-affirming happiness."
2,"I loved this book. It is very inspirational for anyone dealing with cancer. It is also just a great read. Lance Armstrong comes across as a regular guy, with human failings, but with a phenominal talent, and great dedication and determination. He has done a great service by writing this book."
2,"This autobiography from Lance Armstrong gives one a good sense of who he is (amazing cylcist, cancer survivor, somewhat-spoiled superstar athlete, etc.) and what drives him. The book focuses on his struggle with cancer and comeback to cycling. It's really quite amazing what he did and what he keeps doing. The story is told in a very conversational manner which is very easy to listen to (I was listening to the Audio CD). I imagine it is a very quick read too.AUDIO CD WARNING - Be forewarned if you listen to the Audio CD - it is very poorly formatted. There is only one track per CD and it will immediately start repeating as you finish the CD - so you find yourself thinking ""Hmm, this sounds familiar"" and then notice you have started over. Most Audio CDs are savvy enough to put music or at least a pause in."
2,"I AM A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL AND WAS GIVEN THE ASSIGNMENT OF READING A NOVEL ON A CONTEMPORARY ISSUE; CANCER BEING ONE OF THE MANY LISTED. I CHOSE TO READ LANCE'S BOOK AND READ IT COVER TO COVER IN ABOUT 2 HOURS. THE PROJECT WAS SUPPOSED TO LAST ABOUT 8 WEEKS. OOOPS! THE BOOK WAS VERY POWERFUL TO ME SEEING AS HOW MY MOTHER HAD CANCER, MY STEP-FATHER MOUNTAIN BIKE RACES, AND I LOVE READING. THE BOOK IS GREAT AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ALL WHO READ THIS!!! :)"
2,Ive always been a Lance Armstrong fan and this is a great book telling of his story before his fame and through his second Tour win. Its a good read and a good story.
2,This book is just amazing. Its full a life lessons and inspiration. Its a classic one could read over an over again. Thanks Lance.
2,"I am an avid runner and a recreational biker. I understand what it takes to train and to push when you really do not feel like it.After reading this book, I was so inspired. The subject of the book makes you realize how precious every breath you take really is. This is an amazing story about an amazing man. I just kept saying over and over again, ""How did he do this?"" Where did he get the guts to come back from this? It is very hard to understand how the heck this man was able to come back and win the Tour de France after what he went through.After reading the book I vowed never to complain about running in bad weather, or blow off a run when I didn't feel well.It is truly a book you MUST read. It will help you in ways you never thought possible. This is not a story I will forget."
2,"Prior to this book, I didn't know much about Lance Armstrong. I admire Lance's will to beat cancer and to live; However, he is a selfish and arrogant man and at times I found his attitude distasteful. Having said that, I did find this book enjoyable and learned a little something about cycling. Worth a read."
2,My wife was inspired to candle making after reading this book. You can view her soaps and candles at www homespun-candles-soap .com .
2,"""Lead Crystal set is Gorgeous and Commands Attention. The glassware looks and feels more expensive then it is. A fantastic value in just the glassware alone, but the serving tray is cheap looking and does not match the quality of the crystal. Mine arrived with a major scratch, and a lot of rust like pitting all over it. I did not contact the seller to exchange the tray because even if the tray was perfect, it would still look cheap underneath the glasses. Another Great Amazon Find!!"
2,"Haven't used it too much yet, but as I do have a fascination for dictionaries, mostly about ethymological ones, I am certainly going to, very soon. It is a fac-simile of the 1828 one, and although the language has its XIX century peculiarities, it is not a big an effort to read it."
2,"We are Japanese Americans, and we love using this book to teach our children Japanese. We all know that most children love reading picture books. The drawings in this book are very cute. Kids love reading this book and they think it is a story book. Little do they know that they are actually learning Japanese!!We also like to use this book to teach adult students Japanese. Like the saying ""pictures worth thousand words"", the grown-ups also find the classes interesting when using material like this one.We have got 2 copies and will order more for our students."
2,They are comfy and I am able to wear them for long periods of time where with some other metals I can not. The thing is I have smaller ears than some people so the stones are a little big for my ears I think but other than that they are just fine.
2,I have tried other inks in my EPSON printer with mixed results. EPSON inks & paper is the ONLY stuff I use now. Live & learn.
2,"Although there were serious probblems ordering this tea, it was well worth the wait. Amazon is now able to send all six boxes when you order. The tea is very strong and flavorful. It does make a proper English cup of tea."
2,"Up, Down, Sideways... If you can't find a tune you like on this CD stick a pencil in your head. From Disco to Chill - all with enough latin flavour to clear your sinuses. Sweaty, Sizzling & Sticky... screw the pacemaker, JUST TURN IT UP!"
2,"Very quickly this records sucks you in and takes you... The lyrics are introspective and applicable and the music is BIG. With soaring vocals (suprisingly Leto is very talented on the guitar as well!) you feel as if some of these songs could become the partial soundtrack to your own life. Bottom line: these songs make you FEEL SOMETHING! I've seen them live and it just expounded on the richness and validity of this really great band. You won't regret your purchase... Oh, and it's really sexy, too..."
2,this is a great album but this damn content protected cd will not work on your ipod if you have an ipod buy the digital download its cheaper and least you can hear on the go
2,"I absolutely love this cd.My favorites are The Kill, The Fantasy, Savior, From Yesterday, and Battle of One. Actually, I just love them all.It's very different from their first release, but all 30STM fans should still enjoy it.Go out and buy it!!!"
2,Not as good as their latest album. I enjoyed about half of this CD. Can't explain it. Some of the songs just didn't appeal to me.
2,"...and I have over four thousand. As a player, if I were able to go back in time and jam with a band, this lineup would be one of my top choices. It's the only album I have by Cortijo. I came across it on someone's top ten list when I was searching for salsa, but it's not a salsa album. It is a Latin-funk-jazz odyssey with some of the most incredible chops, rhythms, harmonies, and energy you can ask for in music. There's not a musician on the album who isn't dominating his instrument. If you're lucky enough to have stumbled across this album, you should definitely make it your own!"
2,awesome from beginning to end. Does not need the heavy thinking that some movies try to come up with along the same line. Pure action and fun. Nice to see each actor explore the goofy side of their craft. You go in with little expectation and surprisingly walk away satisfied. Would recommend
2,I loved the TV show and I fully expected this to be a complete abomination as remakes often are. I was pleasantly surprised. They had to change some of the back story but from the beginning to the very end it was a pleasure to watch. The action sequences were throughout and they didn't drown out the comedy which was very important. The cast did justice to the original characters. I have to say my favorite part was right at the beginning when they flew into US airspace. Makes me giggle.
2,"I found this to be Just like the series that I used to watch, and it had a great cast and I would recommend this movie for those that like action."
2,"The movie is a must watch. It has the action, comedy and a little bit of romance. I have seen this movie several times and it still makes me laugh."
2,This film inspired me to speak out in rage due to the fact that this masterpiece has not received the recognition that is due to a production of such immense quality.
2,this was the second pony pal book I read.It was good.lulu finds a pony caught in a fence. but no one is around.her stable hasn't been cleaned.so will the pony survive.I'll let you find out.
2,"Hard to add much to the reviews here. The series deserves more credit than it gets for every aspect of its process and result. So to paraphrase Al, let me again emphasize the pure delight experienced in witnessing such stunningly adept use of the English language -- showstruck fool as I am. If words and naming once held terrifying power, David Milch has gone a long way to restoring their elemental force. At turns ethereal and Shakespearean, at turns brutal and colloquial, ""Deadwood"" speaks in that singular tongue born in and borne by the mouth. Harder then to understand how those who deride the series for its language do not comprehend the fact that, in complete ignorance, they attack its greatest strength. My advice to those few that just don't get it is simple: If you don't have the time to watch, listen."
2,"Again, the title of this review says it all. Too bad HBO didn't do a fourth season!"
2,"I have all three seasons of ""Deadwood"" and love it. This is a very well written and acted series. I wish HBO would have finished the series. It was left hanging at the end of the third season. Still, well worth watching."
2,"HBO in the early 2000s created a Golden Age for Television. One of the shows in this golden age was Deadwood. A Western based on the real town in the Dakotas is a work of art. Based partly on truth and mixed in with fiction, Seth Bullock comes to town to begin a business with his friend Sol Starr. He soon finds himself up against an evil saloon proprietor named Al Swearengen. In this season, Seth finally admits he loves Alma and discovers his wife has come to town at the same time. He devotes himself to his wife and stepson and turns his back on Alma who is now pregnant with his child. Al in the meantime is witnessing the changes in the camp such as the introduction of the telegraph. Other characters are going through changes also. Joanie Stubbs opens her own brothel and Sy Tolliver seems like a constant threat. A very good season of a great TV show. Thank god for what HBO once was."
2,"I loved Petkus' first single CD, ""Moving in Time"", so I wondered if I would be disappointed in this second effort. Happily, I must say that this set equals ""Moving in Time"" in its beauty, quality, and depth. I especially enjoyed Track 1 of the Pitta CD, and the Kapha CD is perfect for unwinding. For those that spend long periods at the computer, the Vata CD is just the thing for keeping you energized and creative!"
2,"Nicely written and truly comprehensive book. Since I'm from Sweden and belong to the Swedish freemasons I could have wished for a chapter about our system also. But on the whole this is a very informative book that I can recommend to both masons and to those who are generally interested in the subject.Jan MalmsjÃ¶, master mason"
2,"This book provides a great amount of information to both those in the Craft and those outside Freemasonry that are interested about the oldest Fraternity in the world.For anyone hoping to have Freemasonry's secrets revealed, don't bother - this book is a legitimate, factual compendium of information about Freemasonry, written by a Mason.You will find some of its history, general symbology, and the organizational structure, but appropriately bereft of any revalations of the particular private things reserved solely for Masons.He covers (debunks) some of the conspiracy theories, and addresses some of the issues and challenges the Fraternity faces."
2,"Was required reading for an intro bio class, but not bad at all. Much better than any textbook. Well researched, and well written."
2,I needed this book for school and its been doing everything you would expect from a book ever since I got it on amazon. Thanks again amazon!
2,"Excellent book, it is like talking to grandpa, you get great advise and good little anticdotes from a long history of golf."
2,"A nice pick-me-up, but not as fun to read as ""Illusions."" Though it is short, it slows a little toward the middle, and not as distinguishable from other books of a similar theme. Worth looking at, but for inspirational reading by Bach, I'd go for ""Illusions."""
2,"This is one book which is highly recommended. A book which is thought to be written for young people is such an inspiring story that its a must read for everyone atleast once.People seeking for meaning of life, would find this the begining and would remember Jonathan rest of their lives."
2,"It had a great moral that anyone could do anything he inspired to, but it took lots of practice and hard work to go to great heights.Jonathan was an inspiration to some of the younger gulls, but others sat on the shore doing nothing. This is a good example of the real world"
2,"Wow, the story was inspirational and seemed to be centered around seeking the truth regardless of the consequences and leading others to the truth once one finds it. The story contains elements of unnoticed ambiguities that will go unnoticed, but the ambiguities are just enough for the reader to put them self in the story without realizing it. If you have a friend read it ask them what they thought about the book and they will get something different out of it."
2,This is a classic story that can inspire you to live a great life. Great for all ages. I really love this book!!!
2,"As an author with my debut novel in its initial release, I am still amazed by the success of Richard Bach's JONATHAN LIVINGSTON SEAGULL. In an era when books are growing increasingly complex and complicated, Bach's book continues to stand out because of its simplicity. Bach spins a tale about a ordinary seagull who finds himself on an extraordinary spiritual journey. This book is a fascinating read, and Russell Munson's photography provides the perfect illustrations for the story. JONATHAN LIVINGSTON SEAGULL remains one of my all-time favorite books."
2,I read this book during my freshmen year in college. This book really give me a positive prospective of my own life. The author illustrations along with the plot of the story provide any reader with a real look at life for individuals from all walks of life. Excellent book to add to any library!
2,"Ancient worlds are revisited in Romans Wore Togas by Fiona MacDonald. Youngsters will smile at the rollicking illustrations of days long past, while they learn what Roman children played with, visit the site of the world's first shopping mall, and see what Emperor Augustus did about high-rise apartments.Published in the Kingfisher series ""I Wonder Why,"" this amazingly complete text leaves little to wonder about as data is skillfully woven into sometimes comically recreated scenes from early everyday life."
2,"I-Way Robbery is an innovative and authoritative guide forprofessionals charged with defending businesses' and governmentagencies' information assests against persons who use the I-Way for criminal, unethical and immoral purposes. Casual and small business users will also be enlightned about some of the dangers they face and what they may do to manage their risks. The authors have carefully identified the most significant problems and issues confronting I-Way users and have provided detailed approaches for their solutions. Emphasis is on ""anticipate and prevent"" and if something happens the readers of this book will be prepared."
2,"A great album of tunes from the middle ages and the Rennaisance performed on various ancient wind instruments and keyboards, with electric accompaniment from Richard Thompson and the Fairport Convention rhythm section. The krumhorns, shawms, virginals ( a lap-held harpsichord), etc. trade melody lines with Thompson's stinging electric guitar while the Fairport crew rock precisely underneath it all. Several beautiful slower pieces appear amidst the foot-stompers, and there are several extended, multi-part suites. Wonderful stuff, recommended to all Fairport Convention and Jethro Tull fans, as well as those interested in early music."
2,"These shoes were an ideal match for a slightly odd-colored skirt I have. The color has worked really well with a lot of my wardrobe. Even though the shoes are patent, the insides are lined with leather - that's really nice! However, I've worn these shoes twice and both times they've rubbed my toes - but not to the point of blisters thankfully. I'm a teacher and spend a LOT of time on my feet. The second wearing was less painful, so hopefully I'll be able to break them in. These shoes will get you lots of compliments! :)"
2,Seeing this dvd is like all the stories my grandfather told me about the six-days is coming back to life. He learned everything there is to know about the six-days and i've assisted to so many six-days here in Europe and i had my own hero: Australia's Danny Clark. I just love the track-races and especially hte madison!!
2,I RECOMEND YOU THE MERCURIO'S CD BECAUSE YOU CAN IDENTIFY SOME MOMENTS OF THE YOU LIVE WITH HIS SONGS AND ENJOY HIS FELLING.
2,"Roger Radford, I have a bone to pick with you... Shame on you, Roger, you have no pity for your readers who are going to become so engrossed in this novel that the world could pass them by. Seriously though, I want to commend you on writing an insightful and thought provoking book. I kept thinking while reading this, ""If only we could get the powers that be to read this"". Your characters are so vivid and real. I felt like I really knew Kieran and felt deep empathy for him. For those of you who have not read it, you have a treat in store. CONGRATULATIONS, Roger, on a beautiful job."
2,I am from Korea. This dictionary was beyond my description. I also recommand a porket dictionay pubished by Cobuild.
2,"This is a gorgeous CD. Ran Blake is one of the most innovative and yet emotionally accessible pianists around. I have nothing bad to say about this music, which was recorded live, before an audience who didn't seem to like it as much as I did, except that it's a gyp - at 38 minutes out of a possible 74 it's much too short."
2,"This book was my introduction to philosophy. And, considering that I still read philosophy constantly, it must have done something right. The Complete Idiot's Guide to Philosophy does a good job of explaining multiple western and eastern philosophies, and is great for the beginner. However, the new-age philosophies detailed in the end chapters are too cultish for the likes of anyone seriously interested in the science."
2,"Nelly's new cd, Nellyville, is the best!! It's even better than his first one. The lyrics are fresh with great beats!! My absolute favorites have to be the tracks..Hot in Herre, Oh Nelly, CG 2, ect...I love the whole cd!! I really think he did a great job on this album and none of you would be dissapointed if you bought the cd!"
2,"Nelly has done it again. Bring another pop-commercial rap cd to the table. Although this cd should have been called COUNTRY GRAMMAR 2:NELLYVILLE. It shows Nelly has skill on the mic whether he raps on a song with N'Sync or Beanie Sigel. Nelly is your all around m.c.. He can get hardcore and soft on the same cd. Even though KRS-ONE will destroyed him in his diss to Nelly Ovah Here. Nelly did say some tight things about him in the remix of Roc The MIc. Overall, this cd should not sell less than 6 million copies because of Nelly's name and he gets airplay on mtv and bet like crazy unlike better m.c.s like Project Pat and Beanie Sigel. But overall impressive second album by Nelly."
2,This was great as a country grammer fan I loved his nellyville and can't wait for the next masterpiece
2,"Honestly, Im not a fan of Nelly's, all because his debut album got on my nerves. Still the first album was good and had some catchy songs. This album isnt any different, its got alot of good songs on it, but it gets annoying after awhile. The really good thing about Nelly is that he keeps the same formula, he doesnt change anything. My favorite songs are: Hot In Herre, Air Force Ones, Dem Boyz, Splurge, Roc Tha Mic (Remix), The Gank, #1 and CG2. I love the song Air Force Ones because the beat was crazy and the rhymes were hot and there my favorite shoes, I got like 10 pairs. All in all this album is pretty good, and even if some of u dont like Nelly, u will love some of his songs, they grow on u."
2,"First of all, Nelly haters need to let Nelly do his thing. He ain't bothering ya'll. I find this album not as good as country grammar. I know it's hard to top a first album that went 8x's platnium. Song I really love on Nellyville are ""Hot in Herre"", the song with Kelly (that is the best), ""Roc the Mic (remix)"", ""Pimp Juice"", and ""Country Grammar 2""."
2,"This is a very good CD. Not as good as his debut album ""Country Grammar"" was. This album almost should be considered an R&B; album not a Rap album. This album lacks the catchy rhymes the songs ""Country Grammar"" and ""E.I."" had in the first album. Those two songs made you want to rap along with Nelly. There aren't many catch rhymes in this album. But ""Nellyville"" has many good songs. ""Nellyville"", ""Hot In Herre"", ""Pimp Juice"", ""Air Force Ones"", ""On The Grind"", ""Dilemma"", ""Splurge"", ""Roc The Mic Remix"", ""CG 2"", and ""Say Now"" are all must listens.I actually look forward to Murphy Lee rapping then Nelly because Lee posesses the catchy rhymes on the album Nelly lacks. His accent makes it enjoyable to listen to him too.Pick up this album, though it may not be great, it's still a good album."
2,"A tantalizing trip through castle Windsor. Listening to Ms. Kelley narrate her book is a real treat. The amount of delicious gossip and factual information keeps one riveted to their headphones. Ms. Kelley delivers each tidbit with conviction and a hint of humor. While some information may be disputed one cannot help but wonder at the outlandish behavior of this blue blood family and how it tries to deal with its problems. Still, it was interesting to know that even the royals are to an extent as common as everyone else and that the highs and lows of life spare no one regardless of birth or position in society. Highly recommended for a fast listen if you can find a copy somewhere. The book contains four cassettes which are rather short in length. I got through the entire book in just one and a half days."
2,"As a (non-anglophile) Canadian who spent summers growing up in England, I really appreciated this sinfully delicious recount of the royal family. My Quebec-born father always abhorred seeing these people depicted on our currency, stamps and even a portrait displayed in a hockey arena and always had some sarcastic comment about them. I wish he was alive to give this a read. This book is packed with the most humourous tidbits that actually make the royals look human. The story about the Duke of Edenburgh smacking the secret service agent with a newspaper during a motorcade and the joke about the Queen, Princess Margaret, the hijackers and the Rolls Royce made me roar with raucious laughter, as did the joke about the cinematographer on page 304. I only wish it had 1000 pages so I could savour it longer. This is the best book I have read since Elroy's American Tabloid! I enthusiastically recommend it! Heidi Howell"
2,"This novel is the fifth in the Inspector John Rebus collection, and is another fine addition to the series. The novel's premise concerns a hotel fire which occurred five years earlier, and the cause and reason have yet to be determined. And, most important, an unidentified corpse was found amid the rubble, and the murder remains unsolved. A local crime boss with connections to loan sharking, the protection rackets, and illegal gambling is the odds on favorite as the culprit, and Inspector Rebus explicates and develops the case in his inexorable fashion. The rather elaborate plot-line is well thought-out and executed, and Rankin treats the reader to a striking and appealing peek at the mean and dirty streets of Edinburgh, Scotland"
2,"I've been borrowing my dad's C7 for 35 years, finally bought my own. His looks exactly the same after 40 and more years of use and nothing cuts like it. I would wait a week to do a project if dad was out of town to use the C7 rather than try another tool."
2,I am always amazed with Taj Mahals music. This cd is one I can listen to over and over. Go to a beach and listen to it on head phones. Wow.
2,This is a good product. It was very easy to assemble even though the instructions were not very clear.Looks sturdy but still not heavy. My 10 year old son is able to move it around easily.
2,"Very easy to assemble, better quality then i was expecting for the price, bought to replace plastic net that couldnt stand up what 7-14 year old boys brought, this one seems much more likely to."
2,"I just picked up this album today and it is outstanding. This, I would argue is Brian's best work ever. He uses live instrumentation on this album which gives it a real musical feel that sets it apart from much of the R&B music that is out there. Howerver, he does not go as far as to try to make a so called ""neo-soul"" record. Just amazing songs with amazing arrangements that use the perfect blend of jazz and contemporary gospel influences.I was a little concered about the use of artists like Nelly on this record, thinking the tracks would be contrived, but Brian does not lose himself even on the records where he does collaborations with other artists. He stays true to form, while giving the album variety.If the other albums did not do it, U Turn truly confirms that Brian is one of the premiere artists in contemporary music. Hats off to him."
2,"If you like the old swing side of the blues, then this is a good album for you. It documents Roomful through the 70s when swing and blues were pretty much underground. The old lineups are good and the arrangements are tight. This collection is supposed to highlight the various frontmen from the early years including Big Joe Turner, Duke Robillard and Eddie ""Cleanhead"" Vinson, but I feel Sugar Ray Norcia and Mac Odum are just as good if not better. What this album does accomplish is showing what a strong horns section Greg Piccolo, Rich Lataille, Bob Enos and Doug James comprised, and why all following arrangements will be less powerful. The albums best tracks are Jumpin' For Joe, That's My Life and Take It Like A Man. Worth owning for the price alone."
2,"It isn't clear why all but one of the reviews is from the 20 year old VHS version. The main criticism was that it was an edited version missing, I suppose, some of the more erotic scenes. Standards have changed a bit since then and what ever eroticism was originally intended was pretty tame and in my view inconsequential to the important dilemmas & conflicts in the storyline . The intrigue within the movie is who is the self serving central male figure going to choose: (a.) the sexually provocative and experienced older female or (b.) the devout innocent younger female. And, what price is he willing to pay for his decision. If you haven't read any hints to the movie then the ending is probably going to be a surprise.A bit dated (clothing styles for each period leave such an indelible image) but the acting, directing, script and cinematography, as the Goya award attests to, carry well into the present."
2,"Trower gives us a hint in the opener ""Whiskey Train"" of what he was later to offer us as a soloist. I think leader Gary Brooker's vocals in this number influenced Trower as to what sort of voice he wanted singing his material--that husky blues voice also made famous by David Clayton Thomas and the late Terry Kath. As a result, the next voice we were to hear a Trower number in was that of James Dewar. Also notable here is ""Whaling Stories"", a lengthy (for its day) prequel to the classic ""Salty Dog""--plus, the sardonic, driving Elton John-ish ""Still There'll Be More"". I think ""Whiskey Train"" is one reason this album is rather undrrated and--at the moment--unavailable in a US issue. It just doesn't sound like a Procol Harum song. What it sounds like is a prelude to the the brilliant Hendrix-esque/ Claptonesque blues-metal career Trower was to have."
2,"nice videos. It is also nice to be able to alternate between 2. The work outs are basic; however, by the time i get to 9 months I may not feel that way. Right now at 5 months they are not hard, but in time I think i will appricate the simple movements with a bigger body."
2,This CD is good stuff. The songs are mixed really well. There are a few songs that really get in your head. There is never a dull moment in this CD if your a fan of trance.
2,"tales of suspense 39-99 where already included in the iron man, so putting in issues 59-99 wasn't very necessary. Anyway, this comes with cap 100-454, v2 1-13, v3 1-50, v4 1-32, and v5 1-12 pretty cool set go ahead and buy it if your a cap fan. The only thing I wish this came with is CAC 1-78 from back in the 40s"
2,"Probably the best hip-hop album I've heard...well, nearly ever. Beats are absolutely amazing. Flow from song to song is great.The only issue I have is, as another reviewer pointed out, the lyrical content is lacking. Then again, you can have fun in music and still churn out something sublime e.g Mozart's 'Magic Flute'.Don't expect a critique of society or life in the ghetto. Expect artists at the peak of their game, creating something that comes across as made more for fun than anything else.If you're anything like me, you'll never tire of this excellent CD."
2,"The best rapper out there making some sci-fi beats. Not much can touch this one. Man, Del can rhyme. Pick this one up and you'll be listening to it all the time. It's one of those CD's that you can listen to all the way through and enjoy every minute of it."
2,"Damn......what an album, the sounds produced by dan the automator are incredible. This album should be a blueprint for MCs of tommorow. Deltron 3030 is a trip, hip hop at his best and also really creative"
2,"I bought this for my wife about 6 months ago. It's perfect for file folders, laptop, and tons of other stuff...and it looks great!"
2,"I purchased this bike about 2 months ago. Unfortunately, I suffered a knee injury and haven't been able to use it as much as I would have liked. It came to me very nicely packaged and all of the hardware was very nicely labeled. It only took my brother and I about an hour to put it together from start to finish. The directions were easy to follow. The bike itself it extremely quiet, no need to turn up the tv while riding. There are great programs to keep your ride enjoyable. The fan doesn't really blow that far to feel any of the air. Like previous reviewers I didn't put the pedal straps onto the bike, which doesn't seem to make much difference. It's very easy to use the computer module and the seat is very comfortable. I thoroughly enjoy it, (as much as I can at this time)."
2,"I enjoyed this book. As I continue on my weight loss journey, I read and re-read the book when I plateau. I appreciated Frances Kuffel's honesty about how obesity had left its marks on her body and that even with the weight loss she will never be body-beautiful. Especially moving was her honesty about how losing weight didn't solve all her problems as so many of we heavyweights believe deep down."
2,"...both physically and emotionally.Yes, the author is hard to like at times, but at least it is honest, rather than asugar-coated version of her personality. Personally, I found her to be a bit harsh at times, but I have never been overweight, so I can't judge her too much.The recollections of her childhood and the period before she started her diet were the most interesting and poignant to me. I think a little something was lost towards the end of the book."
2,"Like the previous critic, I advise the ever-present grain of salt when reading anything that has yet to be proven scientifically. . . Like the wrapping of the water heater has. You WILL save energy and in turn money by doing so. So much to the point that the state of California now provides Water Heater Blankets with installation, free of charge, to anyone that wants one. Soon it will be a requirement."
2,OKAY HOW COOL DO YOU THINK THIS THING COULD BE!!!!!!!IM A BIG FAN OF AVRIL BUT DONT GET ME WRONG THIS DVD IS BETTER THAN THE LET GO CDI LIKE IT WHEN SHE SINGS LIVE!!!!! WHAT SHE DID IN HER CONCERT WAS BRILLIANT!!!!!!! I LOVE THE MY WORLD CD TOOTHE SONGS ARE SOOOO AWESOME!!!!!!!!FUEL- A SONG FROM METALLICAOFCOURSE THIS THING IS ROCK!!! ONE OF MY FAVORITE!!!!!!ROCK ON AVRIL!!!!!!!ROCK ON!!!!ROCK ON!!!!I KNOW SOMEDAY YOU COULD BE OUR ROCK QUEEN!!!!!!!!!!
2,I thoroughly enjoyed her DVD 'My World'. Avril is very talented for her age. I have a lot of admiration and respect for her. Go Avril! I'm looking forward to receiving her latest CD/DVD limited edition combo 'The Best Damn Thing':The Best Damn Thing (CD/DVD Deluxe Limited Edition)
2,"I was hunting on the Internet for Svend Asmussen, one of the best swing fiddle players and discovered him as a member of the Swe-Danes. This remarkable CD is streamed on Rhapsody and I came here hoping to buy it. It consists of a mix of vocalese reminiscent of Lambert, Hendricks and Ross where the vocalists make instrument sounds. It has in addition harmonies between fiddle and voice and other things I have never heard anywhere else. It is more of the bouncy Scandinavian feel than LHR, not bebop, but flawlessly executed. If you like swing and close harmony don't miss this CD. I have never heard anything like it and it is most enjoyable."
2,I don't know why these pillow cases are not being made anymore. I have had these for many years but they have now become thread-bare from being so old and the many washings they've gone through. They have lasted very long and are the softest cases I've ever used!! If anyone owns these and has found something comparable to these please let me know...Can't find these ANYWHERE :(
2,"This was very, VERY helpful in dealing with my aging stepmother. She is often living in the past, and this book has provided good ideas and strategies for managing the situation as well as possible. Also, I feel much better knowing that my actions are appropriate."
2,I haven't used this in the field yet but it seems to have everything I need for my Mt.Rainier expedition next month. The product is extremely light and is definitely water proof. I look forward to using it.
2,I love the Pony Pals books and I like the second one the sequel A Pony For Keeps!It is a cool book.
2,"I think Anna is a really smart girl. She knows that ponies can't be allowed to do just what they want to do, the rider is in charge! That way the pony (or horse) and rider will get along. My cousin and I live on farms with ponies (and horses...there is a difference!) and, just like Anna, we know that the pony must be kept under control. Otherwise it's no fun! I just want to ask something. My cousin has two Shetland ponies who are really small-and full grown! We're both nine years old and I'm starting to out-grow Mona, my welsh pony. So how can the Pony Pals still be perfect for their ponies? Especially Anna? All in all, a great book!"
2,"The Style Council is noted as Paul Weller's low period. I think this period in his career is just as high as Smithers Jones or anything from his ""solo"" period during the decade of the 1990s.Some of the lyrics can get a little silly and overwrought at times but in all TSC was a great band headed by Paul Weller. Mostly I love the varied dance/cafe/funk explorations.If you are a music fan you should not go long without hearing some of the best that The Style Council has to offer..."
2,"This documentary is well done, informative, and contains many beautiful moments and many humorous ones too. My partner and I both have ADD, and we were constantly looking at each other and saying ""yes, that describes me"" or ""yes, I've gone through that"". I highly recommend this for anyone who has ADD or thinks they might."
2,"I was fortunate enough to have been given a copy of this book, and the accompanying 33rpm record for my 6th birthday. It was to turn out as one of the 'Landmarks"" in my reference to life. Almost half a century later, I use the stories for the Grandkids, and as a reminder: He who takes the cakes That the Parsee man makes, Makes dreadful mistakes! It is not possible to recommend this book as a higher value, with the obvious exception of The Holy Bible."
2,"The first time we got this from the library, I was expecting it to be just for the kids. I was surprised to find my husband and myself enjoying it just as much as they did! We just purchased it for our girls for Christmas, and they have been listening to it constantly for the last week! Some audio books you listen to a couple times, and that's it, but this is something that is fun to for them to listen to over and over. Kipling was an excellent writter, and his stories are filled with great descriptions and lots of good vocabulary that you don't find in most children's books. The Just So Stories are rich entertainment for young minds - and older ones, too!"
2,"You know that ""truth is stranger than fiction"" because fiction is limited by our imagination. Here, author Epstein, provides a captivating biography of Armand Hammer - a con's con. Hammer pulled ""all the stops"" in a brazen existence of deception that is way beyond what can be imagined by all but the most cunning connivers. Crossing even blood and family members, Epstein's true chronicle of Hammer far surpasses anything of the mass media fictional yarns or true, related stories of the same ilk. Exceptionally well-written and very difficult to put down: most readers will find Hammer's m.o. incredulous and not being able to wait to see what happens next. In short, a great biography and required reading for sensitizing to business hypocrisy."
2,"Mr. Epstein places a great work on to the life of Armand Hammer. Many individuals wonder how such a man, whom was red flagged by the CIA, could remain connected to each and every Presidential administration and Kremlin since the days of Lenin. I was hoping for more information on their dealings with Robert Maxwell but it was only mentioned in brief. Hammer, like is father, presented to the public as immensely wealthy and powerful individuals, yet reality had dictated the opposite. Hammer, a man in quest for power, could have taken the time to do good things but instead he worked to expand not only his own personal image/power but to keep the secret line open to advance the Communist movement. I'd also recommend ""The Perestroika Deception"" - A. Golitsyn."
2,Great gift for child! Delivery was fast as well!! My son plays with it alongside his other farm equipment toys but prefers this one the most. Seems to be durable.
2,The Germans make a good product. My grandsons take this unit out as soon as they arrive. Well worth the relatively high price. Lots of details.
2,A ver good action Seagal movie/films. A recommendation for those whom are interested in this genre of movie/films. The very first action tutle from Seagal.
2,"Great score, great story, great action. This is Seagals best film next to Under Seige. Too bad he fizzeled out after a coupla good ones. Charles Bronson remains King of the genre. Check out The Mechanic and Death Wish 2 and 4...."
2,"This is the third single 'Freaky Time' from the latest boy band Point Break from UK. This song (original mix) was taken from the Apocadelic album not including the other two single songs Radio Mix and Unplugged Version. The songs are quite good actually. So, take a chance to hear it anytime."
2,It is what it looks like. A big truck with a moveable backhoe and front loader. It's light weight and is plastic so it doesnt have any metal corners to worry about. My 2 year old brings it to bed.
2,This backhoe was a perfect gift for a young boy who loves anything with a motor in it. My sister says he loves it and it looks like it was made to last.
2,"I'd like to get my hands on several of these pieces but they're hard to find. I'm a professional trumpet player, but I think most people would enjoy these highly accessible works. The McKinley is a fun piece if you have a bassoonist and the Gould is a gem. My personal fave is the Carbon for sheer originality and beauty of melody and harmony. Actually, they're all good pieces. Give this one a try!"
2,"I was given this book by someone who knows I have read Churchill with satisfaction before. This book was captivating, fascinating, and left me acutely aware of the author's deeply thoughtful reflections on Christianity as a viable way of life. The fact that many of the hurdles faced by today's church are the same as those facing the characters of the book struck me, as did the fact that some of the problems addressed have taken turns unanticipated by the author. At times I deeply agreed and at other times was astounded and saddenened at the direction taken and conclusions drawn. God is still in control, regardless. This book made me reflect on aspects of my own life which need to be re-evaluated."
2,"I love this show, I love this show, I love this show. I love John Simm. I love Philip Glenister. I realize this may not be helpful but I've NEVER written a review for anything before so that may convey just how much I (wait for it) love this show.This is so not the American version."
2,"My wife and I both wear this. It fits comfortably and the gel stuff works! I wish it had lumbar support, came in other colors and was lighter, but excellent quality overall and a good value."
2,i think that it was a very sweet song and it gave a lot of meanning to the words love and care.
2,"I read this particular number of the Hardy Boys series only after reaching middle age. I read many as a young boy, but most of the earliest #3 through #8, I have only read since finding the Applewood reproductions.All these books are good, allowing they're for boys. The ice skating scenes were realistic and got me involved. The little house falling over the hillside I found hard to understand, as the boys cooked something on the stove after that. I assume it's a type of structure or something 1920's that I might not understand. Riding the train into Chicago was true to life for a small town boy, also the snow storms in Montana, are written by someone who had experienced them, or better had a strong imaginative understanding of situations. A good writer.I wish these stories would be made into movies, not for special effect, for humor, or updated, but just as is, with actors who take the characters and situations seriously."
2,"A good book to use as a starting point in the building of costumes. It gives great detail on how create masks, millinary, drafting a pattern, radiating a pattern and so on. Gives a good basic idea of the styles for specific periods and the names of the different pieces. The historical accuracy is also very good too. Nice variations on how to give a different shape to sleeves, and hems and decorative borders that are accurate for the period. I have created sucessfully the early 16th and 17th century costumes as well as early mantles. Sizing is not always true to modern sizes and some adjusting may be neccessary. I really enjoy this book and it is often the first place I look in getting ideas for a new costume.Stephanie Carrig"
2,"Really love this product. I use if after every bath on my arms and legs. It goes on wet, but dries in minutes and makes my skin feel nice and smooth. I really can recommend this product."
2,"If you are a ship expert, or just want to find a little information, this is for you. Braynard and Miller did a spectacular job! They wrote enough info. so you know and understand each ship, but aren't so detailed that the book bores the reader. This book is a must have for anyone interested in ocean liners."
2,I purchased this sewing machine based on the price and positive reviews. I had very little sewing experience so I needded something that wouldn't make it frustrating. This was a good machine to start with as it has the basic stitching functions that you will use when starting out. The instructions booklet was also very good and was my constant companion when I first started. I was surprised at how many accessories came with it and I couldn't imagine it being any easier to thread a machine. Each step is numbered with directional arrows so even if you didn't have instructions you could do it. I would highly recommend this machine if you are a beginner. It easy to use and doesn't take each much space at all.
2,"I read this book a few years ago and can't forget how much I adored it! It doesn't sound like a real exciting book, but I couldn't put it down! I was just like Sally and I could really communicate with her character. I used to daydream exactly like she did and in fact I still do. I will continue to cherish this book. I recommend it to so many people!"
2,"Este libro me entretuvo y me brindo una lectura placentera. Por momentos tambien me hizo reir porque si bien la historia es un drama, la escritora la narra con cierto humor en algunas partes. Lo unico que no me gusto mucho fue el final porque no se sabe a ciencia cierta que fue del destino de la protagonista. Eso quedo librado a la imaginacion del lector. De todas formas, es un lindo libro."
2,"This book certainly has more prose than necessary, but the recipes are the important part - and these recipes are great. If you are looking for simple, rustic, italian recipes, there are plenty of other books to chose from. This author, however, provides the best collection of recipes that goes beyond the basics, providing the reader with meals you won't see anywhere. The recipe for chestnut flour-ricotta gnocchi are a good example."
2,It was shipped in a vary timely manner. I was unable to use and had to return but would buy from this supplier again.
2,"I bought a Canon 5D and love the camera but HATED the time it took to download photos to my Mac laptop. I read about this resource on a digital photography discussion group and thought this was just what I was looking for. I was right.If you have high-speed and high-capacity CF cards, and can use this product, you will not be disappointed.I was up and running with it in a few minutes.This has made using my digital SLR a real joy. Highly recommended!"
2,"Keith Jarrett never stops. He always experiments, he is always in search...Here`s what he has found :)"
2,"My girls love to play with their play kitchen and to cook and bake! Santa brought this set of cupcakes and they are great. They are shape sorters, and yummy cupcakes! They fit perfect into their play oven. These are also made from quality materials."
2,"My niece loves these, a great addition to her llittle kitchen. It is a toy she can grow in to as she learnsher shapes & how to put things together. The shapes are everywhere - on the cupcake pan, the bottom ofthe liners, the cupcakes - all fit together! Nice sturdy materials, not flimsy or cheap feeling. She will have manyyears of baking cupcakes for all of us..."
2,"When I read the back cover comment from Seth Godin, I was intrigued because I am a person who will tell someone how to build a watch when they ask me what time it is. Still, I questioned whether a self-employed private investigator could really employ methods developed for professional consultants. I found that I can, because I face the same challenges that any other business owner faces: sluggish or erratic growth; fierce competition; newcomers who are willing to undercut rates to astonishing levels; and clients who are in turn open to marketing or completely fed up with being targeted. The techniques put forth in this book are helping me to develop a unique approach that I am confident will, at the very least, win me an initial interview with a prospective client because I will not be seen as the ""same old same old."""
2,"I am SO pleased to have found Gorky Park's CD! After a friend introduced me to Gorky Park's album 8 years ago, I have been searching ever since. Absolutely the BEST hard rock I've ever heard out of Russia. This album has a very definite Russian flavor mixed within the rock.. a REAL treat! And very rare! Too bad there aren't 6, 8 or 10 stars to affix to this one! You owe it to yourself - Get It!"
2,"Having purchased these storage containers previously, I know how durable they are. Rubbermaid hit the nail on the head with this product, especially for those of us with very limited storage space. They collapse to 1/4 their full height, are dishwasher, microwave, & freezer safe. They can also be expanded a little or alot, depending on how much food is going into them. The material washes up completely with the exception of tomato based sauces; that tends to discolor the plastic for awhile. I have never been happier with a line of storage containers than when Rubbermaid introduced these; now I am on a mission to find the few remaining as this line has been discontinued...why, I ask?"
2,Love this product! Bought more. Keeps my salad fresh and crisp for days!Delivery was quick. They take a little getting used to closing around the edge rather than pressing straight down but quite easy.
2,"I've been using the reusable k-cup every day since Christmas. Unlike some reviewers here I use it with the Mr Coffee Keurig Brewer since I do not own the Keurig coffee brewer. The reusable filter is easy to use. I have not experienced splashing like others have mentioned. I did notice a stronger cup with using fine grain coffee. I had trouble finding fine grain coffee or espresso for a decent price, but finally found Cafe Bustelo. It's a good quality, fine grain espresso for a cheap price! Check the reviews & you'll see it has between 4 1/2 to 5 star review average. I highly recommend it."
2,"Ok after reading several other reviews we have fixed the problem.....the problem lies with the top seal or lack there of. After putting lots of thought while drinking wine it came to us....use a rubber wine cork! First carefully slide the rubber plunger off from around the needle, second cut a thin slice of rubber cork about 1/8 inch. If you used a cork screw to open it you should have a hole already in the middle. Slide it over the needle than replace the rubber stopper. To make it stronger you need to slow it down so we used the plastic cup from a used kcup. Remove everything from the inside of the cup and cut the plastic lip off. Slide it inside the reusable kcup then insert removable filter and your beans......done!"
2,"This filter pays for itself right away if you drink alot of coffee, but it makes a much weaker, less flavorful cup of coffee than the k-cups do. Still a good purchase overall."
2,Awesome little product and such a great idea! This is a killer price compared to the stores...thinking of buying a few more!
2,"This is an indespensible option for your Keurig brewer. Without it, you will be forced to drink whatever K-cup coffee is available. With it, you can use your preferred coffee and brew it to your preferred strength. Get it."
2,"It is a great little gadget and if you want to make ""real"" coffee with your kuerig you will need it. I haven't seen any better alteernatives. The problem I have had is that the plastic containers chip and need to be replaced. Also the price seems high to me for this type of an item. Buy a couple-it is easier to have a couple going if you drink multiple cups."
2,This is fantastic! I sometimes buy the k-cups but I use this for everyday. I have not experienced any of the issues mentioned and have had complete success with mine! Love it!
2,I brought this item for my mother and she was excited to use it on her coffee machine Keurig. Every time I go to the store this item was always sold out and I find it here. Very affordable to have because a box of cofee singles are $12 and over.Is very economical for putting your own favorite cofee into the filter. Worth buying!
2,I bought one of these when I purchased my B-40 elite. With the first use water and coffee grounds spilled out of the top and sides of the filter and holder and produced a weak cup of coffee full of grounds. I was going to return it but decided to call customer service and they told me to pull the rubber gasket that surrounds the needle on top down about halfway to help create a tighter seal. Tried that and it helped keep the water from spilling out all over the place but I still had a very weak cup of coffee. I read on a post somewhere to buy a 1/2L flat rubber washer from the hardware store and put it in the indentation on the top of the lid of the K-cup. It fits and works pefectly! You can't imagine how happy I was to see that nice dark liquid pouring out of the brewer and into my coffee cup! I just bought two more (just the inner baskets) so that I can always have one clean and ready to fill with my Peet's coffee.
2,I love my Keurig but not the cost or waste of the K-cups on a daily basis. I use these Reusable Filters all the time and keep the K-cups for company/house guests or special flavors.Dumping the used grounds works best if you tap the filter upside down against the hard side of a container. Then I rinse the remainder out and air dry. The screens do sometimes tear where they are attached to the frame (this was a replacement) but I use them daily and they last several years as long as they are not treated roughly.
2,"I bought two - gifted one and kept the other. I am not a coffee person so I haven't used mine yet, but will when my mother comes for a visit It arrived on time and in good condition and the price was better than any other i found."
2,"It works great!I use an espresso (fine) grind. You just have to experiment with it. With the espresso grind, i find that i needed about 7 grams of coffee for a good cup. If you fill it to the top, the pump of the machine isn't strong enough to push it through.Just need to experiment with the amount of grinds you use. But definately needs a fine grind."
2,"My granddaughter loves to play doctor, she is always checking my blood pressure, heart, etc. This set is very nice and will make her very happy."
2,I am so happy that I found this set on Amazon. It cost a little more than double the price on other websites. This doctor kit is worth the price that I paid for it. All the pieces are nice thick plastic for long lasting play. Thank you Learning Resources for putting batteries in some of the items. My children love playing doctor even more now that they have the same tools that doctors use. All I need to find now is the doctor coats for little ones.
2,"My son started showing an intrest in creative play, so we purchased this dr's kit for his 2nd birthday. It was most certainly a hit! He loves to open and shut the kit, put on the glasses and name tag and play with all the instruments; using them on his dressing dog. It's precious to watch him open the dog's vest and use the stethoscope appropriately. The heartbeat/cough is the coolest feature in my opinion!I also wanted to say that I attribute this set with a wonderful visit to our ped. I was so scared of how this 2 year old visit to the doc would go, but he was completely comfortable and even laughing throughout the visit. (yea!!!) I attribute it to his role-playing at home with this kit as all the instruments are life like."
2,"I have purchased other doctor sets for my little girl and this is one of the best! I am a teacher and I love Learning Resources products. They are very durable, fun and educational at the same time. The phone, beeper and stethoscope work great and when my daughter puts on the glasses (that actually fit) she's adorable!"
2,The only problem with these is they are solid colors.. The picture shows white flecks that make it look more like ice cream but they are really solid colors and don't look as real as the picture..
2,"To start I'd have to say, I could not wait to see this movie, after only hearing the soundtrack before the movie was released. It just really got me pumped to see it.Given it had a cheesey moment here and there, and the ending was a bit confusing for me would justify a 4 star rating. But, I still absolutely enjoyed it. The action was precise, loud, and in your face. Just the way it should be.Now after reading all the reviews of you people totally picking this movie apart. Don't you have anything better to do? You just got to sit back, relax, and enjoy the movie for what it is. Because no matter how much you complain, you cannot change it.So don't pay attention to their reviews, see it, and form your own. Blade Trinity is far from disappointing."
2,Good product overall. Wanted to split video from my ten year old dell to my new hdtv. This did the job.
2,It continues after the ending of the Dragon Reborn and goes strong. It's fun to read and keeps me interested. I'm about half-way through and I'm loving the way the characters and their world is developing. I found I could relate to Mat the most out of them all.
2,"I love this volume, because this is where all if the main character's stories finally take off. Each of them are set on the beginning of their path that they will follow through until the last battle. Granted, this is not the beginning of the story. Before now, things have been happening to the heroes without any real decision on their part. They've been mostly wanting to go home, but now they finally accept that they can never really ""go home"". I love it!"
2,"The series is great, but this book is lacking something, ah yes, a good main character. After Rand being almost completely cut out of third book, he is reintroduced but lacks the appeal the pre-Dragon Reborn Rand had. He has become a cackling madman, who no longer needs to be the center of the story.But what saves this book is the character sub-plots, and new and old characters. What saddens me though is that at the end the sub-plots did not ravel together for a spectacular finale, as did the first three. And Nynaeve is becoming feminism personified. She was my favorite before she met the Aes Sedai and began her transformation in personality. Jordan you need to tone her down a bit!Overall a great book, and everyone needs to read it."
2,I ripped through the series as fast as I could. I could not read the pages fast enough.
2,purchase experience was very good. Delivery was fast and product exactly what I ordered.
2,"Todo ha sido excelente, la entrega fue en el lapso indicado, y la calidad de las baterias es buena. Recomiendo al vendedor en un 100%. Gracias"
2,"While the product description states this battery is ""Compatible with Motorola T5320, T5400, T5420, T5600, T5620, T5700, T5720, T5800, and T5820 2-way radios"" the 53615 is compatible with many more.

2,"As soon as I have found the missing cookies that my 2 1/2 year old has tossed throughout my house, he carryies them off and loses them all over again. He doesn't show much interest when I try to count the candies or the cookies. Maybe he will get interested in that at a later date, but for now, he just wants to toss them around the house. Very adorable jar and cookies though. Overall, I'm still happy I purchased them."
2,"My son loves this simple toy so much! He carries the jar around and loves dumping them out and counting and stacking the cookies. They are fun, educational and a great value!"
2,"Five records I've loved this year:Cat Power - You Are FreeNew Pornographers - Electric VersionGrandaddy - SumdayCalexico - Feast and WireRadiohead - Hail to the Thief""Yoko"" by Beulah is better than all of them. Seriously, it's the best record of the year, no contest. It's a cohesive, challenging, and ultimately confident artistic achievment. There's not one stinker on the entire album. Even Radiohead has songs that I have to skip past on each of their albums. This is not the case with the new Beulah record."
2,This product is the best. Metra is the only company that makes this product and it actually fits properly. It is a must buy over any other.
2,"Even though it's 2005 and this movie is very old, it's still great. I saw this 2 days ago because my parents bought it for me because we couldn't rent it anywhere. We got it for $3.99. It's a very good movie. The animation is poor by today's standards but it's so good! There is one part that is not for children at all! You soon begin to feel sorry for these dogs and The Tod will keep you guessing. But, the end sucks because it never shows if they live or die. They're just swimming when it ends. Minus those couple parts, it's a great video but parents, please watch it first!"
2,"I can understand people having problems with Callas' studio-Aida because it truly was recorded too late and might be problematic to some. But I cannot hear ONE vocal flaw here. And her sound is free of the beat and vibrato of the later years. But this is a review-page. If you wish to discuss it, lets do so on Opera-L or another operaforum."
2,This is a great comedy/drama about 2 lady truckers struggling to make a go of it against all odds.It's a must see!!
2,"I have always been undecided on how I feel about Obie Trice. The only Obie tracks that I have listened to extensively are the songs on DJ Greenlantern's ""Conspiracy"", and even then, they weren't his songs, just his collaborations. I honestly just bought the CD for ""Got Some Teeth"", but to my great surprise, the entire disc ended up being great. To the trained ear, it is apparent that Eminem did have a lot of influence on the production, however, this comes as no real surprise. Song's like ""Lady"", ""The Set Up"", ""Hoodrats"" and ""Oh!"" highlight the album. Of course, the underground hit ""We All Die One Day"" makes for a good ""Ghetto Anthem"". I am not disappointed at all in Obie Trice's first solo album, but there is room for improvment. By the time Obie is ready for a sophomore release, I'm sure all of the kinks will be worked out."
2,"Obie Trice really stun me with this album. It was acually good. He was spittin on this album with fire. The production was decent but it matched his flow and style. It was shockingly cohesive. I expected another D12 album but this was really good. Should had sold better. Hopefully his next album would be just as good.Top 3 Songs: Ooh, The Set-Up, Average ManBottom 3 Songs: Got Some Teeth, Follow My Life, Look in my EyesSleppers: Neva Forget Ya, Hands on You"
2,"This is superb and a great way to group some of the best Lifehouse songs, even without The Who. Townshend's vocals are great and so are most of the remixes. The only disapointment is the rap bridge in the middle of ""Who Are You."" If you are looking for some classic songs with a lot of change, mostly for the better, than this is the CD you want!"
2,"This 1968 album is a blues classic. Her voice can only be matched by the legendary Bessie Smith.Her original version of Ball N Chain is a million times better then Janis Joplins, and I'm a Hugh Joplin fan. This is her second version of Hound Dog and it rocks. Sadly I feel she is a forgotten legend."
2,"yes i might be a little crazy to compare orlando to the greek figure tiresias but i have to be honest. orlando is virginia wolfes verison of tiresias in some form. i love this movie and the actors that performed their parts. the music is good and the time jump from elizabeth the first to the modern day is well done. i recommed this gender-bending movie,because its spell casting and the story of searching for your own happiness is that good too."
2,"The book starts out with a dedication to the NYC sanitation department. How often does that happen?The whole length of the book is a garbage truck describing his day (our night, of course). Hence the line ""Did I wake you? Well, TOO BAD."" (I love that line. It's so true to life! Our garbage trucks always wake us here.)This truck roars, burps, and is proud of his recipe for Alphabet Soup (including such delicacies as Dirty Diapers and Puppy Poo, not to mention Zipped up Ziti with Zucchini). And I love the pride with which our narrator declares that he stinks - but he's got an important job. Without him, as he ways, we're on ""Mount Trash-o-rama, baby"".I can't say enough good things about this book. Definitely check it out."
2,"It's a great book! I bought this for my grandson, to go along with his new Trash Truck toy that he received."
2,"We checked this out from our local library. My six-year-old son loved it so much, he wants to get it for his cousin. Throw in a toy trash truck and you have an awesome present.The book is best when read with emotion. Make the noises the truck makes and you are in for an evening of laughs. What a great way to end the day.Your boys and girls are sure to love this one."
2,"Rated 5 stars for content, the intros are a bit scratched but the transfer of the shows look much better than I remember the last time I caught a rerun. And the original intro theme song plays in all its glory before every episode. Oh, yeah.This classic series is on the surface a reversal of the Beverly Hillbillies scenario, but at heart it is much more -- an exhilarating expedition into existentialistic absurdity via la theatre de l'absurde. Eat your heart out, Moliere!"
2,Perfect for my carnival party. Used wooden cookie sticks to give them a vintage look. Make sure you purchase the right size sticks.
2,We made chocolate pops for my daughters baby shower the details in the molds showed and they released easy great fun to make
2,"W.B Yeats while known best for his poetry wrote Mythologies a wonderfully subtle and atmospheric collection ofshort stories set in Ireland featuring ghost, faeries, and the like. While not graphically horrific by modernstandards, Mythologies captures the soft unexplainable moments that hover over rational human existence...the door down the hall that closes itself, the stranger on the road that never existed, the premonition thatleads to surreal encounter, the power of love to transcend mortality. This is the stuff of Mythologies. Greatlittle book on ghosts and other things that go bump in the night."
2,"I just love the CD with a passion. Every single song on the album are great. No fillers. The beats are ultra phat. I recommend this album to anybody who loves great classic Hip hop albums like Common's ""Like Water for Chocolate"" and Mos Def's ""Black on both sides"". One of the best albums this year"
2,"I first saw this movie, when I was 18 years old, with my mother. I have always been a classic movie buff, specifically musicals. I remember watching the movie and crying through a lot of it with my mom. I always wanted my husband-to-be a classic movie buff, as well. On Christmas Eve 1997, the movie came on and I asked him if he would watch it with me. To my shock, he did and he loved it. That was when I knew I had found my husband. It is my all time favorite movie ever and I am now 25. I will always love this movie and take it everywhere I go."
2,This is an all time classic movie! Anyone who is a Gary Grant fan...should add this dvd to their collection!A beautiful love story!
2,"A loevly collection, with very good selections, being recorded specially for the collection at sites. Gnawa Music, Pakistan, Iran and Yemen CDs are my favourites, but I love the entire colection. This is a one that every lover of the music have to hear."
2,"When I first came across Battlelore, I bought this album because the artwork looked cool and I thought it might sound interesting. This band is indeed surprisingly good, I liked everything from the heavy guitar riffs, to the male death vocals and clean female vocals. What I also like, is that this band is heavly influenced by J.R.R. Tolkein's ""The Lord of The Rings"" trilogy, and base most of their songs on that story. But, they aren't one of those bands that do such things just to gain popularity, they actually love Tolkein's writing, and put a lot of emotion and quality in their songs to display their affection for the great writer. This band is great and highly recommended for fans of Lacuna Coil, Ashes You Leave, etc.."
2,"Just finished reading such an inspiring book by Wally Amos. My husband and I have been self employed since we have been married (32 years now). I so thoroughly connected with the wonderful advice Wally spoke of. His personality reminded me so much of my husbands who also is a great one for turning lemons into lemonade. After visiting the ""chip and cookie"" website I must say Geez I know Christine must be a loving and strong women in her own right. It just would have been nice had she also been African American"
2,"The Book Do You the Monkey Man was the best book I have ever read. This book is a very suspenseful book, it also kept me reading on. Once I got finished reading this book I was very shocked by what had happened. Sam's always wondered where her dad and sister are. Once you red this book you will find out everything. This book was a very good book to read. I would recommend it to all adults and teens. The author uses many deatils in this book to show you everythintg that has happened.Once you read this book you will not put it down. The whole book is shocking from the beginning to the end."
2,"Don't jump on the Anti-Movie bandwagon! Give this soundtrack a fair chance. The sound is amazing in it's remastered glory and some songs (ie: I'm Free, Fiddle About, Eyesight to the Blind, Acid Queen) actually sound better on this CD than they do on the original Who album.The new songs written for the movie (Bernie's Holiday Camp, Champagne, and Mother and Son) fit in nicely. Bernie's Holiday Camp is a personal favorite of mine. The song is campy and, more importantly, establishes the relationships between the boyfriend, Tommy, and the mother.My only complaint is that some songs are missing instrumental breaks. Bernie's Holiday Camp, Eyesight to the Blind, and Acid Queen are all missing at least a minute or two of instrumental. The album is re-edited nicely so the untrained listener does not notice.The soundtrack's not flawless, but is by no means bad."
2,"This really should be a 5-star rating, except those other reviewers are right - the quality is not great. But that's not the point! The music is really great, and I love it. They have funny songs, sad songs, jumpy songs and slow songs. The voices are good, the melodies are good, the lyrics are good. It's true there are 28 songs yet the running time is not long, as all the songs are short, but hasn't anyone heard the phrase 'short and sweet'? If you don't want to risk the bad qualaty and sound of this album, fine, don't get it, but I really recommend it for its music."
2,"Dr. Kisamore wrote a masterpiece. A wonderful and tragic story that allows you to become part of it. The story begins with a brief history of the Kisamore legacy and ends with the sacrifice and glory of a young warrior and hero. Dr. Kisamore masterfully brings the reader into the story. After reading the book, I felt like I had lost a friend and Big Brother. Thank you Dr. ""K"" for allowing me to get to know "" Leo, Your Big Brother""."
2,I really enjoyed reading this book and the wonderful art work that goes on and on...it is just fantastic! I will enjoy rereading and reviewing the artwork. It is not only very inspiring but very informative. Douglas presents himself as an example one can take in their spiritual journey to enlightenment. It is a timeless addition to my New Age collection.
2,"You won't find paintings like this just anywhere! I wouldn't mind living inside some of these--such beautiful fantasy worlds! Yet are they really fantasy? Taylor's words also inspire, and encourage. If he can do this, he seems to be saying, so can we. With so much ugliness in the world, these beautiful works of art remind us that we don't need to dwell in darkness. Through our minds, we can open ourselves into higher realms of light, beauty, and truth. A wonderful gift book! Especially if you or your loved one enjoy the extraterrestrial adventure story . . ."
2,"Tabernacle of Hate by Kerry Noble is the definitive work about the Christian right wing extremist movement in the US and Canada today. Noble imparts an understandable and pointed look inside the extremist-religionist mentality in the US and even insight into the fanatic religionist movement around the world.Tabernacle of Hate is must reading for politicians, political scientists, psychologists, sociologists and anyone who cares about fanaticism in action and its effects on the very foundations of the nation. The book is well written by Noble and very well edited by Sean Fordyce. It should be the basis for documentaries and even a feature film. It is worthy of the attention of Speilberg. Only a film maker of that caliber can do justice to the importance and ramifications of the revelations of Kerry Noble."
2,"This is a good book. The pictures are totally far-out, and the lyrics are nice for those of us who ocassionally need help with the words to a song. I'd recomend this book if you're looking for an interesting read."
2,"is proportional to the music that you make. (! ) One word: fabuloso. If you ever wondered what, say is behind ""polythene pam"" or had an urge to sing along with john on ""i am the walrus"" or ""happiness is a warm gun"", this'll be a fun collection. The art is great...Dr Roberts, por ehemplay, is indeed a sight. And who wouldn't be awaken by the scene in ""Good Morning""? Be forwarned that most of these pics and scenarios were done in the 60's and they have that 60's pop-art flair to 'em... I easily can see someone doing the same kinda treatment for Elton John's or Pete Townsend's or TAFKAprince's catalog. One could only imagine the graphics for Tafkap's ""billie jean b*"" or ""lady cab driver...."""
2,"The Herd enjoyed exactly three UK hits, and they are all here in magnificent stereo sound. ""From the Underworld"", ""Paradise Lost"", and ""I Don't Want our loving to Die"" all hit the UK Top 20, the latter made it to No. 4. Unfortunately, the band chose to start writing its own A-sides, and that's where they went wrong. Of the other material here, there is frankly little to recommend. ""The Game"", recorded after Frampton bailed out, is a noble attempt at a commercial record, but its B-side, ""Beauty Queen"" is actually better. ""Diary of a Narcissist"" is amusing enough, but much of their other recordings pale in comparision to the hits. If you love late '60s UK commercial pop, get this CD for them."
2,This was one of the first war movies I ever saw. It blew me away. James Garner is the MAN. A must see movie. What makes this so interesting is the fact that it is true. Worth you time and money. An absolute classic.
2,I too prefer a letterbox (widescreen) transfer over a full screen one because the letterbox format is the way you see the movie in a theater. However unlike the widescreen movies of the 50's & 60's you don't lose any picture for fullscreen versions of recent (70's & after) movies. For the older movies they had to pan & scan the image to fit the screen and you lost part of the picture that way so you buy the letterbox version to get the full image. But today they just open up the matte meaning you see stuff at the top & bottom that you didn't see in the theater. Sure I bought this full screen disc. It was agood way to get two great movies for the one low price. Not all double movie (2 on one disc) sets are full screen. I've bought some (like The Fugitive/US Marshalls) where both movies were in letterbox format. Oh & for these sets they are flipper discs meaning one movie per side of the disc. A great way to get a pair of movies!!
2,"Finishing the story of the Gellert brothers begun in ""The Reformer"", the book develops the character of Verice Demansk, the father of Adrian Gellert's lover and commander of the opposing Vanbert army. Gellert is guided by ""Center"", a computer, and the disembodied Raj Whitehall, a general from another time and planet. The introduction of technology by Adrian brings victories, but the end results depend on man's strengths and weaknesses. Eric Flint and David Drake succeed in closing a story begun by Drake and S. M. Stirling, and the transition is very well done. Another fine novel of military SF by this pair."
2,"I have started reading the book and have only just completed the first chapter. From what I can judge so far, it is a very detailed study of the Shikoku pilgrimage, its historical evoulution and its significance from religious and cultural aspects. The text is very well written and I have found the narration very interesting even though this book or its subject would not arouse much enthusiam among many if judged only by its title. The authour is commended for the quality of his presentation. The book will be extremely very useful to me and my wife who intend to embark on this pilgrimage as soon as we have sufficient funds.The condition of the used book I purched was good and I am happy with it.ThanksChandra"
2,"if you enjoy the version from pearl jam you'll like this, a little history behind the music"
2,"This book is highly influential. Many works on nonlinear modelling have cited this book. Written by one of the Noble econometricians, this book is surprisingly not hard to follow.The explanations are clear and concise. Theories, modelling strategies, and empirical applications are covered in detailed. If you are a researcher or student wanted to learn state-of-the-art techniques in nonlinear modelling, this book is a good start."
2,"We got this to go with a handmade magnet board for our 2 year old grand daughter for Christmas. The magnet are cute and yet natural in their marking easy for her to identify. The magnets seem strong enough to hold them in place really well. My ONLY complaint is that the ""top"" of the box does not fit to ""stay"" on. The wooden box is cute and her mom will use it for other things but we had to get her a ""plastic"" clear box to store them in when she is not using them."
2,My kids absolutely love these magnets! One is 16 months and the other 6 years and they both have fun. There are a few that are on the small side so those stay up high when the little one is around. There are only about 3 or 4 that are small so it's great for them both!
2,"My 19 month old loves these and so do I. Many children's magnets have small round magnets on the back which can be a choking hazard. The entire back of these is magnetic, so it's all one piece and safe. The illustrations are adorable, but not cartoony, so it's clear what the animal is.My daughter loves to take them off the fridge, show them to me and make the noise associated with it. We also have the (fisher price?)magnetic farm thing. The one where the child connects the front and back of the animal and a little song plays. The Melissa & Doug magnets are much more popular with my daughter and more educational."
2,"My daughter received this for Christmas to go with an art easel that had a magnetic board. The animals are all fairly large and are so cute. My daughter loves to pull them out, put them on the board, tell me what they are and then make their sound. It is a great learning tool for teaching animals, their sounds, and classification (there are domestic animals, farm animals and exotic animals)."
2,These magnets are very nice and are holding up well into week two of vigorous use. My only complaint is that they are proportionately sized. The chicken isn't appreciably smaller than the horse. Minor complaint. My toddler loves the. And I am using them with letter magnets to learn animals and letters.
2,"Kim, the main character has a lot on her plate to deal with, but I'm impressed at her maturity. I also liked the fact that she sees her own mistakes, the cute little quirks about writing her column, and I was quite surprised by the twist near the end. I wasn't expecting that so soon, but it made me cry. I think this book would be a good book for any teen because it shows teens being teens, and their (human side)--that we are all capable of making mistakes, but we learn from them. Kim is a good role model. I'm forty-nine years old, and I enjoyed this book so much, I ordered the other two."
2,"I look forward every year to Douglas Florian's latest poetic subject matter and am never disappointed! Mammalabilia is delightful stuff; brilliant, original, hilarious, and even educational...Keep up the great work!"
2,"I am currently in Australia and ordered this title to watch on a multizoned player. Unfortunately this title appears to have RCE protection on it. If you are not using a region 1 player or do not have the ability to manually select any region, stay away and wait for your local release which should turn up one millenium ;). A pox on you MGM!:o("
2,"Great film with: great cast-good solid script-and great music. So many good scenes of humor, pathos, and courage as we watch the hardened seasoned gun fighter, at last find a fight worth fighting. A definite watch."
2,"It is nice to see the good guys come together to help the ones who need it with being paid for it. No dirty language, sex or any of the really violent themes. Just the good guys doing their job and winning."
2,Of course this remake is a lot better than the original because of the all around tiough guys that make up the Seven.
2,"Kawabata, in this book, produces a characteristic sense that, yes, indeed, this is true: that the author not so much invents or writes as records facts.Repressed passions and pain, conflicted desires, apathy, pessimism and hopelessness are all part of Kawabata's landscape, as well, and here, he has found a setting for these emotions in tea. Know nothing about tea? It's allright, you know something about life, and that's what we're talking about."
2,"video is just as described, but much harder than it looks for an amateur. Good thing is that she starts out for people just like myself!! Good workout too!"
2,"if you do not know how to dance ,if you need the bellydance techniques this is what you are looking forbut it is not a workout to loose weight it teach you how to dance only"
2,Arrived quickly. Just what I expected. A great commentary. Plain language used; easy to digest. Of great value to anyone seeking solid Bible knowledge.
2,"While reading this book, I felt like I was floating through the world and my interactions with people. I felt graceful, peaceful & calm. Isn't that what every girl wants? After borrowing this book from a friend, I had to have my own copy.(p.s. I would have given this book 5 stars instead of 4, but some of the stuff I had a hard time relating to. I am a vegetarian and into animal rights and the book gives a few meat recipes and encourages one to wear fur - not for me. But over was good.)"
2,My Private Jet is black with gold and multicolor holographic glitter. A classic shade! The holo is pretty subtle so it's very wearable and the wear time is great. You can wear for a good five days without any big chipping. This is a color for every collection!
2,This adapter functions well and is good quality. The only draw back is limited acceptablity when the car's outlet is in the console in front of a manual stick shift as on my 2002 VW Jetta. In my case it nearly eliminates access to one outlet.
2,"Her writing focuses on the ""nuttiness of everyday life"" says the L.A. Times, adding that ""life around her house sounds like so much fun, you almost want to move in with her.""Tiano turns every topic from dieting to hurricanes to telemarketers into hilarious reading. I loved reading her columns when I lived in Texas. It's great that she has a book out so more people can discover her.Treat yourself to a good laugh as you read Gina's description of preparing for a hurricane or a day spent shopping in Mexico."
2,"I paid more money to have it shipped in two days but it was longer. I felt I paid extra for nothing. It was about 5 days, I think.Other than that, Book condition was good."
2,"This is one of my favorite movies. If you like Andy Warhol and Edie Sedgwick this is the movie for you. Sienna Miller plays the perfect ""It Girl"""
2,considering that one of the mystics is an old friend from our childhood...I liked it. I am sharing it with my family
2,"Excellent creativity in this wide ranging soundtrack. 1/3 dark, moody music and the rest is either instrumental or upbeat.I use this to help me get into my Spanish role-playing character's mindset.Chris"
2,"I came to Zappa as a child when he was in his prime, and came back as an adult just as impressed with his clever ideas, musicianship and ideas. I love his sense of humor and irreverence. I have only owned two Zappa albums but will probably purchase more since listening to this one."
2,"I mix a scoop of Perfect Food with a banana and orange juice with ice in the blender everyday.. it tastes good, it gives you solid veggie and fruit servings, and it wakes you up a little as well... pricey but worth it if you are serious about your health..."
2,"Not sure which product I read where folks said this doesn't have a pleasant taste, but its okay by me. The challenge is mixing it thoroughly. This will be a something I can do every day .. have veggies as part of my food plan. :-)"
2,"John Thaw is superb in the lead character. This first installment depicts the new relationship between Morse and Sgt. Lewis, and how they come together. In this early episode, Morse is as unorthodox in his approach to solving homicides as he is throughout the series. Sgt. Lewis just begins to get as idea of what his job will be like working (and drinking) with the Chief Inspector."
2,"This movie is about adolescent confusion and what it can lead to. Things go as bad as it gets for this young boy who loses way. Having a very pessimistic portrayal the movie shows how this boy devastates himself not willing but mostly by situation, wrong guidance and and wrong choice. This movie has a tremendous impact and you cant get it out of your head for days...powerful, subtle and free-flowing...get the viewer to ride with it and when it ends you feel like the character himself. Nothing similar to anything I ever watched before..its different from the rest."
2,"Luckily I was able to get the Criterion disc just before it was discontinued. As for that disc, I was very pleased with what I got. I found the image very clear and I love how I can actually read the digital subtitles. I liked the idea of the commentaries, one in English and one in French, although my french is not up to par, but I think they're both close enough to each other. The thing I love baout this film mostly is how the simple story of the life of a particular boy can be so exciting and never boring."
2,"Featuring a startlingly natural performance from a young Jean-Pierre Leaud as Antoine Doinel, this is a vital, hard-nosed, witty, quirky film that stays in the heart and mind of the viewer long after that famous freeze frame at the end has vanished from the screen. Unmissable."
2,"By far the best album from ""new age"" era, including marvelous pieces like ""leaving this place"" and ""the dachstein angels""... I envy you if you never have listened to it"
2,"This is a nice durable toy, it is a little hard to put together some of the pieces and one piece was missing, but my child still has loads of fun with it."
2,"This is an excellent book! It isn't the start of a series, like some authors are fond of writing, but a well-written, fast-paced and adventurous book that has a beginning, a middle, and an action-packed and satisfying end! Based on something that was actually planned by Imperial Germany, the air of genuine possibility sets this book apart from other alternate history books that are merely speculative. This was a story that really did come close to being reality and that makes the book all the more compelling. If you like history, this is a good book to read. If you like alternate history, as I do, this book should define the genre for you. I *HIGHLY* recommend this book and I recommend that when you're done with it you hang on to it and read it again and again!"
2,This is a well written and very enjoyable storty. Some great reasearch had to have gone into this book. One of the best alternate time line stories.
2,"Alternate historical fiction is one of my favorite reads, and 1901 is an excellent example of the genre. Taking plausible circumstances, and tweaking history just a bit, 1901 gives the reader a could-have-been invasion of the United States by an aggressively imperialistic Germany, led by Kaiser Wilhelm II. Robert Conroy makes his characters come alive, and his images are impressive (especially the burning of Manhattan, and the initial German landing that results in the massacre of American civilians). Germany's brutal treatment of the civilian population - a historical fact borne out by its actions in conquered territories during World Wars I & II - gives the story a passion that has you rooting for the Kaiser's defeat. Anyone who enjoys alternate historical fiction will enjoy this book."
2,"While I was reading the book I kept thinking, ""This is about me."" Enduring Legacy captures the essence of what it means to me a Basque American in Idaho. Mark and John artfully depict the subculture of the Basque community in Idaho. Anyone who enjoys learning about other cultures must read this book. You will find yourself reading it cover to cover the first time you pick it up.If I were to teach a class on Idaho history, this would be a mandatory text. It is an historical treasure for the Basque community in Idaho"
2,This book was the worse book that I have read. The worse part about it is that I brought it intead of getting it from the libary. SAVE YOUR MONEY!! I wish I would have.
2,"If there were a ""0"" that's what I would give this book! Flyy Girl was very good so of course I expected the follow-up to be just as good as if not better than the original.I was so disappointed! I kept reading only because I thought that it would just have to get better - unfortunately it didn't!It was very, very, boring!I wouldn't wish this read on my worst enemy!"
2,"""For the love of money is okay, but I must agree with the readers that the pitch to make Fly Girl a movie and reference to himself was rather arrogant. Allow the readers to put the pressure on hollywood if that what they want. My biggest comment is the poetry that was reflected in the book. As a poet, I am the first to realize that poetry is truly subjective. But the poetry in the book was BAD!!!!. I love the idea of blending poetry with the storyline, however, there needs to be a balance. The poetry itself would not stand up to the critical audiences of Chicago. Omar, it is a blessing to be able to sell books on your name, now give us what you are capable of. Your books have diminished in quality."
2,"I felt that this sequel was a waste of time. It was well written, but failed to keep my attention. I think it was a poor sequel. It failed to provide any exciting action. Yeah, she grew up and all, but omar should have added some action packed scenes to keep the reader interested. I read flyy girl about 6 or 7 yrs ago when i was in junior high school and it took me about a day and a half to read, because it was filled with action. This book took me about three weeks, because i was very uninterested. And to top it off, the ending made me even more upset. The point of a novel is to keep the reader interested and/or teach a lesson. This book did teach a lesson but it did not keep my interest. I think Omar sould have incorporated more incidents of racism, sexism, etc."
2,"This book was suppose to be the sequel to Flyy Girl. I was really looking forward to reading a good book, but For The Love Of Money was truly a BIG disappointment. Giving this novel two stars is probably over rating it! REALLY! I read this book in spurs. It took almost a month to finish it......B-O-R-I-N-G!"
2,"I bought this book knowing it was going to be as good as Flyy Girl, but I was wrong. It's so BORING! I'm trying to keep reading it thinking it will get better, but so far NO LUCK. I regret buying it and I wish I would've listened to the previous readers. Take it from me: Don't buy this book! You will be bored to death UGH"
2,My friend purchased this book for me because I love Flyy Girl so much. I tried to read it but it just sucks. I would not recommend this book to anybody
2,this book is a complete disappointment. The first was a coming of age tale that even hit close to home with someone as young as me. I hated the Omar Tyree references and the boring life of Tracy. He should of left the uncompleted life of Tracy alone. My imagination would of came up with a better ending.
2,"I really expected a lot more. The only thing this book did was tell us what happened to Tracy. I felt like Omar was building us up for the big climax all the way through the book, but we never got there. The book contained no twists, turns or bumps in the road. If you haven't read Fly Girl, you will even more disappointed."
2,"If you want Tracy & Victor to live happily ever after don't read this book! Not only do they not get back together but what happened between them made it even worse! Omar how could you???!!! I almost wanted to cry as hard as Tracy! But Victor does bring up some valid points about why their love wasn't meant to be.I agree with alot of the reviews that this book is very hard hard to follow and get into to. I read Flyy Girl in 2 days & it's taking me forever to try to get through FTLOM. I had already read the reviews on here but I still decided to get it anyway because I wanted updates on Victor, Raheema, Mercedes & her family (where is Carmen, Bruce, Timmy, Cash & Jantel??).Pick this one up from the library if you can."
2,"I really hated this book. Flyy girl was one of the best books i ever read. This book was how do i say it TRASH. I thought i did nothing but waist my time and money on this book. When i heard for the love of money flyy girl returns i was thinking oh another great book that i can refer my girls to but ant wrong THIS BOOKS SUCKS.the best part was the first chap. maybe 1st 2-3 pages when she was saying what was going on with every one, but after that it all goes down hill. :( i just wish i would have came here and read some reviews before i bought it."
2,"I ordered this DVD for a birthday present for my Mother. Unfortunately as all the family are sitting down ready to watch the movie, it becomes obvious it is American format and won't play. How crazy that I order a movie in the UK, it is shipped to a UK address but is in American format. Very Very disappointed."
2,the product pictured now is not the item first pictured. the other item has a velcro strap over the back of the hand this item straps in the palm of the hand . this item serves a different purpose and is not why i bought it .I AM NOT SATIFIED.
2,"In the head of Laura Albert, that is. And that's why the NYTimes just dumped ""Leroy"" and his Deadwood article (because the ""writer"" couldn't provide very basic proof that he wasn't Laura Albert).Naturally, unlike most people who have been wrongly accused of something they aren't guilty of, Laura Albert herself has made no public effort to claim she isn't her creation. As such, none of what's written about in this novel rings true or was based on honest experiences. Although the books by Albert as J.T. makes for an interesting study in penis envy taken to the extreme. Otherwise, nope, nothing in Heart really happened. Faketion, indeed! But if you want to believe J.T. isn't Mrs. Albert, I've got some ocean front property here in Arizona you might be interested in..."
2,"Spend your money elsewhere. There's not a single original idea or voice in any of it, completely ripped off from better writers.Interesting someone would give these books such high ratings without even reading them first. Hmmmmmmmmmmmm..."
2,"This is a great and entertaining read-- FOR A CHILD-MOLESTING PEDOPHILE, MAYBE!! Laura Albert (the pyschopath behind J.T. LeRoy's hoax) is a disgusting individual. She has written about sex with children and people have praised her. The fact that there is a child in her care disturbs me greatly and now that her cover has been blown, I certainly hope the proper authorities have been notified.The rest of the book is just a joke as well. Although I really enjoyed Sarah (the book, not the character), the writing in this particular piece of junk was bland, the situations blatantly unrealistic and the characters were just plain bad. I can't believe she wasn't figured out after this hit the bookstore shelves."
2,"What's this other person below talking about? Is he reading a script? I have this printer, and it .... It prints a lot of dots, and the coloring is often not what it should be. I've had it cleaned and everything. It just isn't a good printer. VERY loud, and takes a good 3-4 minutes to warm up before you can do anything with it. Buy something else like I should have."
2,".Be forewarned: most positive reviews were FAKED.Take a look at most of the positive 5-star reviews (click on ""See all my reviews"" next to the reviewer's name).The VAST majority of them were all done within a few days, by a person who had never done any OTHER reviews of ANY sort -- before or after.Glad I checked into this before wasting my money and contributing to an obvious ""hit piece"" on Larry Norman based on a BOGUS rating!"
2,"bought a pyle gear 6x8 ...awesome! but this pyle plus made my frustrations :( installation was easy and comes with crossover..plastic finish is not that good..but the sound quality is nice..in the first 2 weeks! noticed that it is releasing crackling sound on one of the tweeters...i suspected my HU settings so I adjusted, the same thing..logically if the HU setting was bad for the tweeters, it should blown also the other one..can't increase my volume level for the mean time till i purchased a new tweets... will try kicker to blend with my subs that i also purchased here in amazon :)"
2,"The movie was weak. Weak in character development and plot. The climatic battle needed more and the ending was to perfect. The movie could have been good, but wasn't. With all the other family fantasy books and movies out there, I would say don't go with this one."
2,"Having long been a fan of the Dark Is Rising book(s), I was really disappointed in this move adaptation. I understand the need to make a movie exciting, but and might have excused that, but the acting was so flat on top of the changes that seemed to lessen the story. I'm a fan of Christopher Eccelston and he just wasn't big enough in this movie, and I know he could have been wonderfully so. Also, the script did not do the character of Merriman Lyon justice. So basically, if you love the books, you'll be disappointed in this adaptation. But even as a standalone move it had several shortcomings."
2,"First came Harry Potter, followed soon by the Narnia movies, Spiderwick Chronicles, The Golden Compass and a whole host of other fantasy movies starring white, English/American pre-adolescent children revolving around Good vs Evil. All have been based on successful books, and all have a built-in audience they cater too. Most of the movie adaptations have turned out good to great; but there is the occasional stinker, and this probably counts as the stinker of 2007. The movie has an all too simple plot; a boy discovers he has magical powers and learns to use them just in time to defeat an evil white guy on a horse. The boy is aided by a brotherhood of magicians; all white of course, with English accents too. The only authentic part of this movie is the fact that our boy hero saves his long-lost twin brother in the end. Everything else about this movie is too cliche. Don't waste your time or money on this movie."
2,"Well, I hate to be negative but I found Judith O'Brien's Maiden Voyage to be uninspiring. There was no romance; just a quickie between two people that you didn't even think felt anything for each other through the whole book. A ghost that's in love with a sickly, childlike, couch-ridden maiden. The people of Ireland were depicted as strange and the location depressing. The only good part of the book was the pub scenes. Which took up about a page."
2,"I was really excited to get the game...until a began playing it. The forced story line is not what I expected. I got through the game only because I wanted to see what was next in hopes that it got better (which it didn't). The side games are pretty lame. The only one I continued to play was kheel haulin cards. It was a decent game except when the computer takes YOUR cards at random! That was really frustrating. The game has no instruction on how to really play it, and why it is ok for the computer to take your cards and you can not take theirs. I wanted to throw the game against the wall a couple of times for sure.Don't waste your time. Get the computer version if you want to play The Sims."
2,"We had high aspirations and scrupulously read this book looking for guidance, all to no avail. This book contains incorrect and misleading information. We tried the various links for additional data many of which were no longer on the web. Others that we contacted via e-mail the response was not what was designated in the book. Peter and Tara provide their e-mail addresses, but they neither respond nor answer questions. The only conclusion that one can draw is that they crank out the books just to sell them and make a quick dollar. They don't really intend to be there for the consumer. We have since spoken with others who purchased the book and they were also disgusted and very disappointed. This book was a total waste of money. The only thing that it is good for is the garbage or fireplace."
2,I received this product and was excited at first but not all of the discs work. Season three the first two discs will not play at all. I have only watched the first couple of discs from season 6 and have not been able to watch the first two. Not sure if I received a bad copy but as of now I would not recommend it to anyone. Will probably see if I can return the whole thing or if they can send me new copies of season 3 and season 6. The other seasons work fine.
2,"Why anyone in an educational setting would choose to show this video is beyond me.While it condemns stereotyping of blacks, it is rife with stereotypes of Southern whites. Come on teachers - preview what you intend to show and then suck it up if it isn't worth showing and you don't have an easy planning period. You can always read them a good book instead."
2,"I cant belive this has good ratings, We must have noot been reading the same book!Couldnt get past 10 pages. Yes thats all it took. Main character sounded to much like a country hick.I dont like to get refunds expecially if i have read any of it, but this book was to much."
2,"This dresser is quite possibly the worst piece of junk I have ever purchased. It weighs a ton, is so poorly made, the drawers are very shallow and impossible to pull out. I can't even believe Target would put their brand on this product. Don't waste your money thinking that this is a nice cheap dresser...it's a complete waste! Look at the reviews on Target...eveyone agrees with me."
2,"Although this book does a good job explaining, be careful - the solutions have MANY errors."
2,"I own this book. I also own the other books by this author. After doing some research on the author and this group, I am very sorry I spent any money. All kaleidoscope books by this author are just propaganda for the author and her business...the Brewster Society. The books leave many talented, and in some cases very influential, artists out. It is rare if anyone represented in her books doesn't belong to her group (there are exceptions, but only because they already had a reputation before Cozy wrote about them). A lot of good dealers are left out (on purpose), and a lot of great kaleidoscope photographers are left out. This is Mrs. Baker's idea of what the kaleidoscope world should be and not a true representation of the real kaleidoscope world at all! Save your money!"
2,"The first two songs on this cd are fine. After that, the instrutmental section is so loud that you can hardly hear the vocals. I found the same to be true on the cd of the Greatest Hits by the Mamas and Papas. Very disappointed!"
2,"This is a very poor product. I have been using products like this for over 20 years, I want my money back, Wheres my reciept, and where do i send it?"
2,The DVDs are in poor condition. Could not be worse.There are several episodes in wich you can even watchsuch many problems. If you want to see Xena don't buy.
2,"I thought this was the 7th edition, I looked as hard as I could but couldn't find the edition on it. I was looking at a hard cover 7th edition and this was listed under paperback for the 7th but when I got it it was the 6th edition. The preview showed the 7th too."
2,This has to be the biggest waste of Blue Ray technology yet. The acting was bad - the visuals were bad - the story was bad - need I say more!
2,"LOL.. When will this ever end...? Category 1, then 2, 3,4,5,6 and now 7..?I wonder what kind of ""super-duper"" storms we will see in Category 8, 9, 10... 34... 98.Well at least they picked a category number for the movie title.. so they can go on for ever. Imagine if they had titles like ""Storm"", ""Super storm"".. ""super-duper storm""... ""zzuper storm"".. ""so strong we dont have a name for it storm"" (I might actually have watched the last one.. lol)"
2,"I bought this book for my son thinking that it would be full of color photos, copious amounts of information, and entertaining reading. It turns out that the book is very small, has too little information, and no color plates at all. It is way over priced.This is the problem I have found with trying to buy a book sight unseen off Amazon.com and other similar sites. One expects to get good value for money but ends up getting ripped off."
2,I really believe that this person feels they have truly traversed through a journey for information or enlightenment. Myself I think he chewed way to many peyote buttons while in the desert.
2,"Same situation..but it's a supplier issue not Amazon's. I ordered on Jan 18 from another website, PowerSellerNYC, because they actually showed availability but after 3 weeks of waiting and 3 calls, they finally admitted that they were expecting some in from China but the order never arrived. My local Best Buy has been sold out since Christmas. The only reason I didn't cancel my order is because based on previous owners feedback, this system is the best value out there. I'm traveling to China in two weeks...and probably pass the boat that it is on.When it is in my hands and I see what it can do, maybe I will join the ranks and give it a 5 star rating."
2,"Arrogance does not begin to describe the author's perspective toward those with whom she interacts throughout her little adventure. Her insecurity is clearly derived from an inferiority complex - or god forbid a superiority complex - gone awry while working side-by-side with world-renowned experts in the human rights field. As evidenced in her tales, she does not take criticism well, and always blames personality flaws in others while devoid of any self-critique. Her negative portrayal of those she worked with is often shallow, and demonstrates that she learned little to nothing ABOUT her colleagues, while ironically failing to appreciate all that she did learn FROM them. Sorry you had to share a tent, but grow up, Clea; the real story is NOT about you. Your pettiness is a disservice to the victims who, throughout your book, remained buried under that chip on your shoulder."
2,"Poorly written AND edited. I was expecting an interesting, enlightening story of forensic anthropology and recent political events; instead a story of office politics and one woman's not very compelling career.The author is arrogant; I wonder what her colleagues think of her version of events? Not a very good writer; I was confused at times of who she was exhuming from what grave, and what part of the body she was speaking of.How could a book about thousands of murdered people be so lacking in emotion?"
2,While I work in the frield - this book is a tough read. Itr's style and presentation are very complex.
2,"Read this book from cover to cover as an experienced archer and thought most of the information was superfluous. Authors tried to cover all aspects in a very brief amount of time and text. Methods are too standard stated in a matter-of-fact manner disregarding other theories, practices and methods. This book might be good for a boy scouts counselor but not a serious archer with goals of competition and proficiency. All illustrations are hand drawn leaving out critical detail."
2,"Without a doubt one of the most pathetic films ever made. Extreamly bad acting, Stupid camera angles, Most of the time you cant tell what is happening. The transforming from animals to humans vice vera is the worst effect ever, Basicly you see a bird flying and in the next shot (About a second after) the hairy chuck norris is standing there. Punches look so fake its amazing, Incredibly bad directing makes it look like a 9 year old could of done better if he went into the woods with a cam-corder and some pals. The budget is obvisly tighter than an italien waiters trousers and the only reason chuck norris is in the movie is beocouse the film was made by his brother aron nossis! I really really, really really recomend not buying this film."
2,"They worked great for awhile...but my best guess would be that I got no more than 120...and maybe as few as 70...charges/recharges out of the last two sets of these before giving up on them. Granted, this made them a cost-effective purchase versus regular alkaline batteries. However, based on the claim on the package (not sure they are still making this claim on newest packages) that you can expect as many as 1000 charging cycles out of these, I was disappointed."
2,"After a full charge and just storing them on the shelf, not installed, the batteries fully discharge after two weeks. I do not have this problem with Sony or Sanyo batteries. The Energizer batteries are the made in Japan versions. Save your cash and buy a different brand."
2,"I have purchased close to 80 of these batteries, and found that about 1 out of every 4 had a bad discharge rate. I would charge them in sets of four, let them site for one week, then put them on a tester to see which ones were bad. I found that they normally show about 1.29V-1.30V after sitting a week, but the bad ones show about .95V. I am not at all happy with the 2500 MAh batteries, however, I was happy with Energizer's previous 2200 and 2300 MAh versions."
2,I have to charge the batteries immediately before using them in my digital camera. Even if they lay around for a few days after being fully charged they will not power my digital camera. I guess I am going to the Sanyo Eneloop batteries.
2,Ok i bought these online 8 total..compared to my 1 year old rayovac rechargeable batteries these last half as much or less. i duno maybe they are bad batch or just junk..do not buy these..look else where/different brand
2,"As with a number of other reviews, my experence with these batterys was disappointing. They worked fine at first, but even when new, I noticed that they would be dead after a month or so. But as I continued to use the batterys, this problem got progressivly worse. By the time the batterys had about 30 charge cycles, afully charged set barly lasted a week sitting unused.If I have a planned shoot with my camera (a Canon powershot a530) the batters still work ok charging them the night before the shoot. But if the camera has been sitting around a cuple of weeks and I want to take some spur of the moment photos, I keep some disposable lithium batterys on hand. I also take the disposable lithiums as backups when I am out shooting.I am going to serch for a different brand of rechargables after my experence with these!!"
2,My purchase from overstock.com has been my worst experience every buying online. My order took twice as long to receive as advertised. Then the item was wrong. Then overstock.com is never in a hurry to fix any problem. I would not recommend overstock.com to anyone.
2,"I used these batteries once, and now they will not charge properly. I use a Kodak NiMH charger that shuts down when done. The charger operates well using other NiMH cells. These Energizer batteries kept charging overnight and would not stop. The batteries got very warm. I believe that they are shorted."
2,This is a difficult book to write a review for.I agree with most/all of what the author writes but found the style highly annoying. The book contains huge amounts of waffle and very little real advice.I am using Neurofeedback for personal growth and hopped this would have some practical advice. There was very little of this.I understand it is difficult with an area like this to not be a bit of a salesman but way too much sales going on here.
2,"I found this book to be nothing but alot of mumbo jumbo, I felt as tho I was reading the same thing over and over and got very bored with it. alot of it made absolutely no sense to me either, I found it to be a real sleeper! Altho I did enjoy the first book I read from her, called spritual growth, that book was very interesting."
2,"Charlie covered a lot of interesting topics. However, there are too much preaching about his programming philosophy and not enough explanation on each topic. Many of the examples contradict his programming style."
2,"I do hope that the price for that book is a typo. $71.66? You have to be kidding, Oh, I forgot. plus shipping!"
2,"Why isn't there a 1/2 star rating available? Shouldn't the production of some CDs be declared an environmental hazard, if only because of the not so ""beautiful noise"" pollution? Seriously, Neil, thanks, but I don't think so."
2,"When you hold a Ipod in your hand you can feel the quality built into the unit. But pick up the Sima Hitch and you immeditately get the feeling that they skimped everywhere they could to build this thing.The first unit I got through Amazon was DOA on arrival in it's sealed box. The vendor took his sweet time to get back to me.I called Sima and they were very accomodating, I shipped the product to them and they returned it and they replaced it with a brand new unit.The Unit does NOT work on all USB devices as advertised - USB HARD DRIVES are ignored and unrecognized.The wheel is cheeply made and I dont think it will be long before it breaks.The Transfers are SLOW at best.My Recommendation, wait and see if they come out with a Hitch 2.0"
2,..the microswitches of the POV switch loose contact (bad solder points) or the X/R-axis potentiometers wear out (after 1-6 weeks). The latter just happened to my 5th (!) Freedom 2.4 after 3 weeks (the former doesn't happen if you resolder them switches after you unpacked the stick..) I'm done w/ Logitech until they change back to non-mechanical pickups for the X/Y/R axis (like the Interceptor.) I'd recommend the Logitech WingMan Extreme Digital 3D or (if you can get your hands on one..) the Microsoft Force Feedback 2 (red skin edition). Stay away from the Logitech Extreme 3D Pro Joystick -- the pot problem is worse w/ that one !(...)
2,"I have had no problems with any of the Logitech products (including their joysticks). This Logitech Freedom has given me nothing but problems. After using two defective joysticks, I lost my patience.The joystick wouldn't respond to movement right after I took it out of the box and installed the software. I liked the idea of having a cordless joystick, so I got a replacement. After 1 month with the new one (and not having used it in 2 weeks) one of the buttons stopped functioning. I have never had a problem with Logitech joysticks in the past--but this one has been a hassle! Save yourself trouble and money--don't buy the cordless!The joystick is flimsy and button placement is terrible. The only thing nice about the cordless is that beam range is excellent and it's a USB. Don't waste your money on this! (Unless you want to have a 'new' joystick every month)."
2,"Wireless is a cool feature, very convenient. The weight is good, grip is nice and firm, but the whole thing is not particularly ergonomic, though -- kinda awkward to hold with the other hand while you're playing. Real problem, though: this thing isn't built to last. At all. After a few months, it starts losing calibration, floating all over the place, with the twist function failing to neutralize -- rendering the joystick useless. You can't recalibrate it, and there's zero support from logitech, so suddenly the relative bargain starts looking like less of a good deal. Not getting a replacement -- check out some of the other brands out there."
2,"This joystick is advertised as compatible with Mac systems, specifically OS 8.6 or later. In reality, it is incompatible with System 10 and barely compatible with system 9 since it has no applicable software for Mac. The advertising is wrong and should be changed to ""Not for Mac, PC only"". Very frustrating."
2,"Just as the other Logitech joysticks I've owned, the Freedom 2.4 cordless joystick lost calibration. Maybe not as quickly as the Attack 2 or the Extreme 3D Pro did, but the result is the same. I did get a couple of months out of the Freedom 2.4 before the controller stopped working properly. And I'm not even a serious gamer! Oh, and don't bother trying to contact Logitech about the quality of their products. They won't respond. I've tried 3 of their controllers because they've been all I've been able to find on the shelves here. Let the consumer beware!!!"
2,"The watch was delivered quickly, it looked great but after wearing it less then 3 weeks the leather straps fell apart. My son can not wear it any more."
2,"Many of the ideas are little more than old spouse's tales. Regarding some of the pest control methods, please see this paper: http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1030&context=vpc14"
2,"We went to Circuit City and bought a Phillips MC235, brought it home, and set it up. We bought this unit for its sleek design and space saving abilities. The first disc played a song for 30 seconds before stopping playback, spinning the disc clockwise then counterclock wise, then stopped all together with an ERROR, then NO DISC error. This is an under $80.00 paperweight. All looks, no functionality. We are returning this unit to the store and buying a nice console unit. Brand - new out of the box - it broke! If you want a stereo that looks cool but you don't need it to playback CD's, then this is the unit for you! When your friends come over show off how cool the unit looks, but when they want to hear it in action, change the subject and go out for tacos. It broke within 30 seconds of taking it out of its factory sealed box. 30 seconds - that must be some kind of record."
2,"I bought this book hoping it was as good as some of the others out there. But what I got was a very cheaply produced, mimeographed book offering very general advice. I think Perkins is a joke. Do not waste your time or money, get some of the other comprehensive books out there on dating."
2,"First of all the content adresses the subject well and it isuseful for someone in quantum electrodynamics. Similarinformation has been given in other books.HOWEVER.... I have to agree with the last reviewer. This bookseems to be a copy of the original book, even though cleanlydone ! ...outside cover cheaply printed on spine, no front print,inside pages are photocopies and not original quality pressprinting !!!! In all, it looks like a well done black market copyrather than an original Academic Press book.BEWARE of buying this version. Other sources might berecommended."
2,No you can not use this charger to charge Non Ni type Batteries. See Duracell site for more Info.
2,I had been highly disappointed with this book. It was like reading another book about ancient civilizations and extraterrestial gods - nothing new.
2,"I had higher hopes for this one. In actuality it is a highly superficially written book, which, except for the major story of Dogon's cosmology, contains little material analysis and argumentation for the main hypothesis offered. Especially the word ""scientific"" seems to be highly out of place in the title. If you like Hancock's writing, or similar paleo-archaeology stuff, this book will bring you quite some disappointment."
2,"I read the first 100 pages of the book and couldn't take it anymore. His goal is to confuse the reader by mentioning them names of numerous gods and goddess from all kinds of different ancient civilizations it was hard to keep track of them. Show me more physical evidence of contact with an alien civilization. All Temple does is expand on other peoples work for evidence, he does not go to the actual sights himself to investigate, if you are interested in ancient history conspiracys I would say read any of Graham Hancock's books, way more thorough, the writing was way more organized and entertaining. And he goes to the actual historical sights for his investigations.You know this is a hard book to read and understand when the author has to put summaries at the end of the chapter, to help you try and understand what he was writing!"
2,"I've just completed a course in RF design and realize that this is not text book for a class at all. The book does not show any detail or even clear about the information it brought forth. As a student, this text book does not give details for student to learn. I have never seen a text book that has virtually nothing to teach.Forgive me for giving an undesire review but I'm being honest, and this book does not deserve a Five-star. This is a misdirection of its contents."
2,"Good product, neat, small, useful. TERRIBLE HORRIBLE tech support. Long waits while techie looks up the simplest of questions. They're totally unprepared for the job. And I was given simply incorrect information which I had to wade through with more calls even to find out it was incorrect. If you're not a natural techie, expect a horrible experience with their tech support."
2,GLEN CAMPBELL IS A COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYER NOT ROCK
2,The list of tracks on the site was completely wrong and not what I was looking for. I want my money back.
2,"I collect all things Bowie, but I gotta say, Mr. Bowie doesn't have much to say in this collection(well nothing at all, really). It gives some great insight into some historical moments, but seems to focus on Trevor Bolder's discontent about the Spiders being disbanded. It just makes for sour grapes, really. There are no interviews with Bowie himself, but Angie Bowie does make a a few raucous appearances throughout the DVD. If I knew what this would have turned out to be like, I would have passed on this."
2,"These things are F%^&ng garbage!! Had them installed in a honda civic for about 8 months took great care of them, had system nicely tuned and wired, good amp, and capacitor in line. Subs literally just stopped working. Didnt blow didnt fade out, didnt trip the amp Nothing!! They are still sitting in my living room looking brand new, but just dont work!!1 Save your money they are trash"
2,"Dont buy this product. I have the other mountain bike pump which is same junk just smaller. Its 90% plastic which doesnt hold up even with very occasional use. Save your money, get something else."
2,"Watching the shows put together for this 50th Anniversary edition, I realized just how good the basic writing and story telling of the original series was. The closer the presentation got to nostalgia, especially the 1985 movie-of-the-week, the less I enjoyed the experience. It may be because I was only six-years old when the series debuted, but I ended up wishing this had been straight mysteries from Season 3."
2,"Got the movie as promised, but was not real impressed with it! Definitely not worth the money! A bunch of garbage thrown together from several seasons that didn't make no sense! One wasn't even Perry Mason it was Betty Davis.. four discs an the third one was a bunch of nothing interviews that I had no interest in. Take my word, save your money!"
2,"Perry Mason 50th Anniversary EditionThis is not the Perry Mason DVD I was waiting for. I expected Season Three Vol. 1. I have spent good money on starting my collection of all 9 seasons of the Perry Mason television series. I grew up watching Perry Mason from the very first season. I am not going to buy this edition. I will eventually get the shows from the 50th Anniversay DVD when they are released in the season's Collection. I would also like to see Perry Mason released in full seasons. Stop this Season Two, Volume one bit. Release the full season in one package and be done with it. I also believe the studios are charging too high of a price as compared to some other tv series."
2,The design of this change purse is great. It's a great size but the material is not real leather. It's more like paper with a very thin leather like covering. I guess for the price you shouldn't expect much but I would give this a life expectency of about 2 weeks of consistent use.
2,I thought this item was a steal at $6.00. When I recieved the item I found it to be only worth the price. I will not be using it. I ordered another style for more money. The item is not worth returning. The purse is usable but very simply made.
2,I recently had to get rid of this curling iron. I bought it four years ago. The main problem with it was that it would burn my hair frequently even if it was on the lowest setting. There must have been something wrong with the heating element. Sometimes it would work fine and other times it would work really really badly. After four years it all of a sudden stopped working completely.
2,"was not exactly what I expected, some of the numbers are very good, others I could do without"
2,"The Dummies routine is becomimg a bit tiresome. This book offers very little to the user, besides simple processes that most people could figure out on their own.I once advocated the benefits of the ""Dummy"" line of books - but more and more - it appears to me that the authors and editors are just Cntrl-X/Cntrl-V(cut and pasting) parts of other books into the newer ones.If you want to get your feet wet and not expose yourself to a wonderful program - buy this book.But if you want to see the power of Star Office - look elsewhere and be brave and pick up a non-dummy/idiot book."
2,"Got these balls fast, but one came with a hole in it, one cracked when inflated, and two cracked in a couple of weeks. This order was a complete waste of money."
2,"If I had know the recording quality of this performance was so poor I wouldn't have order it. Bad camera Production, out of focus at times, and unnecessary close-ups of the dancers.Save the Close-ups for the Bonus features not the actual performance."
2,"A feat of rabid and bizarrely calculated self-indulgence, which moves from the irritatingly specific to the ridiculously profound. Only a Yalie could foist these adolescent embarassments on anyone with a straight face. Unbearable live."
2,"I recieved this camera for Christmas and was delighted. It is very easy to use and I didn't need to read through complicated instruction manuals. However, it sure did use up a lot of batteries. I even bought rechargeable batteries, which only lasted for about an hour.However, after using the camera for about a month the LCD viewer stopped working properly (lots of lines through it)and I returned it to Wal-Mart for an exchange.After owning the camera for another 3-1/2 months, I noticed that the area around the most frequently used button (for displaying the pictures)CRACKED! The button was no longer functional. I again returned the camera to Wal-Mart for an exchange. Now, after reading the other reviews, I have decided to return it a third time for a store credit and get a different camera.I would NOT recommend buying this camera."
2,"I am sorry to say this is my third review. The camera changes so much this is necassary. I recieved the camera about a month ago. Read my other reviews for a deeper explanation(happy customer unhappy ones) Here we go: The LCD barely works anymore, most of the time you have to hit the side of the camera just to use the LCD. And when you hit it, the camera goes off, so you have to turn it off then back on. That's all that has changed since I bought it. The picture quality is grainy, reguardless of what anyone says. However, if you shrink the size of the picture to standard 35mm size it is crystal clear. Other than that, everything is okay, I 'll let you know if it changes."
2,"I bought this camera approximately 2 months ago. After much use, I found this product to be literal garbage; as if someone had literally packaged a piece of garbage and sent it to me. The refresh rate on the LCD is horrible, not even worth using. Sometimes to get the LCD screen to work it is necessary to bang on the side of the camera. The viewfinder is blocked by an annoying green light and is off by a few millimeters. The supplied AA's last only about 15 to 20 mins. If you are unfortunate enough to buy this camera, get rechargeables. The picture quality is horrid at best, pictures turning out grainy and pixelated. Overall, buying a disposable 35mm is a better choice."
2,"This book (despite being a 2nd edition) is full of blatant typos and errors. In addition, the author seems to know just enough to hack projects together but not quite enough to write a book. There are many factual errors and misleading opinions.This book is really just a small collection of specific PIC projects the author somehow managed to get working. If one of the projects (as presented) is useful to you, perhaps the price of the book is justified. Otherwise, you're better off with back issues of your favorite electronics magazine. As a general introduction to microcontrollers this book doesn't even come close. If you're interested specifically in the PIC series, you're much better off with one of the David Benson books. If you're interested in other microcontrollers, keep looking..."
2,"I read this book for my book group. I found it boring, the descriptions unrelatable, the characters mostly cursory and the writing almost insulting in the way it explains every little thing to the reader. I forced myself to finish this book, but really wish I hadn't. Although it was interesting to see the way the plot points tied together, I truly wasn't all that interested to find out. I could easily have put it down in the middle and forgotten all about it. I found myself skipping over useless descriptions of people and locations that were irrelevant to the story and added nothing. The story could have been told in half the pages. There were poignant insights and descriptions that were enlightening, but they were rare. I'm shocked to see so many people liked this book."
2,"I am satisfied, I am unhappy with the product because it was not what I ordered.the image has sata connection and that's what I needed"
2,but this album did not do anything for me. All the songs sounded alike to me.
2,"I bought this for my son who has struggled with math in the past. I figured this workbook would help him with his math skills. While it is full of problems, I would say this book is geared more toward a first grade student. Many of the concepts he covered in second grade were not covered in the book. This book was mostly comprised of basic addition and subtraction. After a few problems, I have decided to use this book for his brother who is entering first grade this year. If it makes any difference, I live in Central Jersey, and we are in the public school system."
2,"I recieved a SB18C 18 Volt battery pack instead of a SB18A battery pack. What is in the picture is not what I got. The battery pack I got did not have the battery status indicator. It still works, tomuch of a hassel to return. I expect to get what I order.George Newell"
2,"Hooked this cable up and my screen image went all wonky - changed resolutions, image was shrunk, fuzzy and skewed to one side. Fiddled with settings, it just got worse. Checked connections, no better. Flipped cable end-for-end, no joy. Who'd a thunk. A cable's a cable, right? Well, I guess not, at least not in this case. I do have to give Azon top marks for the ease of return but sure would have been nice to not have to. I hope if you buy one you have better luck than I."
2,"1. I received a 10ft monitor cable (Male to Female) in a ""Male to Male"" package.2. The quality of the connections was poor. I had a difficult time attaching the single male end to my monitor -- the rubber end just slips on the screws. I bought a different cable at the same time and the difference in quality was like night and day.I returned the cable for refund -- there was no way I wanted a replacement of this cable."
2,I had to lower the resolution of my hp laptop to 1024*768 to make it work. Any higher than that would show no signal on the TV. This should have been stated in the item description. I have VGA cable from my ViewSonic monitor and it works very well. Wish I have another one.I will consider returning this unless someone comes up with a soltution and save me a headache.
2,"After hooking the cord up to an additional monitor, the color on the monitor would change to a different shade, almost a pastel color. I tried it on other monitors just to make sure that the monitor wasn't faulty. The fortunate thing is, that it was cheap. Don't buy."
2,I ordered a 12 foot cable and I received a 10 foot cable instead. I am very disappointed with this order.
2,We purchased this to connect our PC to our TV and this item didn't work. We eventually got another- just like it- and it worked. This one must have been defective.
2,This cable is horrible. Windows doesnt recognize the plug and play capability of my 27 inch monitor and I cant even get the correct screen resolution 1080p. I know its not a software issue because the DVI cable I bought works just fine. Overall was a big hassle. You get what you paid for.
2,"The product was working fine initially after I connected to my TV. However with the my dell laptop, the image was flickering on my TV. Although I did not care much, after a month, one fine morning the TV image got blurred and finally got black. Amazon was kind enough to take the product back since the return period lapsed just by 2 days, so made the exception. I will not recommend this product since its not reliable."
2,"I'm not an expert but the problem may come down to how much surrounding interference you've got that's likely to effect a cheap cable that's not adequately shielded. I ran mine through a rat's nest of power cords for four machines with audio and external drive cables in there as well. I've also got two pairs of fairly heavy Altec Lansing speakers alongside the monitor.The resulting signal was seriously ghosted to the point where it bothered my eyes after a couple of hours.To compare, I brought home a VGA cable from work and was shocked at the difference running along the same path. Not only is the picture crisp but the colors are richer.I wish I could recommend the cable from work but I've no idea who makes it - we're a Dell shop and it's got those blue plugs that look like the cables that ship with Dells."
2,"I don't ask much from my cables, i just ask that they take the output from my computer and put the image on my screen without lines missing. I am sorry to say that this cable could not even live up to my hopes. I have missing lines that constantly flicker on my screen. Its almost like 90% of the lines are being refreshed each time and the rest are left blank and its dizzying to look at. It is not my computer as i plug it in to other monitors and even my tv and everything is fine, and its not my monitor because whatever i plug the cable into it into exhibits the annoying line problem. Beware of bad QC."
2,"This cable turned my display yellow and the cable was very temperamental, we had to prop it on a book and have it twisted a certain way to make it work sometimes. Maybe it was defective but I forgot to return it by the deadline and it wouldn't be worth it to pay for shipping to return it. I did like the length of it though."
2,"terrible cable, ghosting is very evident. Probably cheap and inadequate shielding. I wonder if theferrite cores are real, probably fake. Hooked up my old more expensive cable and you can easily tellthe better quality..this is going back to Amazon. Amazon: this brand is NOT UP TO YOUR STANDARDS!"
2,"didnt work for connecting my laptop to my 32 inch tv, and there was some kind of buzzing on the tv, anyway it worked OK for my 19 inch monitor, but it still has some flaws with the monitor, had to buy a insulated grounded vga for the tv, that one works great. i still have to buy another vga cause this one sucks"
2,"This seems to be a nice quality cable based on looks, but it does not perform as expected. A huge number of resolution choices are available, but any selected (including the native res of the monitor) result in a blurry image. Unusable for my purposes."
2,The brightness channel on the cable I recieved is malfunctioning. does not work! do not buy.
2,Just when I needed to use this cable I learn that it is not the cable I ordered. It is a male-female and I ordered a male-male cable. Probably way too late to return it.
2,Do not buy it does not work.buy a hdmi better those work better.so do not not buy buy.buy beer instead
2,I bought this cable thinking that all the VGA cables are the same. However my idea was wrong because I could learn that this cable doesn't support more than 1024 by 764 pixels. My computer monitor is 21 inches and if I use the VGA cable that came with the computer I have higher resolution options for the monitor display. When I use this VGA cable it gives monitor quality option only up to 1024 by 764 pixels. So if you have a bigger computer monitor or if you want to use this cable for a bigger screen I don't recommend this cable. Hope this helps!!
2,It works when it feels like it. Sometimes it'll just stop working. I used it for my tower to HDTV and others to test it. Wouldn't buy it again.
2,"Caused colors to ""smear"" and black text to pixelize on my Samsung 943BT monitor. I replaced it with a 6-foot Samsung cable with ferrites on each end and now the display is crisp again."
2,this mag holder may work great for the Glock 9mm's but it won't hold a Glock 22 40 s&w double stack mag. If you're shooting a Glock 22 don't buy this product.
2,"A good book, but not very helpful. There are some great resources and referrals available, and some good ideas, I just don't think that the book addresses itself to the severity of the issue. Very high and optimistic thinking, but seemed to offer quite naive advice relative to the issue."
2,"Thought the info was probably all here but didn't like that it wasn't clearly presented: the editing (too wordy) and organization of the materials seemed weak. Probably just a bit dated. I recommend Terry Hewitt's ""Complete Book of Cacti & Succulents."""
2,For a beginner the book is OK. The pictures are very nice too. It also gives information on the temperture and conditions to grow cactus. I am happy to have this book in my collection of cactus books. I was happy at the reasonable price of this book too.Louise
2,Th light works well. However it is not bright enough for night riding. This light is more suited to being a safety feature to allow others to see you rather than to illuminate the road ahead . You would be much better off with a halogen bicycle light which would provide much better illumination.
2,"I purchesed linspire 5.0 expecting an easy time. But, I have the linux modem blues. I have sucessfully installed modems with redhat 9 and lycoris, but with linspire I am surprised to be having such hassles. A usb external wasn't seen. I yanked my pci modem and put in an agere chipset modem. Linspire sees it, but I get a 'no dial tone' window. I reboot witht the same computer into windows 2000 and the modem works fine. Really, if this is supposed to be such an easy distro of linux, why haven't they resolved this stuff? I find little information on the linspire web site. And of course, without a working modem, the cnr is totally useless! So, here I am going on to modem #3, scouring the web trying to find something compatible. Arrgh!"
2,"The container does keep the bread fresh, however, it can be extremely difficult to open. I spent a good 30 minutes trying to pry the thing apart and proceeded to throw it out. If re-designed with a simpler way to get to the bread it could work. Other Desidry products I have work well."
2,"The title, ""Inklings of Democracy in China"" is greatly misleading. The book spends the first chapter exclaiming the ethnocentricity of western democracy, re-defining the very of concept of ""democracy"" itself. Suzanne Ogden plants the seed of a relativistic outlook on what she deems ""democracy"", and uses this new postmodern take on ""democracy"" to justify China's government.To save you a little time from this 400 page read, this is Ogden's argument:a. Democracy can be interpreted to be Chinese Communismb. China's government is nothing but Chinese Communismc. China has a democracyA better (and more honest) title of Ogden's book would have been ""China - How One Should Change the Definition of Democracy to Whatever the Hell They Want"""
2,"This book was absolutely horrible. It had nothing to do at all with the premise outlined in the back of the book. It was maybe mentioned for about two or three pages at the beginning of the book an alluded towards the end of book as an after-thought. This book really is about two people fighting with each other, making horrible, hateful slurs on each other's reputation, who all the sudden look at each other and decide that they are in love. Please! Don't waste your money on this book. I wish I hadn't."
2,I find it disgusting and horrible that you could sell or even give someone a product that has a sticker stating this product may contain materials that can cause cancer or reproductive problems. You should be ashamed of yourself for selling this.
2,"Damned !#!?! Philips micro system begins to read but won't play an MP3 disc anymore. Sweet micro system with great sound, but the one single feature I love is gone :("
2,"The design of the device is very simple, and you have to pull equally on both ends of the cord to extend the cable out. Because of this, it is very inconvenient to use, especially behind a desk or in a permanent installation mounted to a wall, which is what I had intended.I ended up returning this and purchasing workshop style cord retracts, which much better suit my purposes even though they are longer than I really needed."
2,this camra is sucks so horably.the screen to veiw your pictures is soo small its not even worth being there u cant even see the picture u just took! nto to mention it sucks the life out of battaries SUPER FAST! and it takes the by far the WORST indor pictures ive ever seen.dont purchase this item its like flushing money down the toilet do your resurch and purchase a better item.
2,"With all the personal experience the author had from her numerous visits to Paris and her many friends living in the city I really thought this was going to be a great book for inside tips. How wrong I was. Very little advice is offered throughout the book. Instead the author focuses on things that are just plain irrelevant - the chef's game, buying sheets and towels and what outfit to wear. Forget about wondering what it is like to have sex with a Frenchman, you will still be in the dark. Look for another book on how to live in Paris, better yet don't buy a book, go and experience Paris for yourself if possible. There is no advice here and even less adventure."
2,"Flat writing makes this book dull, much like a brochure you might get from your brokerage. Too simplistically written to be anything more than a primer for absolute beginners, and even there I think you can do better elsewhere. Later chapters are somewhat useful in explaining the business cycle, but one senses that this book doesn't fulfill its goal."
2,This product is horrible. Instructions were bad and functionality was worse. My father had a better one 35yrs ago!Tried to return and got the run-around. Have since tossed it out and taken the 30 dollar loss.
2,"This pocket eye chart isn't worth the money. The printing is smudged and flaking off, even though it's suppose to be new. The 20/30, 20/20, and 20/15 lines are so poorly printed that you can't read the numbers up close let alone 14 inches away. While it didn't cost a lot, what I paid for it is too much, since the product is useless."
2,"This is really not a nice book, it shows more of that awful house, with skelets stuff, then that it shows you cats. Afwul colors too !!! Better buy photobooks from Hans Silvester, he really shows nice cats.!!!!!"
2,"I'm a huge Tom Berenger fan but I simply can't say anything good about this film. The plot is horrible, the acting unconvincing (even Berenger), the dialouge laughable and the ending, well, sour to say the least. The pits."
2,"I ordered this book thinking it was an informative book on learning body language. Instead, it turned out to be some movie made for HBO. I went ahead and watched it, but honestly if this show had shown up on TV one night, I would have changed the channel. It was really boring, acting was terrible, and predictable. ..."
2,"Bought this for my 4 year old son to help talk to him about strangers, and what they are, and who they are. This doesn't help explain that. An ok story, but he lost interest in this book before I was done reading it. And he loves to read books."
2,"I just finished reading this book and strongly DO NOT recommend it, as it's filled with child and teen rape, mutilations and murders that seem to be done mostly for shock factor. I have little respect for authors who have to use this particular plot device, and this one seems to revel in just how far she can take things. Won't be reading any other works of hers. At all. This book sickened me."
2,It's a story about a guy whose penis get's so big it's a problem for him. The humour is low brow at best and even as a skin flick you'd rent at a motel the quality is bad.If you want to see a movie about a man who goes from micro to giant and only ever see the outline of a fake penis in his pants leg. This is the movie for you.
2,How you can fill a book with nice illustrations and some serious looking text and not being able to learn out anything. This book just confuses and gives pro/E a bad rap.If you can't do anything before buying this book you will for sure not be able after.Refund is you're first thought after reading this book.Buy pro/E wildfire for Designers and learn how to use the program instead!
2,"I purchased this watch for myself on a lightning deal last year. I got a nice price for a very nice watch -- or so I thought.The watch came with a review incentive on a slip of paper included in the box -- a $10 gift for an amazon review within 20 days of purchasing. If I'd left my review within the 20 day period I'd probably have left a pretty positive review. The watch was attractive, and I loved watching the exposed works in action.However, after a few months of careful daily wear the rose gold color wore away on the bezel exposing the stainless steel base metal. I was so disgusted that I gave it to my 10 year old daughter. I'll never buy Stuhrling again."
2,Bought this for my son. After less than two weeks it kept shutting down because the battery circuit was indicating to the unit that the battery was dead. Tried numerous new batteries with same result. Not worth sending back for replacement or refund as it has to be returned via UPS so we would end up with a whopping $9.00 credit. Advise you invest in an upgraded unit by a name brand manufacturer.
2,"Do NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT if you have a mac computer. It says it is compatible, but it's NOT. I tried 3 different ways to load music on this item and it would take maybe 3 out of 25. I called Coby and they told me to download in one format, change songs to another format, it was way to much work to try to figure out for a 20.00 item.SAVE YOURSELF THE HEADACHE AND JUST SPEND THE EXTRA $ FOR AN IPOD SHUFFLE!!"
2,It might be something wrong with the USB power and unit on at the same time. I needed to return for a refund.
2,"The player did not work out of the box. Just appears as an unknow device. After changing my BIOS settings to support USB 2.0, it still did not work, even when a USB 2.0 flash drive did. In all fairness, I have not tried to return it or have it replaced yet."
2,"It was made in Portugal. The color was somwhat disappointing...but, the price is not bad."
2,"I queried piano music for kids. This is really just a BABY BOOK with 2 words per page that happens to be only the words for one single song and the only sheet music is for that SINGLE SONG on the very LAST page. NOT for kids learning to play piano, but really just a sing-a-long book for babies. Seems like a lot of money for just one song even so! I was expecting several John Denver songs in piano sheet music with pictures intertwined after reading the descprition and it was nothing like that."
2,"I bought this book after I read the synopsis. However, I was really, really frustrated that all the pictures were hoax. I mean they just pasted either Elvis's head or his whole body on the pics. Even a kid can tell that the photos are not genuine. And I laughed when I saw the very young Elvis photos in the 90's sightings. He should have been in his 60's, right? Please don't waste your money!"
2,"This book was disappointing overall, although I enjoyed much of the dialogue. I found the two main characters pretty sleazy and ended the book thinking both of them were capable of just about anything bad! However, I'll continue to read and enjoy Ms. Kellogg's Kick Keswick series - those are great!"
2,"I bought this belt 2 months ago, already it doesn't fit. I went by the sizing on the product of 6-14 fits that size...definitely NOT correct. I wear a 12-14, this belt is now way too small. I haven't found it very helpful either. Just feels like it's cutting off my circulation or squeezing baby. Would not recommend. Waste of $40!"
2,"It looks like season 5 and beyond will not come to DVD, it took forever to get season 4 on dvd..."
2,"The original Hydroxycut worked very well till the Feds had them take the guts out of it. Since then, Muscle Tech has been playing around with various replacements (and levels of caffeine). I have used several of these products, and have been generally satisfied with the results (stacking with other products, it should be noted). This version ""hardcore elite"" is the first to actually keep me up at night if I take it after 3 or 4 pm, leading me to believe the caffeine or related product is on time release delayed that long. I'm no expert, but simply my own empirical experience has me preferring previous Hydroxycut products more."
2,"I received a sample from bodybuilding.com. This sample says to take two pills and says nothing about taking one pill the first day to assess your tolerance BUT on the MuscleTech website and the actual product it says start with one. I wish I knew this prior to my girlfriend taking two, because she felt like crap. Her heart was beating rapidly only minutes after taking it, her eyes were bloodshot, and she threw up multiple times. Poor labeling is a serious issue. Good luck trying to contact the company. I still have not found contact information for them."
2,"This is only my personal review but I found that this pill did nothing for me... actually, i'm pretty sure it had the opposite effect. I found myself extremely drowsy, unmotivated and having trouble focusing. On top of that, and this might be worse as it's a DIET pill, I was more hungry than before I started taking it! I would eat a full breakfast and be STARVING within the hour. I'm a Weightwatchers member and despite the fact that I have been following the diet I have not lost a single pound, in the past I would have lost MORE than I am while taking the Hydroxycut Hardcore. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and took it for two weeks but am finally frustrated enough to give it up and pass it along to someone else that it might work for. In the past I have taken the Hydroxycut Advanced and it worked very well, if you can I would buy that instead."
2,"Hi guys, I started using this 2 days ago and I took during first day 1 in the morining, half an hour before breakfast in 10AM, didnt feel a thing. Next I took after 5hours in 3PM, and I went to lunch half an hour after. Nothing happend...I was hungry as usual and thats like every 3-4 hours if I eat around 500kcal per meal, and I eat 4-5 times per day with snacks. Around 2000-3000kcal per day. It depends of conditions and what I do during the day. I m 6' 4"" and I weight 225-230 pounds in the morning. Around 25-30 pounds of extra weight, with 200 I m lean muscles. Anyway I didnt feel a thing so I increased to 1 in the morining and 2 around 2PM and same thing...nothing... My female cousin took these and told me they had no effect on her as well :-) I m gonna continue using them and report it over here... I had same experience with one other fat burner 4-5yrs ago but I cant remember name now..."
2,I use a lot of diet supplements and this ranks near the bottom of the list. Never felt like it did any good and made me very nauseous.
2,"...after only a single recommended dose. Why? I experienced hypertension, dizziness, intense sweating, and other transient shock symptoms. In addition, the type on the label is VERY small, even under rather ordinary magnification. QED: check the ingredients and proceed with care and caution. If at all."
2,"I was offered these for free and since I'm not a guy, I gave it to a friend I work with who was desperate to lose weight. I'll never do that again.Within the hour he had a racing heart, headache, tremors, and was very sick to his stomach. After running around the office, he gave them back saying he'd never touch these things again. I promptly flushed them down the toilet.I've read where different people have different reactions so maybe he was just too sensitive. But if you're not sure how you'd react, I would never ever buy Hardcore Elite for any of my loved ones."
2,"This did nothing for me and i take my supplements as directed, regularly. I was using 6 per day as was my husband, and there was no change in weight. He was incorporating diet changes, i was using diet and exercise changes."
2,"I started this product three days ago. It makes me feel full all the time! Which is great! It also gives me energy to make it through the day! And also through the night... I've slept 5 hours in the last 48 hours and I'm still wide awake. And I am not in any way an insomniac. It also gives me the jitters so bad I start shaking. I love the appetite suppressant part, but sleep is really sounding good right now."
2,I've been working out a lot lately and wanted to try and find a pre workout supplement that would give me a lil energy and burn fat at the same time. the first time I took this stuff I damn near felt like I was going to have a heart attack!!
2,I used hydroxycut in addition to exercise and eating a little better 7 years ago and had awesome results when I hit a plateau. I used both this and this series and the traditional one for several months and have had zero luck with either. When I first started taking them I was also jittery if I took them right before exercising but that stopped after a few days. Would definitely not recommend.
2,"I'm one of those who cannot tolerate this drug. I've had terrible side effects after one dose including rapid heart beat, nausea, and vomiting. I've successfully used similar drugs in the past, but there must be something in this formula that does not react well to my body. To say the least. Never again."
2,"The first three years were wonderful. The Trakstand Fluid trainer was a big improvement over my first two trainers. I solved the problem everyone mentions - the wheel tensioner loosening up after a few minutes - by butting the end against the wall. I do 100+ hours a year, and was using it almost everyday. Yesterday, the resistance suddenly increased, and I couldn't bicycle any more. Performance bicycle said the bearings were shot, and I could feel the difference. I can't find the receipt. It's been 3 or 4 years, and I don't know what the warranty was. Could have been one year, five year, or lifetime. I guess I will upgrade to CycleOps Fluid 2, at double the cost $300 vs $150 (or $175)."
2,"...but the rest, definitely VERY TIRED. Patsy deserves much better than this, so buy one of her discs instead."
2,"The ""victim"" approach is not acceptable when you're a discovered liar. This book is nothing more than an attempt to blame the entire Blair disaster on something or someone other than himself. His actions are because he is black, pressured, a drug user, depressed, etc. Reality should set in now, he did what he did because he is a sociopathic liar. If you want to read a book that gives you insight into nothing, this is a good choice."
2,"He conned the New York Times. Don't let him con you, too. (...)The book is riddled with other misrepresentations and errors, great and small, from misspelled names to wrong dates to mistakes that are simply pathetic: For example, he mocks the Times for running a feature about ""orchards"" found in Central Park. He means orchids.Blair's inability to get facts straight casts doubt on the accuracy of his book's paragraph-long quotations from long-ago conversations. Especially since we're asked to believe that Blair was drug-addled, mentally unstable and blacked out much of the time. And even that part of his tale is hard to believe.This book also fails on a more fundamental level: It is badly written and boring, full of long digressions unrelated to his main story. I pity anyone who actually tries to listen to the 10-hour audio version. For Blair, it is yet another dubious achievement: a book that is both evil and dull. Perhaps he should consider another line of work."
2,"I'm sorry I'm all for supporting UK urban music but I really cant see how Dizzie is getting all the respect he is. Firstly this is a garage album plain and simple, if you like conscious Hip Hop you wont like this. Yes his style is original and fresh but as a Hip Hop fan you simply cant ignore the production. Much better UK Urban music out there, sorry."
2,"Much ado about nothing!-- just a lot of fluff and filler and general rambling about family life. From my standpoint (and I am an aunt seven times), there wasn't anything in this book to recommend having bought it. I feel that I wasted my money."
2,"It's been about two weeks since I first received my Studio DV V8. Installation was fairly straight forward. I notice the quality of the IEEE-1394 PCI card was more on the low cost side and the IEEE-1394 6-pin/4-pin cable fit very loosely into my Sony DV. When I start the capture, computer lock-up and I have to cycle the power to get out of it.- There are no 800 numbers for phone tech support and tech support hours are 10-7 EST M-F; which can't be utilized by me.- I had logged this problem with them twice via web support in the last two weeks and had not heard anything from them.(I will update the review if I ever get an answer back from them.)"
2,Someone else here has no picture...well I have no sound. Sound works out of the headphone jack but not from the built-in speakers. We've had it for about 9 months and it's always been kept in a case and rarely moved from the back seat of the car. It does get VERY hot and you need to be careful not to just shut the movie off and close the top as it's really NOT OFF. It has no auto-shut off so very early on I discovered it would continue to spin away until you actually turn the physical switch off unlike a notebook computer etc. Also the controls are terrible in layout and design. Even the volume switch is reverse of the intuitive motion. When sitting in front of the unit you would think upwards is louder...not according to Magnavox designers! No up is down and down is up. Outstanding!
2,"It's certainly an OK bag though I don't find it particularly well-made. The material of the bag is very lite and thin, not exactly what I had in mind. The straps and buckles were very unimpressive, cheap-looking, and hard to work. Additionally, it's relatively small but does what it should --- hold stuff. That's about all it has going for it aside from looking neat (from far off, I suppose.) All-in-all, I did not feel like the product was worth the price and it seemed to be made from very cheap materials. Wouldn't recommend it for others. Pay the extra money for a better bag."
2,"This not my first cable stapler. I used a PowerFast for many, many years, but I can't get the staples anymore.I have been trying to use the GB stapler on romex (12-2 NM). The stapler jams and misfires often. I have to take the staples out of the stapler and take out the cable guide to clear the jam. I waste the last 3 or 4 staples on each stick. It just won't feed them. I estimate that I waste at least 1/3 of each stick due to jams and not feeding.The last time I used it, I wasted far more staples than I used. I took it out of my van so that I am not tempted anymore. It is just too frustrating!"
2,"I've been using this stapler to secure both data cables and camera cables for almost three years off and on. Too frequently the staples either don't sink completely, or worse, they bend/kink toward the cable, potentially damaging the cable - requiring repair our replacement of the cable before you're even done installing it.That said, it's no worse than any other cable stapler i've used - they all suck, and too often cause visible damage to the cable."
2,"This is by far the worst bathroom tissue I ever bought, it sticks everywhere do not buy this even if they give it for free..not worth even a penny"
2,"This book is only practice questions. There aren't even any detailed explanations. The questions are helpful, but you'll need another book like foundations of finacial mangement by Hirt and Block to pass the dantes test."
2,"I was OK with Studio 8 for the first few months I had it, I made simple VCDs and DVDs of my friends, it was amusing.Then I tried to make some more complicated things, with multi-level menus, and a number of different file types, and fill up the whole DVD. I ended up with about 5 coasters. The pinnacle tech support was no help at all.Then I found TMPG DVD Author, used to make DVD files which are then burned from within the program or burned with Nero. TMPG has not produced any coasters yet. Now I do all my editing/transitions with Studio 8, render it, and use TMPG to actually make the DVD.So all in all, I had to spend an extra $90 for a REAL dvd authoring progam to go along with Studio 8."
2,"Worked for 1.5 days, then just stopped, despite the fact that we didn't drop it, spill anything on it, or otherwise do anything that could cause any damage! Tried using BRAND NEW DVDs, and it wouldn't play them. Don't waste your time or your money!!!"
2,"Mark Dery's writing style makes my mind wander and fails to pull me in. He mentions something about everything, from Ace Ventura's anal speech to the burning of Waco. ""The Pyrotechnic Insanitarium: American Culture on the Brink"" gives short insight into life's odd episodes, freak shows, and moments of insanity but misses out on making a statement worthy of reaction. As I read, I kept thinking, ""yes, I know, so what?"" Give me something, anything. I guess was expecting more."
2,I'm a true reader.....I read over 20 books a week....Take my word for it....Borrow it don't buy it....This book was a diappointment....
2,"I have 3 complaints about this machine: No fast forward feature for the DVD player, takes too long to start up, the clock always runs fast.Our biggest complaint is that there is no fast forward feature for the DVD player. You are allowed to skip chapters, but once in a chapter you can not fast forward or rewind. This is very annoying.Our second complaint is that it takes forever to initially start up. It is so slow! You can't just turn it on and record, you have to let the maching boot itself up first. And it is noisy.Our last complaint is that regardless of how many times you reset the clock, it will always run fast. We've given up on it at this point.I agree with the other review that says the machine is somewhat difficult to run. You definately have to read the manual through to figure it out.This machine will play both DVD's and Tapes, but it is more hassel then it it worth. I wish I would have researched this before I bought it, it was an impulse buy."
2,"I love true crime and I have read many. This was one of the worst books I have ever read. Some of the situations are so ridiculously portrayed, you know they are exaggerated, if at all true. Every character fits into overused fictionalized story stereotypes. Imagine the worst Lifetime TV Movie, and it would be worse than that. To top it off, there are several descriptions of these two people, whom no one would want to imagine naked, in intimate moments described in typical romance-novel fashion. The bonus is the ""love"" poem, written by the victim, sounding more like the prose of a third grader. Such a waste of what could have been an interesting story."
2,"The item is described as ""10 mm Pink Genuine Pearl..."" These are NOT genuine pearls. These are simulated pearls. Swarovski does make simulated pearls, these might be those simulated pearls or other simulated pearls. Quite honestly, considering the description is inaccurate, I doubt the crystal is even really Swarovski elements. It feels much more plastic-like than my genuine Swarovski items. The earrings are cute, but not the deal you might think considering the misleading title.I own three other pairs of pink pearl earrings, and bought these to replace a pair that was lost. Although these are nice, they don't quite wow me like I thought they would considering all the five star reviews."
2,"I thought it would be bigger, like 12"" or so was I disappointed. I waited and when package arrived it was a small med sized envelope. I just looked at it and said no way. This can't be it. There is no way they could fit it into this envelope. Low and behold there it was cute but very small. There was no size listed that gave me an indication what the size was. I bought this from paradise through amazon. I will be more careful in the future. Wasted $20 includign shipping."
2,"It makes 2 months that I got this compact unit. Warms good the space BUT it already started to fail. at the beginning, works well, but after a few minutes starts to try to blow the air and stops, like 4 times/second. Product warranty says to ship the product to them with the shipping and handling check or money order included. I paid 14 bucks forthe unit and to send it to warranty service will cost me around 11 bucks. Doesn't worth it. Also, ina cold season, 4 months or 5, I will have to be spending 28 dolars in appliance every cold season. Better get a reliable brand and paying a little bit more for a long lasting unit."
2,"This heater has a great price but several flaws:1. The thermostat is so sensitive that the heater comes on and shuts off about every 30 seconds.2. When it turns on it dims light and you here an electrical arc. Other space heaters used at the same location do not have the dimming effect.3. Very little heat production. You can keep your hand right against this heater and it is luke warm at best.4. The tilt sensor arcs out whenever activated.5. When my toddler jumps up and down on the floor he often causes the heater to stop or start.Returned it to Amazon for a refund, we went with the Honeywell HZ-370GP and it is 100%"
2,"The heat output was great, construction was as expected, but this was WAY too loud for office use. Sent it back and did trial and error with 2 other units at Wal-mart...still haven't found a very quiet one."
2,I can't believe I did not see anyone else with the problem I have had with the shipping! I had to return the speaker 2 times because each time the speaker was popped out of its casing. This was due to the box being dropped on its face during shipping. the original box and packing is not made for being dropped and the Amazon box it was shipped in hardly had any packing at all. some brown packing paper was thrown in. what really gets me going is this was done the same way 4 times! I bought 2 and one of the 2 came in OK. I had the 2nd one replaced 2 times and after receiving the 3rd one in the same damaged condition I just gave up and screwed the speaker back in rotating it a few inches to grab some press wood. I don't think this will last long since the press wood is pretty beaten up but I have to use the speakers this weekend for a function otherwise I would just return them for a refund.
2,"My problem with this product was that the speaker was blown before i ever used it, and that to me ment that the product was not tested before being packed up, the cage was bent in out of the box and the box it came in was not broken so it was obviously packed up that way, disappointed."
2,"It's really unfortunate that the performance on this CD does seem to sound too sharp as pointed out by a previous reviewer, who's a Suzuki teacher. Our violins (both mine and my daugther's) always sound quite a bit flatter than this CD after being tuned by my daughter's Suzuki teacher, who has perfect pitch. One time earlier on, I also tried tuning our violins w/ this CD as aid (thinking our violins had gone too flat), and the teacher thought they were oddly out of tune more than usual (or in an odd way I guess since they were sharp, not flat) -- well, she didn't really say so, but her facial expression and gesture said it all. :-) I never really brought this up w/ her before, but I think I will in our next lesson. And perhaps, I'll buy a different CD for this series as well -- maybe the David Nadien version as suggested elsewhere."
2,"Sorry for the 1 star, but I'm reading all your reviews and seems that everyone reviewing the CD and some even reviewing volume 1 book. I am looking at the title and it is the book for violin part, volume 6. I'm totally confused..."
2,The tuning dial is too rough grain; it is hard to fine-tune a station. Additionally even for FM signals broadcast nearby the reception is very sketchy; fine one minute then with a slight change of position it goes to near complete static. Virtually useless device.
2,"It was a gift for my mom and she doesnt like because it has alot of static and she can't listen to her favorite radio station, I am very disappointed."
2,The radio is functional but you have to be a really calm person to get the station you want. The dial is real tricky..
2,"I have to admit, it took me two tries to finish this book. The first time I got bogged down in all the descriptions, cussing and cast. The second half was better than the first - once you make contact with the alien and feel its presence in the ""zombies"" it began to make more sense. It's not the worst book I've ever read, and I will definitely try at least one more book by this author, but I don't feel this is a good one to read first. (Also - is there anyone actually happy in this book? If there is, I didn't find them...)"
2,"I agree with Kathleen's description of this book.IF you (the woman) entered marriage without any sexual scars of your own, and IF you're pretty clueless as to how the male mind works regarding sexual stimulation, then this book might be helpful. But, as one who's hurting both from my husband's problem (which I'm all too familiar with) and my own past, wading through all the horror stories of what various men have done just set my mind off on negative tracks.I slogged through the first two or three chapters, thought, ""this is not helpful;"" so I skipped ahead thinking I'd get to the ""now this is what you do about it"" part, but it was more of the same.I would not recommend this book to most women.BTW, the ""Every Man's Battle"" book has been very helpful for my husband. Another book I think he'd recommend is ""False Intimacy"" by Schaumburg."
2,"The Speaker on this phone did not work for me. I was told by the receiving end that I sounded like I was speaking underwater or that I sounded very far away when speaking on the speaker. I was sent two telephones by this company. I had requested that they not send me another phone. I still had one delivered against my request. Both of the telephones did not work for me due to the defective speaker. I was credited back the amount due, less shipping in handling for the first telephone. In my opinion this was not right due to the phone being defective."
2,"For the class work my daughter's school is currently doing, this book is more like 3rd grade. It needs more examples to teach kids. Compared to the kind of class work my daughter's school is currently doing this book did not work for us. I'll save it for son who is younger."
2,"Against my better instincts I bought this CD hoping that maybe Jimmy had gotten a little of the old spark back from the days before major disappointments like ""Banana Wind"" and ""Beach House On The Moon"". I should have listened to my instincts. ""Capecodadgirl"" and Jennifer from Phoenix are right on target. He's just mailing it in and laughing all the way to the bank like he has been doing since his last GOOD CD ""Barometer Soup"" and that was about ten years ago. I'm with you Jennifer. Give me any of Bill Jabanoski's CDs over this one. Buffett sounds about as interested in his performance as he is in his audience, meaning Not At All. What happened to you, Jimmy? You used to be great. Now you're more interested in being Jimmy Buffett the Fortune 500 Corporation than you are in your music."
2,"I recently had my Leatherman Micra confiscated at the airport (forgot to put it in my checked luggage and they don't allow such things as carry-on items anymore!), so I headed to target to purchase a replacement Micra as I use it frequently at work.I saw the Gerber shortcut at almost half the price and had heard Gerber made a good multitool, so I gave it a shot.Bad idea! The scissors especially is much weaker and has a lot of trouble cutting through things the micra just tore through. Especially plastic loading straps. The gerber scissors 'bounce' off the loading straps more often than not, and often get dislocated trying to make a cut. Whereas the Leatherman micra could often cut two at a time.This one LOOKS cooler, but does not handle the same workload. Decide what is more important to you."
2,"Sadly, this compilation does not contain all original hits. I tested ""Midnight Confessions"" against an original recording (and my memory), and this cassette failed the test. It's possible that other songs on the cassette are original hits, but I doubt it.FYI: I am a long time record collector (over 50 years) and sometimes deejay. The Roots were one of my favorite groups."
2,"I agree 100% with the previous reviewers, even at the inexpensive price of the CD, it was not worth 1 penny--I love the Grass Roots but threw it away! It sounded horrible, even on cheap computer speakers."
2,"When I lived in Hong Kong in the 90's I loved reading books like these. This one should be great; the problem is not the subject matter, but simply the flat, dull prose and tortured arguments. Aside from a small section of nice black and white photos I can't say anything good about it. Readers interested in this fascinating city may wish to try Harriet Sergeant's Shanghai, which at least is far better written (I'm not sure the other reviewer here read Wei's book or Sergeant's - it is the latter that is full of ""wonderful anecdotes,"" I think - this one is a mediocre academic text). Another good book is W.H. Auden & Christopher Isherwood's A Journey to a War, which deals with a 1930's journey the two British poets made to China and includes a fascinating section on Shanghai, as well as Canton and Hong Kong, and includes Auden's poem ""Hong Kong,"" which should be the anthem of that city."
2,"harrison ford is playing a over the hill grandfather of a cop in his 60's moon lighting as a realestate salesman and the handsome josh harnett playing the doof partner.get a real storey with substance, harrison ford does have a fan base, but stay away from the hip hop element or sound track, it just annoys people seeing that in a theatre.harrison ford get a face lift, ya look like a worn out old man !"
2,"I'll simply say, skip it. This movie had great potential. I thought this was going to be a fun cop buddy picture. Between the convuluted story to the truly appalling dialogue and right on to the dreadful editing, I cannot find anything good to say about it. I spent much of the movie trying to figure out what was going on, Gavilan (Ford) has two jobs, Calden (Hartnett) has two jobs and a dream to be an actor, and on the side they are LAPD Homicide detectives trying to solve the murders of an up and coming rap group. It should have been a drama or a comedy, not tried to be both. I have great respect for Harrison Ford. All I can think of is that he needed some money to pay for something or there is no good reason he would have chosen this project. Skip this one and get one of Harrison's good movies. Your time will be much better spent watching Frantic, any Indiana Jones movie, or Patriot Games."
2,I'm not sure this movie was even worth the rental. It was really boring and moved extremely slow. The way the jokes came across was as if you knew the characters your whole life. It seems the movie expected you to already know everyone like it's Lethal Weapon 5. My advice: skip it and move on.
2,"I LOVE Harrison Ford and have over 15 of his movies on DVD. I wouldn't own this DVD for anything, this is a terrible movie and the leads have no chemistry together, constant awkwardness, Josh is silly...I would not see this movie again. All of Harrison's other movies I watch over and over and fall in love with again and again. This movie was a waste of his time and creative energy. I really wouldn't even give it 1 star."
2,"Received promptly in appropriate packaging. The DVD playing surface appeared unusual but there were no cracks or other obvious damage. It played fine with one exception. It would not start at the beginning of the disk when inserted, it started wherever it had stopped when last viewed. This means you must ""fast-reverse"" whenever you insert the disc to get to the beginning (same as a VCR tape). Since the disc was relatively inexpensive and I dont watch it often, I kept it. In the future, I'll buy new DVDs.From the story perspective, its a light comedy and, while not very deep, I found it very entertaining. I'm happy with the storyline but not the disc condition."
2,Harrison Ford (with or without his ear ring) needs a hit. HOLLYWOOD HOMICIDE (Columbia Tristar) isn't it. Talk about unintended title irony.
2,"Awful....just plain awful. No plot, no humor, no excitement, no nothing. Don't waste your time or money. If I could have rated this movie zero stars, I would have."
2,"Maximillian Schell likes to put himself at the center of his supposed biographies of others -- the recent one on his sister/actress Maria Schell (MY SISTER MARIA) and this earlier one on Marlene Dietrich.This one dwells and dwells on his trials with the willful, aging icon during this film's making. It's probably the foregrounding of those behind-the-scenes irrelevancies that the critics admired about this film. There isn't much room, however, for detail, so it winds up a pretty flimsy biography.Max should have followed Marlene's simple formula for a biography. She tells him right there in the interview. But he may not have been paying attention."
2,"I had a Lava Tamp. I dropped it. It broke.Enter the RSVP tamper. It looks almost like the Lava Tamp. It says commercial. It fits my commercial machine.Unfortunately, this tamper sucks. I like a convex, not flat tamper, but this is too convex.The main problem is the weight. It's the same weight as an aluminum tamper, but it's distributed all wrong.Don't be fooled by the fact this says ""commercial."" It is not.It's probably fine for the occasional home barista, but for anyone serious about coffee, it's basically a paperweight."
2,"I was very exited when I saw the order at my door. When I open it and put it on, the frame is soooooo small. My eyes hurt, because the goggle is just trying to squeeze your eye balls out. The products should state that this is just for children or people with small faces. The quality itself is good."
2,"As expected the AudioStation sounds very good. However, there are some functional problems that ruin the experience. On the unit both volume controls turn down the sound level. Every time the iPod is turned on while in the Audiostation it defaults to shuffle mode, regardless of how you left it. The power supply brick was unexpected (I hate them) and it's too loose fitting; the plug falls out with the slightest nudge. I have no idea how this product made it through the quality control department!!! Shame on Logitech - drop this failure and start over!"
2,Bought this after reading all the past problems. It worked great straight out of the box from Tigerelectronics then 12 days later it started making banging noises from the speakers and the display flashed and failed and then no functions. This one had a late 07 date code so it seems the same old problems are still there...great shame as it sounded great when it was working.Just returned it for a refund at my expense $15...not very happy about that!Logitech AudioStation iPod Speaker System
2,"Way too repetitious, it's the same thing over and over, ""let's get lost"" is just the same notes played over and over for about four minutes, the only track that has any groove to it is ""drum company"" because it changes patterns several times, but even it gets old after six minutes. some of the other tracks have a tribal feel to them, but again, it's always the same thing and they all end up sounding alike (like the same deep voice in ""feel my drums"" is used again in ""AC/DC""). overall, this is a pretty bad CD...."
2,"Hi, i brought tihis CD on Dec. 15 of 2006!!!!!! and my cd don't arrive to my office....."
2,"I purchased this product, but had to exchange it because the part to tighten the item in place was made of plastic and smushed apart when tighted to the end. The problem happened after the 30 day return so I had no alternative, but to exchange instead of return for credit. I'm cautious with the new one and don't tighten to the end. Great design in theory, but they need to use stronger materials to prevent this from happening again."
2,"Author Joan Mellen asked me if she could interview me for a book on Jim Garrison, the former DA of New Orleans who investigated the assassination of JFK. I worked for Garrison as a photo-analyst. Joan Mellen spent hours interviewing me in my home. I gave her information that had never been seen or revealed. She distorted the information and attacked me on a personal level though she never indicated that she was going to do that, I suppose because she thought I wouldn't grant her an interview. While I respected and admired Garrison's work, Mellen attributed to me things I never said. She annotated some of her statements but not some that were attacks on me. How serious can you take a book written by someone so irresponsibly?"
2,This seems to be more a compilation of facts and rumor presented in a sort of kaleidoscopic manner. Some points were very ineresting but lost in the chaos.
2,"Purchased this product two weeks ago based on other reviewer recommendations and upon receiving it, it didn't work. I called Amcor which is what the manual says to do in bold print instead of returning to the store. After patiently dealing with a series of stupid questions, I was told this would be elevated to a technician to call me back. Never heard from them again. Logged onto Amazon returned the item and asked for a new one. Received the second one yesterday. The item appeared to be previously used and the drainage hose wasn't included in the box. Plugged it in and it worked for about an hour and then quit. Checked the settings and everything was set correctly. I will have to call Amcor again today, Ugh. The lack of customer service Amcor provides should be reason enough for anyone not to buy this unit."
2,"Stay away, the Amcor dehumidifier fan option of low/high only worked on low, then the fan quit altogether and overheated. When I called the manufacturer for help, they said to call around to find someone to work on it. When I went thru the phone book to find someone to work on an Amcor product, they all said they can't and cannot get parts for it. so I am stuck with a broken product. It's pretty bad when the manufacturer won't help. Look for a different brand!!!!!!"
2,"The unit constantly over heats and then burned up the fan motor. The humidty and temperature sensor are in a terrible location, and when it started overheating it unit always displayed the temperature as 90 some degrees (and this was in a basement). Don't waste your time or money."
2,"The hit song, Scorpio, is not the original version on this CD and it sounds like something recorded in the basement of a crack house. Quite frankly, I have never been more disappointed with a CD I purchased from Amazon -- and I've purchased hundreds of them -- than this one. Don't waste your money."
2,"I received this watch approximately 2 weeks ago, it is of very poor quality. The leather band is already showing signs of wear on the inside with cracks forming in it. The hands look very cheap as well. The first time I hit it on my desk a big chunk of the shiny case came off revealing a dull metal underneath. This shows it is not a ss case as claimed. I would return it but the policy states it can only be returned in like new condition. I have had throw away watches that were of better quality! I could not recommend this watch to anyone. I own 3 Invictas and have been very pleased with all of them, my big mistake was to try another brand in that price range. I will stick with Invicta in the future as they all have been high quality and look much more expensive than they are."
2,"This is a lovely bird house, but if you want to use it outdoors, then think again. Even in a place where it gets just some morning sun, it has deteriorated in way less than a year. It looks well built, but the wood is not good for outdoors, eventhough I used an application to prevent early destruction of this product. Steer clear if for outdoors!"
2,Agree completely with first reviewer. Useless until new files are available.
2,"This book uses evidence provided by US govenment intelligence agencies to prove that US government intelligence agencies were justified in investigating and prosecuting critics of policies made by US government intelligence agencies. For books which make similar arguments but are more convincing by virtue of their use of other sources of info, try the work of Allen Weinstein, Ron Radosh, or Ellen Schrecker."
2,"I purchased this faucet in June 2009, paying $196 for it and had a licensed contractor install it because of inadequate installation instructions. Within 6 months, it began leaking at the base and I had to have an 0 ring replaced . Within 9 months, the finish began eroding at the base of the faucet and on the handle. Shortly afterwards, the faucet froze and would no longer swivel. I replaced it with a Moen."
2,"another freakout version, what is up with awful songs turning upwith different covers every year. and at a 1000.00 dollars , wow what a deal...not.. dont buy anything with these songs on it."
2,"Contrary to the previous review, I don't find Ms.Airey that proficient in Photoshop. Much of her artistic successes come from ""Happy Surprises"" in experimenting with various software and hardware. Which brings me to my next point. Be prepared to spend $1,000+ on such things as Nik Color Effects, AutoFX Photographic Edges, Wacom tablets and last but not least Studio Artist, which is only made for a Mac. So you'll need a Mac too if you want to try any of her ""experiments"". Nearly half the book is devoted to ""Studio Artist"" Inserts written by her compatriate artists use photoshop more than Ms. Airey. Some of her techniques are ""way out there"". I may as well bought a book written by Rembrandt on ""How to Paint Pictures"""
2,"Well, I shouldve done more research on this book, but I don't like it because it requires too many other things to be used other than oragami paper. And sometimes the images of the pictures didnt seem very accurate, so i got confused a lot."
2,Bought these because I thought they were the same ones I already had. Boy was I wrong. The ones I have are the Safety First brand. These are much cheaper quality and don't stay on baby's hands.
2,Too dark and boring selection to listen to.......Only two of the songs worth listening to again.......
2,"Prince is good on his cover of Case of You (although my 3 yr old made the comment that he sounded more like a Princess, he is singing so high!, still, it was interesting, and the more I listen to his version the more I like it.Sarah McLaughlin's version of Blue is good, but it's old. I've heard her do it before. Same with James Taylor and River.Emmy Lou Harris's version of Magdalene Laundry is good.The rest is unbearable. REALLY. Unbearable.I am a die hard Joni fan, and I was very disappointed with this purchase."
2,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie, my friend told me he saw a new Van Damme flick in the video store titled 'Derailed'. I am a Van Damme Fan, but after getting this film on DVD it hit me like a book it was horrible! It was pathetic....it SUCKED! I own Under Seige 2 and I liked it, there is NO COMPARISON. What hurt the most is how happy I was when I got the DVD, and how much I was looking foward to seeing it before and after I got it.Derailed is the worst Van Damme movie AND the worst MOVIE I have ever seen and yes I am also a Van Damme fan.Jean really stuffed up BIG TIME with this flick.On another note, Van Damme's son starred in this movie aswell, he is a good lookin' kid, has his fathers good looks and skills.Jean should be ashamed of himself! Putting his son in a terrible first flick like this.0 star film:-EXTREMELY OVER-RATED BY THE LOOK OF THE DVD/VIDEO COVER.DONT BE FOOLED.In conclusion, dont even pick up or look at the packet if you see it in a store."
2,Derailed is something like a bad TV action soap opera...THis movie is a shame.
2,"This has got to be the worst movie I've ever seen.If you find this DVD on the street, just keep walking."
2,"For better or worse, this mat does not emit or radiate any heat - if you hold your hand an inch above the surface, you can't feel any temp difference. But if you place your hand on the surface, it's warm. Just my two cents if you are considering what you would be using it for."
2,"This book is absolute trash, with no other way to describe it. All this book does is provoke fear and put the average American into a coldwar like mentality as to expect a war with China, which is the last thing any country in the world wants right now or ever. I don't know anything about the author, but I can bet he is probably a Bush supporter, as he uses fear mongering as a strategy to sell a piece of trash work."
2,"The cast list for this movie is actually for a 1994 Family Channel version of the same title. While I can't say anything for the animated movie, the Good King Wenceslas tv movie was extremely enjoyable."
2,I'm hoping there is a much better dvd of Barry out there. This was seems like it was almost like a rehearal show. I was rather disappointed in this show.
2,The cover of this book had been duct taped across the front and on the bottom edge; although the description stated that it was like new. I am okay with the inside of the book but the condition of the outside with the duct tape on it has prevented me from selling it back. Will not buy from this seller again.
2,"I just dont' know why it's the most popular item in this category,this is the only reason I was persuaded to buy it.the only useful part are the hex sets, but you can get a 10-piece, must stronger set from home-depot. all the other stuff are useless, and, worse, damage your bike: the open-end 10mm wrench does not lock on bolts, and easily strips the bolts. 15gauge spoke wrench also strips the bolts on my spokes. since these ""wrenches"" are made by punching the hexagon shapes on a flimsy 1-mm steel plate, the ""mouth"" of the wrench has a curved edge on one side, so the edge is not flat, and has very little gripping power.so my suggestion is to buy a normal allen wrench set / hex set, plus a set of closed-end wrenches with ""stopping gear (bi-directional) "", and a ring-shaped spoke wrench, with 6 openings."
2,"This DVD just has to be one of the most lazy recent music compilations released.The videos: The omission of Sex Crime and Julia may be explained due to contractual issues, the songs being released on Virgin. Still, that was not a problem a few years back when the original compilation was released, Shame. There are additionally so many other songs missing (not a single one from We Two Are One), Shame.Sound: I thought my system had broken down. There is no surround sound here folks. Actually, it is muffled and seems to be concentrated on the central speaker, Shame.Footage transfer: It's alright, but could have been better, Shame.Other features: There aren't any, Shame.The content itself has stood the test of time, both musically and visually. As a product, however, this is a major let down. Did I mention that there is no Shame?"
2,"I really wanted to love this spatula and have been wanting to buy it since Cook's Illustrated gave it rave reviews in 2008. It is very stiff and way too big for my hand and I'm known for my long piano hands. The white blade is huge and as such I find it awkward to manoeuvre: scraping down a bowl or folding ingredients isn't easily done with this spatula unlike my other smaller mmore flexible silicone ones. The handle has a sharp raised ridge on either side and is uncomfortable to hold. I wish I had purchased the smaller 9 1/2"" model; not sure it would be that much better, although it would likely be easier to use."
2,"I was looking for a more diverse spaula, thinner and more flexible. This one is 3/16"" thick at the thinest point and quite stiff, way too stiff to use for med/small cans jars. I'm really not sure how I could use it actually!.. maybe scraping something like a large bowl or casserole dish using lots and lots of pressure. I went to a physical store to find what I wanted and went with a Calphalon set (Calphalon 2pc Silicone Scraper Set, for ten bux), much better for my needs!"
2,The concept of this wall mop by Rubbermaid is great (using Velcro hook/loop to attach/detach the mop pad from the handle base)....but that's all it has in terms of positive points.The Velcro pad DOES NOT evenly attach to the flat base on the stick properly...so what happens is that the ends of the pad are left hanging and eventually fold inside as you struggle to mop. All you end up with is a lot of frustration as it's a really bad and flimsy design.Since the plastic Velcro base doesn't hold down the pads down securely I am now left with a lot of scratches and dents in my wall all thanks to the exposed plastic base of the mop.Short Story: Bad product design = bad for your walls.P.S. I was washing my walls with an anti-allergen to denature dander from my walls....if you really wanted to know.
2,I choose this unit because of the zoom mirror and the light on it. Worked great before I installed it. Once I installed and used it one the light would not turn off and the unit never got wet.
2,"1. Received the product, inserted batteries, and after one test the zoom stopped working. Ok, I can live without the zoom.2. One month of use and the lights stopped working.3. Insert product in trash can where it belongs.Why did I buy this? Pure junk, a waste of $70+ dollars."
2,"I am rating this as one star, not because of the quality of the jointer, but because of the terrible customer service. When researching what jointer to buy, all I read was how great other companies customer service was. I figured I was safe going with a well known brand like Jet. Well, once I purchased this jointer, I was not necessarily dismayed that a few pieces were damaged beyond repair - they were simple pieces not totaling more than $25.00 to replace.However after having been passed by their customer service from service center, to retailer, and back to service center, I decided to just buy the parts myself. I have never contacted a group of people more eager to pass me off to someone else. If you do decide to purchase this brand, I just hope it arrives without issues."
2,"I bought this watch in August 2007, and I was very pleased with the overall appearance. However, I soon discovered I could not wear the watch every day--the leather watchband acquired a really obnoxious, foul odour after a couple of hours of wear. The leather reacted with the perspiration from my wrist. I usually have metal watchbands, but this watch was so handsome with its black leather and studs that I didn't try to change it. I have discovered there is such a thing as a 'waterproof' wristband that doesn't smell. Stuhrling could have waterproofed their leather watchband, which would have prevented the problem in the first place. I'm rather unhappy about having to shell out money to correct an avoidable problem."
2,"I'm disappointed with this watch, its quality is very bad, the belt and the case are made with materials of a lower price watch, }I do not recommend it!Estoy decepcionado con este reloj, su calidad es muy mala, la correa y la caja estan hechas con materiales de un reloj de menor precio, no lo recomiendo"
2,The sound quality is lacking a great deal. The cd of the concert offers better sound quality but on the upside this contains the original videos for the last 3 songs and the video quality is good. My advise is to buy the cd.
2,This is a joke workout. We do not recommend you buy it.A Latin rhythm workout. Ok maybe it has some really bad latin rhythms but the workout is a pure USA aerobic workout. Justbecouse you name some USA aerobic steps with latin dance names does not make it a latin dance workout.This video is a real disappointment.The aerobic workout itself is a very good length. But do not think it has anything really to do with latin dance.Vanessa's Afro Brazilian Dance Workout with Vanessa Isaac has much more latin steps in it.
2,"This is more of a blog that the author published. I was hoping for more detailed instructions. Secondly, half of the book is personal testmonies for the selected people that have tried this progam. Over all I would say this book adds little value and you should probably buy the origional book."
2,"We really wanted this paper towel holder to work. It is all one piece, sturdy, and a very nice stainless steel--which would have worked well in our kitchen. However, the bit about ""allows for quick replacement of emptied rolls"" is misleading. We spent 3-5 minutes trying to wiggle one of our paper towel rolls into it- before realizing that it was not made for large paper towel rolls. We returned it."
2,"Although it is well made and nice looking, there is no spring tension at all. One must completely deform the roll of paper towels in order to insert it into position."
2,"I wish I had paid more attention to the one and two star reviews regarding this product. Yes, it's a beautiful stainless steel look, but good design it is NOT! The holder is so rigid you have to cram the roll into place, which ends up mangling the cardboard, creating a very off balance situation. Because of this, one has to really pull at the paper towel, many times causing it to rip just a small piece off at a time. The holder was only $16 bucks so it's not worth returning, and I'm actually still using it (I'm lazy, okay?), but trust me - this is very bad design and not worth the hassle."
2,"Who's more powerful than King Kong? What creature is smarter than Mothra, more agile than Rodan, and more terrifying than King Ghidorah? Why, a giant shrimp, of course! Why not just throw in a mutated hush puppie and a monstrous bowl of alien cole-slaw? Heck, during the fight, the monsters can destroy a tartar/cocktail sauce factory. Coming off the high of Monster Zero, ToHo takes a giant step backward with an all-new creative team at the helm. Some view this as a refreshing change of pace. However, director Jun Fukada's spy film influences just don't belong in the Godzilla universe. Masuro Sato's score, while complementing the visuals, just can't compare to the Maestro's work. The actors perform well, especially ToHo regulars Akira Takarada and Kumi Mizuno, and are pretty well-developed. The inclusion of Mothra seems rather arbitrary and is not handled with much care. The less said about Ebirah(the Sea Monster), the better. A minor G-film."
2,"GODZILLA IS AFTER THE BAD GUYS INCLUDING A GIANT LOBSTER WITH ONE BIG CLAW AND AN ANNOYING SCREECH. HOWEVER HIS SCREECH PALES IN COMPARISON TO THE VOICE OF ONE OF THE DUBBED ACTORS WHICH CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS A BUNCH OF CATS CAUGHT IN A LAWNMOWER. MOTHRA SLEEPS THROUGH THE ENTIRE MOVIE UNTIL THE VERY END WHEN HE RESCUES THE NATIVES FROM THE ISLAND WHICH IS ABOUT TO EXPLODE. MOTHRA MUST HAVE BEEN IN A COMA SINCE THE NATIVES OF INFANT ISLAND DID NOTHING BUT SING AND DANCE UNTIL MOTHRA AWOKE.DURING THE ATTACK BY THE AIRFORCE OF THE RED BAMBOO (THE BAD GUYS), GODZILLA DANCED WHILE DESTROYING THE JET FIGHTERS. HE ALSO PLAYED BASEBALL WITH EBIRAH, THE LOBSTER ON STEROIDS.THE MOVIE WAS KIND OF SILLY BUT STILL ENJOYABLE. ALL IN ALL, THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER GODZILLA MOVIES WHICH ARE BETTER THAN THIS ONE."
2,This was a huge waste of money. They cut my fingernails at all. The clippers are too weak. You can just tell by picking the set up that it's cheap
2,The finger nail clipper is not capable of cutting through a finger nail. The blade edges are not properly aligned. There are very cheap plastic elements with an overall cheap feel. Do not buy this product with any expectation of satisfaction.
2,Too many things in one product and none of them work effectively. Please look out or something simpler and cheaper..
2,The style is OK. But it's too thin to keep away the sunshine. It's also too short for our window.
2,"I do not wish this book upon anyone. It is laden with an extreme, unexcusable amount of typographical errors. The Descartes essay, for instance, contains about four or five misprints on some pages! Especially in a subject such as philosophy, this leads to needless confusion- especially if one isattempting to focus and grasp the essence of the text. Shame on their editors."
2,I was also surprised that this guy put a picture himelf on almost every page. He obviously think he's very interesting.I certainly didn't.
2,"I did not like the novel in the beginning, but then later on the book gets more interesting. This book is an abortion fiction book It is about many medical rblems which als create political problem, so it is mixed. If you like books that talks about abortion and medical issues, this is the book is that the book can also like mstry books, well, you have found it. What I like about the book is that the book can relate to real life even though this novel is fiction. It is outstanding, but once again I won't say it was the best book I have ever read in my life. This is a book that has mystery throughout the whole story about many women who are dead or are dead or are bleeding to death. This book has lots of suspense.If you ask me about recommending it I would say not to read it bu then again there are many people who like certain types of books. If you like to follow through stories, this book can be a little challenging"
2,"This book is not well written, has too many uninteresting, stereotyped characters and, while very dense, is not worth the time it takes to make your way through all his words. I will not finish it and could not recommend it."
2,This piece appears better crafted in the image than it actually is. It is poor quality sterling at best. The details are rounded and not cleanly etched. For the price I expected much better in such a small piece. I do enjoy the design but wear it more often as a lapel pin than a pendant. Service was speedy but don't get this item if you want fine detail.
2,"the title ""condomblack "" suggest that you are gonna find candomble music here , or at least something afro-brazilian , mixed with pop or something .This CD is a dissapointament .Nothings happen here . A mediocre singer singing mediocre songs .I can't understand ."
2,"i thought this book was an ok start for someone who has not had the opportunity to reflect on how their feelings are a direct result of dealing with a parent of manic depression. however, i was dissappointed that the author did not get into more depth about how she specifically achieved her newfound ability to cope with her mother's illness, especially since she endured abuse. she goes from one extreme to the other-from abuse to a great understanding and acceptance of her mother. this does not seem very realistic to me. what happened in between? how did she get there? that's the meat that could be very helpful. i think that for most people, the illness gets worse with time and it becomes increasingly challenging to deal with the family member. it takes great inner stength and endurance to deal with it especially if you are the only person around to help out."
2,"Jonathan Wells goal is clear. He attempts to debunk evolution by pointing out textbook errors; however, one does not overturn science by pointing out publishing errors. The proper way to go about arguing against a well-established paradigm is in the scientific literature. Wells is strangely silent in the scientific venue and one can only assume that he hopes to overcome real science by appealing to the masses through the use of 'spin' rhetoric. Wells contribution will no doubt find favor among his ye-creationist brethren, but he offers little in the way of useful scientific argument. Apparently, he thinks that pointing out errors in High school and college textbooks is the same thing as basic research. This book is of little use in promoting ye-creationism or refuting his Quixotic nemesis."
2,"As a graduate of the University of Utah, whose professors shoved Evolution down our throats, it is refreshing to see that there are actually scientists that know that evolution is an extremely flawed theory. The book presents its material in an easy to read, logical, non-jargon-istic way.It is frightening to know that my children are using the very books that Dr. Wells cites."
2,"What might have been an intriguing work of skepticism is nothing more than an anti-science treatise filled with misconceptions and deliberately misleading quotes. What the book is not filled with is evidence to back any of the author's assertions. I am no scientist; simply a well-read ""layman."" When I read what is sold as a science book, I expect the author to know more than I, and expect the author to provide empirical evidence to support his or her claims. This book is not only bad science; it doesn't even make it as a worthy contribution to religious scholarship. It should be displayed next to the National Enquirer."
2,if evolution is possible in the lab how we exclude the possibility of its occurence in the cosmic lab of nature? the attractive style is a threat.i wonder that all revies were positive.we need more science literacy worldwide to save our future from attractive nonesense.
2,"my biggest beef with this book is the blatant lies and misuse use of facts.one example is the haeckels embryos and how the drawings are inaccurate.first off the drawings are 12o yrs old and i have yet to find those drawings in any high school or college textbook (with the exception of history of biology or evolution and only as an outdated example) so my question for all you so called intelligent design advocates that want the controversy taught, why would you intentionally mislead the readers ? if these are the so called icons of evolution why did he choose the stupidest and flimsiest example? quit living in a fairy tale and understand that science has to contain testable hypothesis not god did it ."
2,"Unless your familiar with Japanese funerals, or are very culture curious then you will not like this movie. The film is billed as a comedy but really only Japanese (or people who have experience with Japan) can really understand the sarcastic look at typical Japanese funeral. Although I can appreciate Juzo Itami's work, I had a hard time watching this movie to the end. If you really want to know what a Japanese funeral is like in a long, drawn out manner, then give it a try. Once was enough for me.The way this dvd was transferred is truly horrible. Fox/Lorber are well known for doing things as cheaply as possible. Burned in subtitles which sometimes get cut off by the screen, bad translation, English grammar mistakes and poor color control are Fox/Lorber's trademarks. Too bad they just dont care anything about quality."
2,"As mentioned by a few others, the writing on glass washes off and mine was just a quick rinse (not even through a dishwasher)"
2,The Show and Season itself is good but amazon sent me the crappy plastic case instead of the nice normal one. This really makes me mad and i think i'l just sell this one to a friend for my money back and get the better version.
2,"The measurement on this growth chart is not accurate, the company did not take into account the ribbon attaching the boards together, therefore making the measurements innacurate. This was a complete disappointment since I like the design on the board, it goes well in my toddlers room (sports theme). The company needs to make the measurements more accurate."
2,"I purchased this pad for my girlfriend and I so that we could play DDR without having to buy those flimsy cheapo pads. We were just begginers when we got this pad, and it was already displaying a huge amount of problems.Personaly I play on medium, and she plays on light. Withen not even a week of using this pad the left arrow sensor has literally shifted to the middle of the pad. There is NO WAY to fix this problem. I repeat, IT COULD NOT BE FIXED!So basically we paid $100 for a very expensive door mat. I have no idea why people have recommended this product, or why it has gotten so many great reviews. But you've been officially warned!(Also the same dilemma is now happening to the down arrow sensor, we are using the foam and we are folding the pad properly and taking good care of it. But for the safety of your wallet shop for something that is actually worth the money.)"
2,"These pads are warrantied for 60 days. Ours (we purchased 2)worked great for 3 months, then slowly both started having problems. I contacted the company to see if there is anyway to have them repaired. They told me to buy new ones. Now you know what to really expect from these ""wonderful"" pads."
2,"We've been using the Ignition 2.0 pads at work for several months now, and they were used by the boss's family before that. The 2.0 pads work very well. However, version 3.0 is horrible, and that is what you will get from GameStop if you order the 2.0 pads. Plus, if you really want the 3.0 pads, don't pay $100 for them when they are available for $80 at the manufacturer's site or other local retailers. They told me today when I called to return them that they no longer carry the 2.0 pads.I purchased four 3.0 pads and returned two of them because the raised arrows slipped to the middle of the pad and could not be adjusted. I realized then that if these two pads were terrible nearly out of the box, I better return the other two before my return period expires. Go with metal."
2,"First off, Aaron Neville has a beautiful voice, so he gets points for having such a unique voice.However, I found nearly all of this album ""Nature Boy"" to be way too slow. This is almost sleep-inducing music.I've heard a lot of these standards before and they are not usually done this slow. So I would be listening to a familiar song, waiting for it to pick up anytime now, but it never did.+'s Neville's voice, the selection of familiar songs, Roy Hargrove sounds great as a guest on trumpet/flugelhorn-'s The whole pace of the album. Just generally too s-l-o-w.Overall, I'll have to disagree with the majority and say this one's not worth the money."
2,"This was a rather tedious book with little captivating appeal. It gives the account of Lord Byron, ala Interview with the Vampire, and his travels throughout various European countries, 'finding himself'. I thought the writing was disjointed as it didn't seem to flow well. The biggest question I found myself constantly asking was ""Who cares?"". Although Lord Byron is now celebrity status, I never felt drawn or attached to any of the characters to really cared what happened to them.For those people who are fans of Lord Byron, I suspect you probably will like the book and find it entertaining. Maybe that was the whole point and I just missed it. However, for the rest of us, this was just a ho-hum kind of tale."
2,"The Message is clearly and by far a perversion of God's holy and true Word. It's almost as if Eugene Peterson sat down one night realizing that he personally thought God's Holy Word was boring so he decided to pervert it by ""spicing"" it up with his terrible paraphrases and ""translations"" which makes this ""bible"" the most off-based and far from the original translation. He uses excellent descriptor words (notice the sarcasm) such as hocus pocus and 3 uses of the word potatoes (2 relating to something that is not a big worry) (he must have been a previous farmer in Idaho). Do not buy this book if you have any sort of reverance for God's true Word at all. I'm not sure where he went with this one, but if you want a good translation to easily understand go with the NIV, or if you want the closest renderings to the actual greek and hebrew, go with my favorite--the NASB."
2,"""The Message"" is a deceptively titilating to the senses and is not faithful to what the Bible actually says. I pray that you would seek the real thing and not man's interpretation.ex. Psalm 1Who is Peterson to mess with the Word of God? Other translations have thousands of scholars and pastors painstakingly translating each passage verse by verse in order to get the original and intended meaning of God's Word. Now, one person comes up with their own ""translation"" and calls it a Bible?Philippians 1:99And this I pray, that your love may abound still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment,"
2,"This book was very well written- but it did not belong in the Bible section of the book store. Instead it should have been called: The Message- an INTERPRETATION. This was a rather gross interpretation of the teaching of the most famous man in history and the most famous book ever written. It was a very interesting read (if read as an interpretation) for someone who is very secure with what they believe but does not take the place of the original scripture for those seeking truth. I understand that my beliefs are quite different than many others but to take the book that many people base the way they live their lives is a very dangerous game to play. A book worth reading, not a book worth calling a bible."
2,"There is no table of contents for the entire book; only one for each BOOK of the bible. For example, if a person wants to jump directly to Deuteronomy, you won't find the word ""Deuteronomy to click on to go directly to it. Don't buy!!"
2,I received the Bible in a timely manner and was pleased about that. BUT WHEN I OPENED THE BIBLE UP IT SMELLED OF CIGARETTE SMOKE! IT'S ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING!
2,"The Message regarding John 3:16 reads ""This is how much God loved the world: He gave his Son, his one and only Son. And this is why: so that no one need be destroyed, but believing in him, anyone can have a whole and lasting life.A reviewer states that this is a fresh view that makes you think.I don't understand how ""...whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life (John 3:16 NKJV) turns into ""a whole and lasting life"". John is telling us that if we believe in Jesus we will have eternal life, not a whole and lasting (physical) life."
2,"'The Message' is a great compliment to standard translations, but the Kindle version is not user friendly. The table of contents or search function does not allow you to go to an individual book for the purpose of study. Other Kindle versions of the Bible (like the NASB) have this feature, so I'm not sure why 'The Message' is set up differently. I returned this version and purchased 'The Message 2.0' thinking it was an upgrade, but still no ability to select an individual book (like Philippians). You just have to guess at page numbers until you get close."
2,"I purchased this CD because of the positive reviews and Gorden Jenkins reputation. What I got was some sort of audio play put to music. This is far from anyones masterpiece. Unless thats what your looking for. Mr Jenkins has many musical accomplishments to enjoy. This must have been some sort of attempt to ""stretch"" his creativity. Stick with his other works."
2,It would not release the gun easy enough. Also the holster has no tension adjustment screw on it.I have a Fobus for my Ruger P101! works perfect and has a tension screw
2,"These things are all hype. They do nothing. The pads do not get lighter as you use them, they look the same after every night. From what I can tell, the dried vinegar in the pads absorbs your sweat, oxidizes (which makes it look that ugly brown), and stinks. That's all."
2,"I bought a ten pack. I am not too sensitive to smells, so the smell didn't bother me too much. What I had a problem with is following directions late at night to try and figure out how to put these on correctly.I did it wrong at least twice. I felt like I wasted my money.I didn't notice any results the times that I got it right, (and the adhesive still came off in the night)."
2,The quality on this DVD looks like one of those multi-generation VHS dubs you find bootlegged at a convention! This is probably the WORST quality DVD I've ever seen! The 8mm home movie footage actually sometimes looks BETTER than the interviews shot back in 1993! Simply HORRIBLE!!!
2,My friends and I agree that this CD has a dark side influenced by the combination of Tret and Cris. We miss the old song from Cris that seem to have more meaning for us. The music itself seem repetitive.
2,"While I loved this product I have since given it away to someone who didn't really care about the BPA, etc. that is in it. I guess it is a personal choice even given the information on the news today. I wrote to OXO and this is their reply regarding the materials in the meausing cup:The materials are as followsPC (cup)Santoprene (handle)The Angled Measuring Cups have BPA. However, the amount of Bisphenol A present in the Angled Measuring Cups is less than half of the allowable limit by the European standard.I know that tomatoes and other acidic materials cause these chemicals to leach even faster into your foods once they come into contact with BPA. Personally I would rather use glass. Maybe OXO can come up with a better/revised product."
2,"I have four of these in graduated sizes. They are easy to read and pour very well, and they nest for storage. However, eventually they have all cracked at the bottom, as another reviewer wrote. I even replaced one and thought by never using it for hot liquids that might help, and top rack washing in the dishwasher. No such luck, cracked again, and then they leak. And I am afraid to use them in the microwave because they are plastic. A great idea, but seriously flawed."
2,prefilters are required as are filters. Be sure they are OEM only. After market filters fit but do not filter the same as the orginals.
2,I was sorry I purchased this for my dad. It is off color and inappropriate in our book. I remembered it differently from childhood.
2,"Praise the lord, it's dead and gone. Put a stake thruough its heart and scatter the ashes and let no child ever have to sit thru two hours on a Saturday night of this infernally painfully awful show. Still gives me the shivers. ""Heh, maybe we'll have some new jokes next week."" Maybe not. Hell is actors telling jokes that are charitably called corn-ball in a fake cornfield week after week after week. I used to pray that someone got 'is goldurn foot caught in a thresher."
2,"No useful interior design advice, a lot of stories about how cleaning your house will make you happy. Save your money."
2,"The American Nation is not a well-written book, to say the least. It is long, boring, and at times confusing. When preparing to take the AP History test, I did not turn to the textbook my class had used, but a textbook my father used during his college days. That book was more helpful. If there is any spark of something flavorful and unique in American history, John Garraty has successfully sucked it out with his treatise on his ""exalted"" opinion. Reading this book was tedious, and at times more trouble than it was worth. Here the world has a book that goes in circles endlessly, instead of making a true point. The word choice is not lively, and it does not inspire those reading it. Instead, The American Nation leaves students feeling drained and disillusioned. I do not reccomend this book. It's miserable and convoluted."
2,"This product is not essential at all! It barely feels like its cleaning anything, and it doesnt reach all the way to the curved bottom! I easily forget to take it out and it renders me from playing. Over all it is a big nuissense!"
2,"I don't have much luck with pepper mills/grinders, it seems. I read the reviews for this and thought that it would be much handier than the wooden mills and liked the idea of the catch container below the grinding element. Used it off and on since I got it in late June and last night it jammed and broke when I was cranking out a teaspoon. Plastic has its limits, and now will order a metal mill."
2,Purchase this to use with my 2.5 in .38 Special but it was not comfortable probably because im not privvy to having such a had object on my hip. Im more accustomed to leather rigs that are attached to my tactical belt..to each their own.
2,"I purchased this video because of others recomendations however I regret having wasted my money. The quality is bad, the script is weak and the entire moving was boring."
2,"It is a close call - which stands more as a testament to the intellectual and moral bankruptcy of Western Civilization - EN, or the fact that they have fans? One can't say. Probably, the best answer is that either one is sufficient to reach the conclusion. Together, the band, the ""music"", and the fans, are a wholesale condemnation of all that matters.You want to sit around and stew in your vacuity? You want to convince yourself that you're nothing more than a bag of stinking pus? That faith, reason, and all human effort are illusory and for naught? This is the band for you. Enjoy."
2,"This product is terrible. After washing out my eyes several times, my eyes are still burning 12 hours later. It is not cheap either. What a waste!"
2,"This book is sort of the stereotypical ""How to hide your money offshore"" sort of book, which totally ignores the realities of how people, banks and trust companies must respond to subpoenas, and how they must report offshore activity to the IRS or else face perjury charges for filing false returns. Indeed, some of the strategies advocated by this book have since proven not to work, such as those involving offshore credit cards (the IRS simply issued subpoenas to the major credit card companies for their records and now the people who held such credit cards are facing criminal investigations and possibly significant jail time).In other words, it is unintentionally a guide as to what not to do. Pass on this one."
2,"While Anne Rice's other novels are extremely well written, I cannot say that this series is as articulate. At first I was really disappointed with them, but by the second book, I was asking my boyfriend to bend me over his knee and spank me too. These books opened up a new sexual fantasy realm for me, and I'll admit, I'm not sure I'll ever be satisfied normally again. By the end of the trilogy, I was pretty upset to know that I'll probably never get to experience the slave/master relationship, or such free sexuality like Beauty does in the novels. Changed me forever."
2,"someone had me borrow these..i had no idea what i was getting into and started reading the first one at work..the whole time reading these books, i felt molested..but i have a friend who borrowed them and absolutely LOVED them. she isn't much of a reader and she went through them pretty fast..so i got them for her for her birthday..they are..special..just know what you're getting yourself into when you read them. don't just trust a friends recommendation!!"
2,"People can say all they want about 'erotic fantasy"" and ""opens your mind"" etc. but in my opinion (and the opinion of the 7 people in my book club) this book was not worth the read. I am very open sexually and very little offends me, but this just seemed to be an exercise in shock-factor rather that any real story or character development. There is nothing sexy about grossly mistreating women and that is essentially what many of the ""sexual"" scenes are about."
2,"I was extremely disappointed with these books. No character development, scenes are poorly described and these fables lack the lushness in description that I came to expect from the author of ""Witching Hour"". There's plenty of erotica and humiliation here, but as readers we don't empathize with the main character because we don't know her. Had some exposition been provided, examples of Beauty's purity, chasteness and modesty, her downfall into degradation and defilement would have had a much greater impact. The sex scenes are likewise poorly and flatly described, and they are repeated without variation ad nauseum. We never get to hear what Beauty thinks about the humiliation aside from her constant (and ultimately infuriating) whimpering and weeping. There is no gradual transition from haughty noblewoman to debased sex slave. Beauty has been objectified in the worst sense. *YAWN*"
2,"Only Anne Rice could manage to write an ""erotic"" trilogy and completely turn off the reader with her lame dialogue, tasteless sex scenes and flat writing.These books are like ""The Story of O"" without the psychological impact. Rather, it's like reading the script of a bad porn movie.Nevermind that the books were originally published several years ago- the writing is just plain bad. As you're reading, you might find yourself fantasizing...about finding something more exciting to read, like a phonebook or your state's new tax laws.Save your money for something (anything!) more appealing!"
2,"This triolgy was billed as one that 50 Shades fans would enjoy. Nothing could be further from the truth. I enjoyed 50 Shades, not for the writing style or the edgy sexual content, but for the excellent character development and compelling love story. The Sleeping Beauty Triliogy is not even comparable.In 50 Shades, the sexual activity was consentual. Not so in Anne Rice's books where young princes and princesses are forced into sexual servitude and exposed on nearly every page to punishment, degradation and humiliation. Those forced to serve are made to crawl naked on all fours through the castle, eat food from plates on the floor like dogs and serve many masters.The books, in my opinion, are repulsive and a total waste of money. If you enjoyed 50 Shades, try a Sylvia Day book next - the Sleeping Beauty Trilogy likely won't be for you."
2,if it is like queen of the damned or servant of the bones it will be excellent. can not wait to get it!
2,"I bought these knowing that there would be explicit descriptions of sex, single and multiple partner, gay and straight. I am no prude. I had not read the vampire chronicles. However, I was horrified when the book started with Sleeping Beauty being RAPED awake. I flipped through the rest of the book and found scene after scene of this girl being abused and humiliated. Didn't even bother with the two remaining volumes. Even among S & M couples, there is usually some degree of caring. This stuff is just plain sick and very dangerous in its portrayal of violence towards women. Ms. Rice, get help!"
2,i read this book because i heard if you liked 50 shaded of grey you would like this trilogy...well i hated the books!!! they were so bad that i dident even finish the second book or read the third one. they were just sick and wrong on so meany leavels !!! i just cant belive anyone would like these books....they were just bad bad bad!!!!
2,"This book was too severe for me, I did not like it at all and returned prior to reading the Trilogy. I thought it was dark and can't see why anyone would want to read such degrading material of a woman."
2,"I first of all must say that this is my first time reading any books by Anne Rice. Now since tht is out of the way, time for my review. I did not enjoy reading these books. I read all three in hopes that they would get better. I found out quickly that they did not get better as I progressed. All of the chapters are very repeptative, someone being spanked,abused and or humiliated in some kind of way. There was no explaination as to why Beauty and all the other princes and princesses were made to be so called pleasure slaves. What the ""training"" was for and how it was suppose to make them better. I understand that this was suppose to be a retelling of the Sleeping Beauty story but the whole story was implausible. In short do not waste your time and or money."
2,"as a fan of erotic literature, esp by women, i found this lacking. i guess if it had been rated for s/m i would have been more prepared for what i purchased. this wasn't even enjoyable s/m...........too damn much ""spanking"" no character development, same scenes over and over again. i had hoped that anne's writing at this point was as excellent as it was with her first vampire books.....they became disappointing as she continued.i will not belabored the point with: hmmmm, what was anne's life as a child, etc. i will just close with it's not to my taste as erotic literature.c'est la vie"
2,"No story, just continual abusive sex. I Couldn't read anymore of it. I wouldn't recommend this book to any one."
2,I thought this book would be a great read with a nice dose of erotisism. It just turned out to be a story about a girl who gets spanked for 500 pages. The entire storyline revolved around one spanking to the next. It got boring really fast and I never finished it. I really regret buying it!
2,"Tried it for four months. Didn't work for me. The worst parts? They say it's the ONLY thing that will work and they blame you if it doesn't. The phone support is rude, petulant, bossy and abusive. They say they're trained counselors, but they're not. How do I know? I called at least 15 times and was usually treated like garbage. I'm glad it's worked for some people. If you have severe anxiety with depression, stay away!"
2,"There are some actors and actresses that were great when you saw them infrequently or when they did something unique. Zellweger was fantastic in Jerry Maguire for this reason- bringing a fresh female character to the Hollywood scene. Likewise the reason why she worked well in Bridget Jones is because she played a ditsy, self-obsessed blonde very, very well. In Cold Mountain she also went over the top, but again, at least it was unique.When I heard they were making a Beatrix Potter movie with a big budget I was thrilled. Emily Watson- excellent. Ewan MacGregor- excellent. But I don't understand why an American should be cast as Beatrix Potter- especially Zellweger who is known for these over-the-top performances that increasingly make you want to smack her. This is sadly a movie I avoided like the plague as soon as I saw the trailer."
2,"BUYER BEWARE!! This is the first Blu-ray disc which is supposed to play in regions A,B, and C, but it did not play on either one of my SONY Blu-ray players which have up to date firmwares. I believe the problem is that the standard and Hi-def content was encoded at 25 frames per second which is considered PAL, and will NOT play on U.S. Blu-ray players. I am returning my copy to AMAZON, and I hope they become aware of this incompatibility issue, and can replace these with compatible discs.This is a fabulous film which deserves to be watched in HIGH DEFINITION."
2,"Just out of curiousity who the clueless soul is that put this tracklisting together? Brian McNugget stole the piano portion of Me'Shell NdegeOcello's ""Outside Your Door"" and had a huge hit with it (renamed ""Anytime"") in 1998. Not only did he not give her credit for the track in the liner notes for the album, he flatly denied knowing of the Me'Shell song. It's comical because whoever put this tracklisting together put the songs back to back. Hopefully the liner notes for this CD show the years that the two songs were written. (Me'Shell's in 1993, Brian's thievery in 1998.) Sigh..."
2,"This is the kind of writing that is viewed as exciting and profound only by women who live in the suburbs and view the world through that isolated lens. That said, I haven't read the book, but the excerpt was not good. It seems a typical pulpy romance novel so I suppose if you like that kind of stuff..."
2,"this is the worst season of soul food by far. damon is haunted by his ex-girlfriend? bird gets the hots for her female colleague? lem hooks up with baron marks and learns that shade can go corporate as well as street?terrence howard is the only thing that saves these discs from closet purgatory. his portrayal of baller benny jones was enough to shake me out of a persistent doze-fest. this is also the worst TV show-to-DVD release by far. i agree with l. williams -- the editing will drive you crazy! why did paramount do this? how can they justify it? makes me wish i had taped the episodes when they aired... but even showtime displayed an evil sense of humor when they played repeats -- they mixed up the order, so if you were trying to create an at-home collection for yourself, it would have been all wrong. i'm crying foul."
2,I love this Bosch pocket driver besides the fact one of the supplied batteries quit taking a charge after the first use. Besides that it has been working with no issues for about 6 months now.
2,"You'd think they include a holster which is more useful than the soft box it comes with. I have a holster for my other tools, but this one is a bit small and falls out. The carrying case is a nice touch but not useful on the job."
2,"This item came back in the search results for an impact driver. However the item description does not call it an impact so it is not totally misleading. Its a good little driver, but I would not have paid this much for it if I hadnt thought it to be an impact driver."
2,"This mask smells strongly of sulphur. Even after washing my face a few times, my boyfriend still complained of the smell. I didn't get good results either. It did not clear up my face."
2,"Using the firewire input I ALWAYS get popping on any of the MIC inputs. The popping is variable and it may have something to do with the driver software, but I have been unable to isolate the cause. Ive swapped cables and went back to using my ONYX 8. while the NRV 10 is lauded as a great live mixer it is UNUSABLE with garage band OSX 10.6.8 if you are using the firewire input. Would change this review is I can resolve this issue"
2,"I paid $236 for this watch and it kept good time for about 2 weeks. After that the time was off by more than 4hrs, and the date was off also. The list price seems very inflated. I returned the watch and will not be buying another Stuhrling."
2,"This is a nice animated movie but nothing more. Tries to be a bit scary at times. A child of poor parents fantasizes about nice meals, clothes and such. As a result, she is drawn more and more into this fantasy world. She will escape and will return to her real parents."
2,I have no idea who this disc is designed for. It does not support 3D on modern 3D TV (polarized or shutter glasses). It supports only anaglyph 3D (red/blue). this item should not be sold as labeled.
2,Purchased this DVD for our grand children and unknowing to us it will not play in the US. What a disappointment.Apparently it came from the UK. Customers in the US should be warned of the problem.
2,"I did not enjoy this book. The translations were far too liberal for my tastes. Good concept, bad execution. Meh."
2,I been looking for something that would work my brain....this game is fun but like in the other reviews there are problems with the speech recognition...but overall the game is fun....and i really like the nintendo thingy....I'm looking now for a real game to play...and I'll do a daily brain tester to see if i CAN BE 19 AGAIN!!! haha!
2,"The stupid thing doesn't recognize your handwriting so when you write the correct answer under timed conditions it counts it as wrong. Likewise, it often can't understand your voice either. So you sit there for 10 minutes saying the same thing over and over again and it keeps asking you to repeat it. There is one ""test"" where you're asked to memorize 30 words in 2 minutes and then write them all back in 1 minute. Fine; great; no problem. Right? WRONG! It can't recognize your handwriting so you, under timed conditions, you can't even get one of the words. So at the end, the software tells you that you're basically stupid. Well, I'm returning it and the lame Nintendo DS too. DON'T BUY IT! It will only frustrate you."
2,"The most important question about this game is whether the exercises have anything to do with maintaining useful brain functioning. It's true that computation is important and that cognitive flexibility is vital, but is that all there is?Even if you grant that things like humor and imagination are beyond the reach of a video game, it's hard to avoid the suspicion that the test exercises are there simply because they're easy to administer on the little console.Beyond that, the game's unreliability both in terms of voice and writing recognition makes it frustrating. If you spend most of your time trying to overcome the game's reliability, you're probably not having much fun.There was something else I wanted to say, but I forgot. . . . ."
2,Brief and to the point. My 3's could not be read correctly 50 percent of the time. This undermines any chance of showing progress and exceeds my capacity for frustration.
2,"What else can I say? I didn't realize when I clicked on this prime offering that it was a silent film - wouldn't have stopped me if it was good, I do watch subtitled films from time to time. But this thing had me annoyed at the opening credits. They lingered on the screen so long I could have got pen and ink and done all that calligraphy meself. And on the calligraphy - JIMINY- could they have made it harder to read? Kudos if u can hang on through this mess."
2,"this book is about HARDY euphorbias (E), those that can be grown in a temperate garden. (Succulent enthusiasts be warned- not for you!) the 1st 2 or 3 chapters are of interest to any gardener but then to get into the meat of the book one needs some familiarity with botany & botanical terminology; What should be the most interesting part of the book- the A-Z of hardy E.in cultivation- is far too full of irritating detail useful only to the E. specialist & would not be usable (except by such enthusiasts) for the identification of an unknown species. There are 16 pages of beautiful photos of some 40 different species but,surprisingly, there is no reference to the text and when one does look up a particular plant there is noreference in the text to the photo. there are also some 20 line drawings shown in the list of contents but there is no indication of which page carries which drawing! only to be recommended to E. enthusiasts"
2,I absolutely agree with the reader from Shelbyville TN. I love Hannah but I don't know if I will continue with the series because I cannot STAND Kiki. It's a shame because this author can WRITE.
2,I have been trying to find as much info as I can about being a best man. This is NOT the book to use. Although it does have minimal redeeming value it has a real English slant. I would not recommend this book.
2,My little 60 pound Chessapeake had it torn the 4th time we let her play with it. Not very sturdy.
2,"Unfortunately, my 6 month old Weimaraner loves to chew on everything except this bone!!! I was hoping this would distract him from destroying my son's toys, our furniture, etc., but no such luck."
2,"I bought this bone for my two beagles. But they don't chew this bone often. If this bone has bacon flavor, I bet they will not only chew it everyday, they will finish the bone in several weeks. This bone has only bacon color. This is just an ordinary plastic bone."
2,"I've experienced the same problem as the person above. This piece of junk will periodically freeze with the display showing 16 degree F. When it freezes, you'll have busted soda, beer and wine all over the place. It's been repaired under warranty 3 times. Each time they replace the control panel and circuit board. It just froze again and it looks like I'll finally get my money back. You would think that a Canadian based company would produce a better product. We've had refrigeration for what....almost a 100 years. You'd think Danby could figure out how to do this. I've also had one of their wine coolers fail.DON""T BUY DANBY....it's NOTHING BUT JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Leick has managed to take a fascinating subject & turn it into a sleep aid. Her sentences are far too convoluted, and in a single paragraph she'll jump from topic to topic with no connections between any of them. Her use of punctuation is, to say the least, odd, and doesn't help any in trying to unravel her sentences. She also jumps about in her historical timeline, leaving the reader confused. She makes statements without any proofs and brought the booklet to an abrupt end which felt as though someone had chopped off a few paragraphs or even a chapter. Extremely annoying, too, was her repeated misspelling of one particular word. The only time she spelled it correctly had to have been the typo! And nowhere in the book does she give her credentials on this subject, making it seem that a complete novice in the field simply attempted to parrot what others had written. This is still a fascinating subject, but I think my next purchase will be written by a different author."
2,"These are the regular unshielded s-video cables you can get in the bargain bin of any electronics store. I bought it to connect my computer to my TV, but the EMI is too much - there are waves of noise moving horizontally across the screen. I have a decent brand name power supply (Thermaltake, $40, 420W) and I've tried using other s-video cables. I bought this to replace a non-gold plated s-video cable that was also suffering from EMI. To my surprise, this cable actually performs worse than my old one. I also connected a 3 foot non-gold plated s-video cable that I received with my video card (after I grudgingly moved my compter away from my workdesk). That doesn't suffer from any EMI, though that's probably because of its short length. EMI might be less for things like DVD players or cable boxes however, since they don't use so much power. I recommend higher quality, shielded cables for pc to tv/vcr/av receiver connections."
2,"This book was funny, yet somehow cruel. I feel bad for the people who know this person and have made their way into Ms. St. James' book. She steroetypes many kinds of people that we all know exist, but somehow it seems harsh in print. She also seems a bit full of herself. There were parts of the book that really made me laugh, but most of it I just thought, I hope she isn't describing anyone at her current gigs because she's probably going to lose some business. This part auto-biographical doesn't do it for me. She didn't tell me anything I didn't already know about how to win contests, etc."
2,"I found this take on Miss Marple to be shockingly bad--and I am normally an Angela Lansbury fan, but she is just plain awful! (especially compared to some of the really great actors who played the role) Skip this and check out the 4 Margaret Rutherford made..."
2,"While it is soothing because of its' texture, peanut oil, olive oil or any other oil would have had the same effect in my opinion. Sorry."
2,"I never used this product, it was useless. I would not buy this product again or recommend it. I ended buying some from schoolbox."
2,"On the packaging, these candles say ""Sparkler Trick Candles"" and they are neither. The don't sparkle at all, at best they may flicker once every 30 seconds or so, and only 1 out of the 6 candles on the cake actually turned back on after my kid blew them out. They are also very tall and very thin, so they break easily and some of them are curved a bit. They just made the cake look thrown together and cheap instead of making it dazzle."
2,I was really excited to get these candles but was left disappointed. They did NOT sparkle or stay lit.... would never buy again.
2,"A great deal of hard work and technical and artistic expertise have gone into making this ingeniously-designed film, but IMHO it was mostly to no avail. While the film contains some beautiful imagery and some beautiful music, its philosophizing is truly lame, and I found several of the speakers who appear in the film to be enormously pretentious, stupid, and irritating. This is MTV-style pseudo-philosophy of the shallowest kind."
2,"The software loaded OK and runs just fine on my Palm Tungsten T3.The problem is the manual. It is hard to navigate and is way too big to print. A good ""Getting Started"" guide would be great to have. It should include some example problems and graphs. Also, keep the methods of entry separate, that is to say, don't show algebraic inputs and RPN inputs on the same page for the same expamle problem. Divide it into separate sections.Ratings? Program 4 stars, Instruction Manual -3"
2,There is not enough time on each pose and the changing positions is too fast and I have been doing yoga for years!!! DO NOT BUY THIS...you will be dissappointed or like me have a sprain in your right shoulder!!
2,I just received a pack of these. Already tried to burn 5 discs. Capacity is supposed to be 4.7 GB. The Photodex show I tried to burn is 52 minutes (capacity supposedly 120 Minutes) All of them stopped after 47-48 minutes.Could not even get the full show on it. Very disappointed.
2,"The DVD won't play at all. (the other 2 is okay) For some reason our player cannot read this DVD. Is it possible if i can return it? Please advice.Also, follow up on the Microwave rice cooker that I ordered , until now I haven't received it. Please advice if you sent it too..tks."
2,"Be cautious if you buy this book. Despite the disclaimer that ""This book may have occasional imperfections . . . that were either part of the original artifact, or were introduced by the scanning process."", every page has numerous ""imperfections"". The print more often looks like hieroglyphics of some sort, and appear to be the result of poor scanning. You may need a clean copy of the original to determine what you're missing. NOT WORTH THE MONEY!History of Placer county, California"
2,I was forced to read this book in school and I hated it this guy had thought he was a dragon come on what does that say.
2,"When i first heard this CD i thought they had a very bad reproducing machinery,then i read the booklet that came with the CD and found out Bert Kampfert's daughter and his lead trumpeter started a band and where playing Bert's arrangments,but believe me they aren't in the same class as the originals.We all know how many bands go around playing someone elses music (Glenn Miller,etc) and they are just lousy copies of the originals,this is an example."
2,"This book is completely untrue, unreliable, and, above all, unbiblical.For one, Jesus Christ did begin to perform miracles until he was thirty years of age (when he began his ministry). Even then, he only healed to show others that he was the Christ. He did not spend his childhood healing little birdies with broken wings. That is an absurdity.And two, Jesus did not know Judas as a child. If he did, he was definitely not possessed by SATAN! Preposterous! Judas was possessed by Satan only for a brief time; when he partook of the Last Supper sacreligiously. John 13:27 of the New Testament states clearly, ""As soon as Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him.""This book is a load. To take this book of lies as truth would be stupid."
2,"All the scenes in this DVD are off security cameras. Therefore the picture quality is very poor, and they do not get close in. There are 4 G on G scenes but they are all from a distance, so you can't really enjot it too much. The Solo performances are horrible. Womean are average, not models."
2,This is even worse quality than they say it will be when it first begins. The movie first starts off telling you that these are real incidences that survalance cameras have caught. The film is very blury even for survalance video. The editors then digitally enlarge the action part of the video but it still deos not show enough quality to even reveal the identity of the persons involved.
2,"First off when I ordered this book it was listed as ""new"". When I received the book via mail it had writing in the book therefore the book should have been listed as ""used"". I expected this to be a book of poems and instead it's more of an explanation of what friendship poems are. This book is completely not what I expected and I was very upset!"
2,"These stands were pretty awful. I've had Walmart furniture that was a higher quality then these. I only constructed one of the two stands before deciding that I needed to send them back for a refund.When put together I ran into a slew of problems... The predrilled holes are not large enough to keep the wood from splitting when the screws are screwed in. So two of the holes caused a split in the front, exposing the white compressed wood just below the black paint. The screws don't screw flush into the wood on the top either, leaving them slightly exposed. The stand provides rubber feet for the bottom of your speakers, but the feet are so thin that the speakers end up sitting on the uneven screws that are slightly sticking out instead.All around the stand is incredibly low quality and unstable. I'd be afraid of kids or pets or anything knocking over my speakers anytime they walked near these stands."
2,"This book was not what I expected. I was expecting much more information regarding the topic of raising boys. I did like how it made an effort to show how boys think differently. This is a big plus, but its really the only thing I found informative in this book. I also think this book and the description on the back are very misleading in that it offers no indication of how much religion is discussed. This book is not for the non-religious. There are MUCH better books out there along the same topic without religion constantly discussed."
2,"What a disappointment! I felt I was being preached to by the Christian Coalition. Every time I picked up the book to read I anticipated being told that if I didn't follow the conservative Christian principles the author was promoting my son would rot in hell. And I'm Catholic! God forbid someone who is Jewish or Muslim or agnostic might read it.What are his credentials, anyway? He seems to be regurgitating what he read elsewhere and putting his own politics on it? I was happy to give up the book halfway through."
2,The listing says that it has a 1000 mA capacity. The box with the converter says 600 mA. It did not work for what I needed it to do and I had to return it.
2,"The law gives us 3 inches for a legal blade length, which ain't much. So why does Spyderco make the blade only 2 3/4 inches? Where's the logic in that? The other thing that troubles me about this knife is that it appears to be good only for slashing and practically useless for stabbing. Will someone write and tell me why I am wrong?"
2,"THIS PRODUCT IS CHEAP JUNK! THE INSTUCTIONS ARE PICTURES ONLY...POORLY DESIGNED WITH A SMALL HOLE FOR SPEAKER WIRE...YOU WILL HAVE TO DRILL IT BIGGER FOR WIRE 16 GAUGE OR LARGER.... HAD TO SAW THROUGH THE BACK TO CREAT A GROOVE FOR THE WIRE, SINCE NO SPEAKER I KNOW HAVE A CONNECTION ON THE BOTTOM...ONCE ALL THAT IS DONE THERE IS NO WAY TO SECURE THE SPEAKER TO THE STAND, IMAGINE YOUR $250 SPEAKER BEING BUMPED AND THE SPEAKER CRASHING TO THE HARD FLOOR. i EVEN THOUGHT GLUEING THE SPEAKERS TO THE STAND, BUT NO WAY....i TOSSED THIS CRAPPY PRODUCT...WENT to Ross discount store bought two 48"" pedestals that works perfectly for $19.99 I WASTED $36.00 AND 2 HOURS..... warning stay away!"
2,1-There was an obvious chip in the corner of the stand that was filled in with black permanent marker. You could still see pieces of the wood.2-The stands wood split as soon as a screw was put into it.Do not waste your time with this piece of junk. Just wasted part of my night and now I have to return it!
2,"I bought these because I thought they would be a good fit for my home theater speakers, which they are but putting these things together was a terrible experience. I split the wood on both trying to line up the parts and screw them together. I am pretty handy around the house and with tools but this was insane. There is no good way to see if the parts are lined up just right and if you are off by just a little, the wood is so cheap that the screw begins to split it open. The entire experience was frustrating. There is a reason these are so cheap; it is because they are so cheaply made. I cannot recommend these to anyone."
2,"Not a bad story as far as horror goes, but the real horror was that a book could be published with such an absurd amount of errors. Almost every other page had typos, repeated sections, or misplaced paragraphs. There were quotes from the wrong characters in the same paragraph as another character. How many times can the word finger be spelled fetger? After a while, all these errors became very distracting from the story. My red pen ran dry half way through the book!Was this review helpful?"
2,"I had always been interested in this book. It was ok but too weird, about a psychotic youngster. Get it if you like this sort of thing. You might find something to like about it. Definitely not for the squeamish."
2,"Good thing I got this book from a yardsale, free. The only reason I rate it 1 is because I can't rate it 0."
2,"Who is still buying GGW videos? I mean for $25 - you gotta be kidding! There are TONS of high quality adult vids out there. Women with toys, strappin' on and bustin loose with each other. Full on shots with decent lighting where you can actually *see* snizzy for more than 2 seconds at a time. All kinds of stuff: Costumes, plots, even ""girl next door/natural girl"" stuff. I just don't know why people are spending $25 for the equivalent of beatin' it to the Victoria's Secret Catalog. (Actually, the VS catalog is much higher quality).Unless you're in Saudi Arabia or Iran, and somehow this is the only access to skin you can possibly get ... ask yourself: ""Is this really as good as REAL pr0n, which *also* costs about $25?""Sheesh. Buy the real thing and be proud. Buy the BEST - not some crappy GGW vids. Your schwantz deserves better! Then go home and beat yer bojangle like it owes you money."
2,"The product says universal, but it wasn't long enough for my Moen faucet components. The product should specify the length when this is such a crucial part of the fit."
2,"I had confidence in Sanyo that these pricey batteries would be a good investment. However,after a few months one or two of them leaked in a Zenith motion detector/transmitter causing the unit to be permanently damaged.After several weeks of trying, I cannot get Sanyo to respond to e-mails or telephone calls. I was hoping they would replace the motion sensor that I believe their batteries ruined.Update: Finally got Sanyo to answer their phone. They wouldn't replace the motion detector. I sent three batteries back (two from the sensing unit and 1 that had never been used but had corrosion on the pos. terminal.) They sent me a free 4-pack."
2,"i received the batterys today but i was under the impression that they came with a charger. that is why i choose these.I could have gotten the same from Wal-mart,not happy with this deal"
2,I was excited to purchase these batteries b/c they are supposed to go a long time without recharging and they are just like my regular rechargeable batteries except 2 times the cost! Waste of money! Buy the Duracell rechargeable batteries instead!
2,I took a chance and tried these. They are not worth it. I'll never by this brand again.
2,"I got an 8 pack of AAs and charged them in the SANYO Eneloop Ni-MH Charger. It takes about 30 minutes before they get the ""fully charged"" light. It's supposed to take 3.5 hours! The multi meter shows approx. two-thirds full, but they die very quickly. Recharged again, same deal. I tried another charger with the same results. These are definitely going back. There are so many great ratings that I might try a replacement, but I'm am skeptical at this point."
2,Out of the box they needed to recharged and would not keep a charge for more than 20 pictures with my Kodak Z812 camera.
2,"After reading the instructions, I returned this charger without using it. The instructions state not to have any other equipment connected to any other USB ports while charging your batteries or your PC could be damaged or data lost. With my router and mouse disconnected, I can't use my PC. The instructions also say that if the computer goes standby, the charging is interrupted.If Sanyo had stated this in the description on Amazon's site, I wouldn't have bought it."
2,"I would give this a 0 star rating if possible. The batteries arrived totally dead, despite the claim they were charged. I charged them and then tried using them. They only held their charge for a few shots in my digital camera. I can get better life out of regular alkaline batteries. I will be returning this product to get my money back."
2,"nowhere in the description does it mention the mA rating of these batteries. i bought them thinking i was going to receive the most current sanyo offering. to my sad surprise i ened up with the older 800mA version.my research indicated that sanyo makes the very best AAA rechargeable battery today. just be sure to get the newer 1000mA version, not these."
2,"I was very dissapointed from this product, because it was written, that it is worldwide voltage, but whn it came I saw that it is usable only in US (120) and I wanted it for use in Europe, so I had to return it."
2,"I have bought this chart to measure my daughter's annual growth. The design of this product is cute however the three panels are very flimsy. The panels are held together with a fabric tape which add several inches to the overall length of this chart but the measuring system on the chart doesn't reflect this ( the distance between inch 36 and 37 is an inch and a half). Therefore, I had to measure my daughter and then manually enter it on the chart. Not much of a growing chart to me. The stickers included to record Birthdays and Special Occasions are small and melt together with the background color/design, therefore are really hard to spot.A complete waist of money!!!"
2,"I expected so much from this movie, having heard great critical reviews. It delivered nothing! First of all, it is billed as a ""comedy"" so I expected to laugh. There is nothing even remotely funny about any part of this film. Second, there is not a single likeable character in the whole film. I didn't care what happened to any of them. Third it is pretty predictable, no surprises anywhere. So if you want comedy, look elsewhere. If you want to watch a bunch of miserable people for two hours, this is the film for you."
2,It's ok: got to LOVE big corps that want to save on the very labor that built them.Save for a rainy day by the fire.
2,"Looking at George Clooney for 90 minutes only goes so far. This movie was terrible. I felt like I was watching Groundhog Day all over again. Clooney flies all over the country to fire people. The movie shows George in an airport, shows the name of the city on the screen, Georges fires someone, George is back flying again, city name on the screen, fires someone, etc., et.... It never goes anywhere of interest. The fact that he and the supporting female character were nominated for academy awards is beyond me. Neither put in a ""wow"" performance.Don't bother with this one."
2,"This book was a disappointment as a gift purchase. First I found the paper book cover and spiral plastic binding to give it a cheap inferior appearance. Secondly each page was illustrated with the same pencil drawing of a golfer.Before returning the book I gave it to my husband to look at the contents of the book, he wasn't impressed."
2,I totally regret buying this game. I bought it thinking it'd be more like Brainage and even got to play the demo of it but it was totally not what I expected when I got the real game. I'm totally disappointed bcuz there's not a lot of mind games and I'm sure everyone scores about the same and the way they score you makes you feel like your stupid. I should of just waited til' I found a store that carried Brainage instead. That game scores you by the age of your brain not by the weight of your brain. Totally not worth your money. If you really wanna play this rent it from BlockBuster or something cuz you'll get tired of it real quick !!! I know I did. (T~T)
2,This isnt an amazing game. You quickly feel like you have done evrything over and over... because you do. Get Brain Age its a lot better and more fun.
2,"I have now had this pan for about one year. At first I simply loved it but it must be used at very, very low heat or the coating just flakes right off."
2,"This CD has horrible production; it sounds like it was recorded in someone's basement (which it probably was).The first two tracks sound like some teenagers are playing music from ""The Addams Family"" while chanting in Latin to Satan. It is cheesy but somehow charming. The rest of the songs suddenly burst into dirty-1980's-punk-rock chord progressions which have a notably dark & oppressive feel; the bad production somehow adds to a creepy ambiance. These songs are interspersed with wild, fast tapping solos which seem a bit out of place against the comparably plain music; the songs are carrried along by slightly distorted growling vocals.Altogether, its unimpressive, but certainly worth collecting if you happen to be a rabid fanatic of the early efforts from satanic bands, or like the sound of a bunch of teenagers trying to be evil in their basement."
2,"Lawson attempts to answer metaphysical questions from a thinly disguised British empirical standpoint are disappointing and contradictory. This is not a threatening book as one reviewer here claims. It is, rather an uncomfortable remix of the old fashioned (think Russell at his most pontifical) and the already stated (think Wittgenstein and French post structuralism.) The result is an odd sort of pantomime horse - whose head doesn't match its hindquarters.More penetrating and erudite analyses from the British American school come from Charles Taylor (Sources of the Self), Alasdair McIntyre (After Virtue) and Thomas Nagel (The View from Nowhere)."
2,"when the item was plugged in for the first it failed to operate. i called Sherwood customer support on 9/21/10, 3 times. as of today 9/30/10 still no response, 9 days. finally i turned to amazon for support and they agreed to help fix the problem. and they did , i had to go with an exchange because of size problems, or i would not own this Sherwood product today. thank you amazon, and as far as Sherwood goes they may have made a sale, but they , lost a costumer over indifference ."
2,Rebecca Ray11/15/05Reading reportp.2SeedfolkI am reading Seedfolk it is a pretty good book. The first chapter is about a girl who gets a community to sponsor a big garden for everyone to plant one little plot of ground. The garden space was a vacant lot. The girl starts out using the lot to plant a lima bean and help it grow. Then an old laity saw her watering it and desisted to plant a plot of land with assort of things.THEN all the rest of the chapters are on other people how com together because of the garden and they meat one another in some of the chapters. The old lady and the young girl met in chapter two.
2,"After reading the entire book, I've concluded that one chapter doesn't belong--at least not for elementary school students: The Maricella chapter. In it, a 16-old-girl is considering abortion after realizing the baby she loathes is making her look fat. She hasn't been invited to any parties since she started to show. She wishes her baby would die. She talks about leaving its body in a dumpster.This has NOTHING to do with culteral diversity. Okay, so she is a member of two minority groups. And sure, in the end she decides that she--like the garden they've planted--is part of a never-ending cycle of life and that maybe she'll keep her baby after all.Why does a 10-year-old need to know about such a negative societal situation such as this? Please, parents, know what your child is reading. Middle school students would probably be fine with this. Anyone younger than 7th grade, no way."
2,very very stupid. im not moved or grown. no matter what they say its not a good book. its not very good its not entertaining its not moving. its old. and stupid. the stories are to distant. none of them connect.
2,"what a magical book that teaches us all about diversity! except it's written horribly, has no plot, and well sucks. I read this for school and was horribly bored. buy this for your enemies and force them to read it. Their heads will e4xplode from boredom."
2,"The seller did not package with care, had cool pack that melted (cool pack had no plastic , was cloth).This sogged up one of the donut boxes ,had to throw out.Also both boxes had broken donuts as well as both donut boxes plastic top had ripps as though someone deliberatly damaged the donuts.I would of returned my order but figured after reading the sellers profile with complaints of the same problem and the the seller giving the run around , and the people still waiting for their money back that I would just worn you , order at your own risk."
2,"I bought this shredder less than a year ago. When brand new the darn thing jammed about ten percent of the time. After several months it ran slower and jammed more often... now it won't shred a single piece of paper. After a thorough dissection, I learned that the tiny electric motor was not built to last very long."
2,"This item is functional, barely. It's OK for use with a lightweight camera and standard lens in horizontal position only. With a longer lens and/or vertical position this plastic unit feels underbuilt with a sagging problem in the vertical position. Spend a few bucks and get an all-metal Bogen product, you'll be happier."
2,"I'm not a writer, but it feels like I could have wrote this book. Scene transitions are not smooth at all. The story of Neptune Small is a great one though."
2,"This was a gift for my granddaughter's birthday. There were no directions on how to use various items included in kit, such as fingerprint powder, 2 black cardboard tubes, cards. Two pens, felt tipped , were dried out. Very disappointed!!!"
2,"I am giving these 1 star because I needed a front brake pad set, and these are for the rear brakes (which it did NOT SAY in the description). The quality of them seemed good, and they appeared to be well-made, but I cannot verify how well they worked because I did not install them on my car. Returning for a refund, and ended up just buying a brake pad set from Auto Zone."
2,"Don't waste your money. Poorly made and punctured first set of batteries. Had to take it apart to clean and carefully bend back the sharp metal that punctured the batteries that almost caused a fire. With new batteries it was working fine until I had to stop it, because the container I was filling with the old oil was filled. King piece of crapper never worked after that. It would run, but unable to filter or pump any additional oil. Wish I could get my money back, because this dangerous piece of machinery should not be allowed in the USA."
2,And that is why it rates one star .... Seven young Parisian ladies meet at their 'cafe klatsch' and decide to lay bare their first sexual experiences ...The premise is great but my goodness not only are their first sexual experiences boring but the way the author portaris them makes this book hard to read and even more boring ....If this is one of your first erotica books I can understand why you would probably never want to read another erotica book ... ever ......
2,Received this item with one of the four containers broken. Returned immediately and as directed requesting a replacement order - that was over a month ago - still waiting to see if these canisters meet the same fate as the Hostess set that I will never be able to get. Very unsatisfied with this transaction as well.
2,This product is just what I expected. The pads are larger compared to most brand training pads for puppies. Can also be used for toddlers as well to prevent bed wetting. Not cheap but they work.
2,"These pads are not absorbent. I have an older bichon; not a large dog. In the past, I have used the 4-paws Wee-wee pads, and they work very well. I purchased these ""Wee Wee and Housebreaking Training Pads,"" because I thought I would try to get them in bulk, and the description says they are ""highly absorbent."" Well, I certainly did get lots and lots of them, but it was no bargain, because I have to put down so many of them. These pads are barely better than putting papertowel on the floor for the dog to pee on. If I am not able to pick up the pad right after he pees, then it seeps to the edge of the pad, and onto the floor. I really don't understand the reviews that like the product, unless they haven't tried anything else. I recommend against using these pads, if you are trying to protect your floors from the effects of dog urine."
2,"This is the woest CD I have ever heard!! One of my students brought this CD to vocal class, and we totally destroyed it with criticizing remarks!! I dont want to be too specific, but this child cannot sing. Who brought her to the music industry? Save your money."
2,"This volume, which has been around unchanged for at least 25 years, has a little useful theory and some diagrams of factory guitar wiring, most of which have fallen into obscurity as people keep going back to Strat, Tele, Les Paul styles. It is not terribly well written and while the most popular classic circuits are there, you can get those everywhere, including online for free.If you want to learn to configure electric guitars to achieve goals you want, there are better choices, such as Adrian Legg's book, although it is more a list of things Legg has done rather than a thorough theory book. If you want to have easy access to useful documentation for service purposes, several volumes of wiring diagrams are available from Stewart-McDonald and other guitar vendors. Either way, this book isn't what you want. It should have been retired two decades ago."
2,"This Joe d'Amato film takes the Women in Prison genre one step deeper into the abyss of sleaze, bordering on pornography. The plot, or lack thereof, is typical: woman goes into jail undercover to unearth the guards corruption. To make the film last 80 minutes, Joe d'Amato fills the story with lesbianism, vile tortures, naked women in rat infested sewers, and plenty of gratuitous sex. I gave this movie 1 star because there is no option for a 0 star rating. Even hardcore fans of Euro sex queen Laura Gemser will find this one a total bore."
2,"This DVD makes climbing Kili look like a hike in the park, and those who think it is, should try summitting via Arrow Glacier. It does have beautiful scenic shots, though."
2,"The film was very inspiring, yet the interviews of the climbers sounded like they were reading from a script. They also tried to make the climb look harder that it was... a 12 year old girl climbed the mountain, and the narrator continued to say how difficult the journey was. The entire film builds up to an un-eventful climax. The best part was the first 5 mins. when they showed the shots of the african animals and zebras. Overall a flop."
2,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. In addition to a plot that was anything but intristing and creative it was slow and seemed to drag on forever. The charictors lacked anything that would make you believe they could actually be real people and the entire story, overall, was too depressing. I do NOT recomend this book to anyone."
2,I have read sixth-grade English Composition papers that were far superior to this.
2,i could only read an hour of this. the 1st 3 chapters are on the bible code. the rest is probably just as bad.
2,"well if you want the Shaft... buy this video... But if your smart and put the money to use for something you really want,then pass this movie by inspite of the other viewpoints. not saying mines tops all but even for a mockery film this one doesn't even cut it. those viewers must of had some nice trees to watch this... So don't get SHAFTED on this s@*% i mean shaft..."
2,"If you're into Overkill, just go ahead and pick this up, because DD and Bobby are still churning out decent speed metal and more importantly many of their older, greater songs are here. What I dislike about this DVD is the sterility of the directing/footage. It is almost like the audience and band were shot on different sets, there is little ""in your face"" interaction. Of course, my separate shooting theory is BS, because thats NOT how it was shot, but the camera work is quite focused or claustrophobic - one shot lingering on one band member (or on the audience), with very few wide shots or shots from ""within"" the audience (see Emperor DVD for great shots from ""within"" the audience). Another problem that may just be my player, but the sound editing seems a little off - the song just ahead or behind the visual (very annoying .. anyone else notice this?). However, it is Overkill and they play a spot-on set, as usual."
2,"Please understand that Victor Paul Wierwille is one of the great cult leaders of all time. I was in this cult for six years, I took his ""Power For Abundant Living"" or PFAL course and his next course -- but thanks be to God stopped at that point. This is an anti-Christian, anti-Trinitarian organization that calls itself the only organization with the ""true"" teachings of the Bible. All Christian cults say this to include The Mormons, the Jehovah's Witnesses and other Christian cults. When ANY organization says it contains the ""only"" true teachings direct from God, BEWARE. ...It will change your life alright -- but it would be for the WORSE. Do not let this slick con artist -- Wierwille -- (who is now deceased) fool you into thinking his way is the ""only"" way -- it is not. There are numerous other legitimate Christian organizations that can lead you to a better knowledge of the Bible. Do not let this man's writing fool you."
2,"i recently bought my first dvd player. my neighbors knew this, so they gave me this dvd for christmas, knowing my appreciation for john lennon. i'll never tell the neighbors, but this thing is horrible. i was shocked by how bad it was. the liner notes do not match the content. the longest section shows m.d.c. detailing the events of that night. who wants that? kate millet then tries to fill us in on lennon's death... wait a minute. i don't know WHAT she was talking about.this whole thing is hideous. this is bad. you do not want to own this. this is embarrassing. now....what do i tell the neighors?"
2,"Junk! Two of 6 speaker pairs were non-functional(taking hours of tedious rewiring to diagnose). Three of 6 plastic switches broken. 5 crappy indicator color bars get stuck half way. Doses NOT accept 14 guage speaker wire as advertised. There is no headphone jack. Even the crappy undersized stickers fell off. Overall build quality is terrible. I'm neither a snob, nor an audiophile: I just wanted a new speaker switcher. Consumers should know this is a very bad product. Called manufacturer who had the nerve to suggest I buy their ""better"" model at $400.00!!!"
2,"This book was a compilation of anecdotes from 40 years of working in the White House. Although I found some stories to be humorous, I enjoyed very little of the book. Although the cute stories humanize our nations presidents, knocking down their ""God like"" image, I believe that there was no reason behind writing this book besides the fact that she could.I found some stories interesting, and I even cracked a smile on a rare occasion, but for the most part, this was just a silly way for Ms. Thomas to get money for a whole lot of who cares. Maybe if I had grown up during the past 40 years she was referring to, I might appreciate it more, but for the younger reader, it offers very little in entertainment."
2,"I'm glad I didn't spend more than 25 cents on this book at a library book sale because I couldn't get past the first chapter. Almost everything in here I already knew, seemed to be a bunch of old stories that anyone who has read the newspaper already knows, just thrown together. A lot of the stories seemed to be from other sources, not even her own ""memories."" I was hoping to learn somethng new, you'd think she has a lot of stories to tell. Not worth your time (or the quarter I spent)."
2,"This would be a good, if somewhat light-hearted, book if written in a logical manner. There is not a straightforward approach to creating a table, setting all properties, making changes, etc. There are always other chapters to go to in order to finish what I am in the middle of doing right now! What should be step by step instructions is instead spread throughout the book in a haphazard fashion. Not for someone pressed for time."
2,"We bought this for my daughter after finding the ""as seen on TV"" model at Bed, Bath & Beyond useless. This is no better. It's too flimsy and my daughter doesn't use it."
2,Good light weight tent for backpacking. I like the two doors. But I was expecting a tent that was good for all seasons. My error. Good for summer but not advised for the winter months.
2,"the newer version of this is not the same at all. cheaper plastic, noiser, splatters water on lowest setting. not impressed"
2,"I bought this from Wal-Mart and have not written a review yet - but I was so appalled at the low quality of this product that I had to write this to WARN POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS! Buy a better fountain, it'll be worth the money! This fountain is awful!I've put together a lot of things before and am fairly handy. This took over 30 minutes to set up, and it was very frustrating because the instructions were vague at best. However, I wanted to make sure I did it correctly, so I took my time to set it up properly. After all, there are plenty of warnings when you open the package that it has had noise issues, so you have to take the time to set it up properly.I did everything correctly and when it ran (full of water), it was VERY NOISY. Even following the warning labels to have it full of water before running it, it didn't work.Everything cheaply made. Not a dimensional product - can only be shown from one side. It looks cheap!! I threw it out the same day."
2,"As a recent undergraduate with a BA in Literature AND an African-American female AND aspiring author, it is sad to see that the ""bestsellers"" in the black communities only seem to be those books, such as this one, which perpetuate the myths that blacks think of nothing but screwing and having a good time. Whatever happened to REAL literature? Here's a suggestion to all of you young ""urbanites"" who think that work of this caliber--of the men-do-this-women-are-like-that design is real literature: try Toni Morrison or Alice Walker or, heaven forbid--Carter G. Woodson, a man who can AT THE VERY LEAST explain why you appreciate such shallow drivel that is beneath your mode of thinking AND portrays you in a negative light. You don't HAVE to gravitate towards a stereotypical prosaic genere that portrays blacks as oversexed and underlearned. For shame..."
2,"So this is the highest rated for pizza stones? I bought because of the rave reviews and reasonable price. It seemed to work well at first - nich & heavy, seemed good quality and it held up for a few months of regular use - then came the peeling. Yes, there is a coating that peels off and leave little black chips in your food. Of course it is now too late to return. Do yourself a favor and buy something else."
2,"We loved our machine--for the first 2 months. Then it suddenly stopped playing songs, and in some cases failing to recognize discs. After sending it back for warranty replacement, the new machine lasted only 1 DAY! This time it wouldn't even recognize discs at all! If I bother to send it back I will have paid nearly as much in shipping as I did to buy the original machine."
2,The table came in about 100000000 different pieces to put together. Pain in the butt! Directions are good but such a hassle putting together. Much smaller in size then I thought it would be but has room for clothes and storage. Works for us just fine.
2,"Is it possible that I dozed off for a few moments, and then dreamed that one of my favorite bands came out with an album with a big pink bubblegum bubble on it and a sound equally as tacky and disturbing? Is it just a dream that I saw Marah on an NBC news special whining about how they hope people start buying CDs and stop burning mp3s so that they don't have to work at Starbucks, just after releasing one of the most radio-friendly, yet somehow sloppiest records of the year? Is it just a nightmare that these incredible musicians, these huge Springsteen fans, finally get the Boss himself to appear on a record with them, and then the record is mediocre, at very best? Well, at least Bruce's ""The Rising"" is good... damned wonderful, it is. Until Marah comes back, stick with the original, not with the currently sidetracked derivatives."
2,"I bought this machine new and sixty days later something happened to the microphone input (really loud feedback whenever you plug any microphones into the unit, I tried many different microphones but couldn't remedy this problem). This is where things got bad. I called the company and they said I would need the receipt to request repair work. I couldn't find it but I come across it 30 days later and now they refuse to repair the machine under warranty (I will have to pay $60, plus shipping both ways for service). Apparantly, the unit only has a paltry 90 day warranty. (With only a 90 warranty, even Singing Machine doesn't doesn't think much of the quality of their own units.) In any event, their service staff wasn't at all accomodating or helpful. BUYER BEWARE!!!! Find a better brand with a better warranty."
2,"I got this DVD from my wife at Christmas, I was so looking forward to it and when I watched it I kept waiting for great performances to fill my ears and eyes. Well I did get a few of them, thanks Vinnie. I popped the second dvd in hoping that it would have great bonus features, nope! The menu screen has sound bites of additional material that didn't make the cut and the stuff they put in the video is of bad quality due to age (the Army band song is cool though) I have an extensive drummer DVD collection and would say that the Steve Smith DVD is the best one going at this time. Kirk"
2,"I blinked and it was over. No really, it barely lasts five minutes. It's a segue. It leads you on with its elaborate packaging (lots of pictures that make you question your choice to watch it while eating) and has a disturbing opening which leads you on to the fact that there might be a story here... nope. It's not worth the $10 I paid.Those five minutes were good. Wait for it to show up on some sort of compilation- then buy it."
2,"I got this game at the suggestion of a woman who worked in a video-game store and had played it and liked it. To be fair she did say that I would only play it once due to the fact that you could only solve it once. I was fine with this and still am okay with one time playing games.However what I had a problem with is the conversations between the people are VERY long and boring. You are supposed to be paying attention for clues, not falling asleep. I had though the Hero's of Mana had a lot of dialogue in compared to my other games but in the end that was nothing in comparison to this game. I was ready to scream at the first and second conversations. After that I was beyond board.I absolutely hated the animation. There is nothing I can say good about the animation. I love good animation but this was the worst that I have ever seen.I have never finished the game due to to this and the long dialogue. One day I may pick it up again and try to get through it but I wouldn't hold my breath."
2,"Hated It. Was looking for hidden object game, which this was advertised as. I got to 8:40 anyway, but say or do the wrong thing or wrong answer to a person, END GAME. I am done. I am in pain 24/7 and find games that hold my concentration will keep that at a tolerable level for sometimes a very long time. The Forgotten Ruins is a perfect example. I can't wait for DS to come out with more. I ruined my computer filling it with downloads. Don't like most arcade games, but Mahjong and Jewelquest work for me. Any old games or similar ones especially by Spintop would be much appreciated advice from anyone from you or your reviewers. Sincerely, E. Zaharopoulos"
2,"I suppose I should have done my homework more thoroughly, but to those like myself, be warned that these are appropriate for holding a spice mix, some chopped onion or garlic, or other additives, but not prime food portions. They are roughly four inches across, max. I am returning mine which is made easy by Amazon,(Thank You Amazon) and re-ordering some larger prep bowls."
2,"I found the science rather unconvincing, but perhaps I was very skeptical given that the author is also a fundraiser for a U.S. organization that promotes sterilization of people who are, or have ever been, addicted to drugs, which would have prevented the birth of Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, Jaqueline Kennedy, Dave Eggers (Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius), Frank McCourt (Angela's Ashes), Bill Cosby, John Steinbeck (Grapes of Wrath), etc. Any ""science"" that comes to a conclusion these genetic defectives would have been better off never born due to their alcoholic parent smells like that fish I left in the trash last week."
2,This product does not help plantar faciitis. There is no cushioning and the sides of the cup easily roll under your heel.You might as well stuff your money into your shoe. Then at least you would still have your money. The only WONDER of this product is that it is being manufactured and offered as a solution for anything. Total JUNK.
2,I thoguht this little camera was going to be great for the price but i was wrong. This camera can shoot a picture straight as you see it in the little view window because when i uploaded the picture the object i captured was to the right of the pic when i snapped a photo looking straight at it dead center of the view. so for the price you pay it's nothing but junk
2,the passenger side lacks a keyhole so i never installed them because i dont have power locks and need the keyhole. would be great if my truck had power locks so i didnt need a pass side keyhole. blah!!
2,"Who in thier right mind tells you to stockpile gynasmite? very limited use info here, several points that make you think but i belive most would benefit more from a more common sense approach"
2,"After opening the sealed plastic package I noticed a strong smell, not a bad smell, but very different from the other 4x more expensive shea butters I have tried. It's smells a lot like cocoa butter and it's greasier too. I kind of found this suspicious and went online to read about how shea butter can smell/feel and look like. Then I learned about the Kpangan butter. The Kpangan butter smells like cocoa butter, is oily on the skin and is yellow. All of this matched the product I received at home as ""Shea Butter"". Real Shea Butter does not smell like cocoa, it's actually almost smell free. Also real shea butter does not feel greasy on the skin. Shea butter can have a yellowish tone but what I got is mustard yellow. Either the seller doesn't know what he/she sells or...Yet again, cheaper is NOT better. I am going back to the 4x more times expensive, certified and real Shea butter."
2,"I hate to say this, but the picture doesn't represent what was sent to me. REAL shea butter is an IVORY to BEIGE color, this is a MUSTARD YELLOW color. The butter being labeled as ""Shea Butter,"" is in fact Kpangnan butter, an African butter SIMILAR to the qualities inherent in SHEA BUTTER. It's a good butter, but Shea butter is better and I'm giving it a 1 because the seller either doesn't know or either does know and isn't being honest.Secondly, Shea butter has a MUCH stronger sent, isn't waxy feeling.I'm only keeping the butter because I don't feel like sending this back.I'll be ordering from someone else in the future and not on here as many 3rd party vendors are selling this African Butter as ""Shea Butter."""
2,"I didn't realize there was an ivory option, when I bought this. The color itself doesn't bother me, but I used it to make lotion and it stinks really bad. Some people describe a ""nutty"" scent, but it really smells very bad. And it's strong. It also has little bits of shell in it, which apparently the ivory doesn't. It still does the job as far as moisturizing and giving the lotion a decent texture (I don't notice the shell pieces once mixed with beeswax and coconut oil), but it still stinks."
2,This shea butter came double bagged in a heat sealed plastic baggie. It smelled very strange and had a weird appearance.
2,"This booklet, as with most SPSS booklets from this time, is virtually useless. On a 10 point scale it would be a ""1"". SPSS for Psychologists is about 1 bazillion times more useful."
2,"As a previous reviewer has already pointed out, tracks 1-7 are recorded from the vinyl of the first two EPs- badly. The rest are demos for Drill Your Own Hole. The sound quality is apalling and the songs are not even finished and have never been approved for release. If you want to find previously unreleased GBOA material, have a look on Ebay, there are lots of new live recordings on there. Don't buy this, the band have been ripped off here and so will you be if you buy it."
2,"Well I was using this for the first time yesterday extracting the plastic neck of a transmission filter from its rubber seat and it broke where the shaft meets the handle. Now it's loose there and I don't know whether it will break off. So, since I bought it back in July and can't return it, I'll try epoxy glue before using it again. It might be okay just for pulling spark plug boots; but, if you use it for anything else better not put sideways force on it."
2,"Pros:- It's dirt cheap.- Nice, bright color contrastCons:- The grain is not smooth at all. If you're looking for photos that look 30 years old, get this film. It looked like I had applied one of those horrible Instagram filters to my scans.- The film had a real blue shift to it. I had to work hard to correct the color, but I would not recommend this film unless you're shooting people or other very warm subjects. The colors are very vibrant, they're just very cold and blue.Overall: I got this film off of a discount rack, and maybe it had been sitting in heat at some point. It had an expiration date of mid-2013, so it had plenty of time left. I found it to give very polaroid-y results. If that's what you're looking for, you'll get it with this film. It was used in my Canon AE-1 P, which I usually keep stocked with BW film or Fuji color film."
2,I ordered a box of photo paper that was supposed to be un opened. when it came in the mail the box had been taped back together. I figured the box had just been opened but the bag hadn't been opened. However I just went to the dark room to print pictures and the paper was really dark and exposed to light.
2,"I have bought two Conair HandsFre phones, the SW8260 and the SW9260 models, both have a convenient price and functionality, but after around a year of use they begin to fail. Noise problems, interrupted calls, etc. take you to replace it for another phone."
2,"I guess Baryshnikov was trying to switch from the world of Ballet to the world of Hollywood movies with this effort. But then everyone realised that all he could play was surly, prima donna Russian ballet-dancers, so they had to put the rest of his career on ice. I would at least have liked to se him make an appearance as a ballet-kicking bad guy in one of the 80s Bond movies. Unless you take your ballet very seriously or have got a thing about bulges in tights, this movie will come over as a load of dated, Cold War ballet hoo."
2,"Box dosen't latch or lock while closed and shells have way to much wiggle room inside, so if your interested in a good ammo box keep looking because this one comes up short."
2,Yikes this brush is horrible! I have long thick hair and it feels like I'm destroying my hair when I use this brush. I have large paddle brushes from the Dollar Store they are much better.
2,"After one week of use in straight, fine hair, the bristles are bent as if I have owned this brush for years. some are even curved all the way around such that the ball on the end is pointed back into the rubber pad. I can't see this brush lasting very long under normal use, and ordered a different brush within a week of receiving this one."
2,"A valiant effort, but an attempt to steal the thunder of a Purpose Driven Life. Virtually unreadable..I could not finish it.The authors do not seem to truly grasp the authors they quote or the New Thought ideas that they are attempting to relay."
2,"This week-end, my significant other asked me to help her with her Photoshop homework. (The class uses this book as its text.) Although I'm not a Photoshop professional, I've been using the software since Photoshop version 3.Although the authors are certainly expert Photoshop users, and have a vast knowledge of the product, the information was not conveyed in a consistent nor coherent fashion. Key steps were omitted, important concepts were not clearly explained, and exercises were not presented in a useful order. (The tasks you perform in step 3, for example, conflict with what you are asked to do in setp 5.)The experience with this book reminded me of that old joke, How to Carve and Elephant (""Start with a block of wood and carve away anything that doesn't look like an Elephant."")Unless you are well-versed in Photoshop, I would not recommend this book."
2,"Frustrating to teach it codes, get a power failure and you have to re-teach it. Pilot lights are so dim you can't see them in daylight. Branded RCA but not really, built by someone else. This is a waste of time and money. We need a really good switch but this isn't it."
2,"Our classroom lab uses these headsets and I must say that they break easily. Within three weeks we had students returning these headsets left and right with broken microphones. The part covering the ears would snap easily and break in such a way that there is no way to repair this headset.While I understand teenagers break things easily, and that half of the headsets that were shorted out were of the student's fault (playing music through them at high volumes), it does not excuse the fragility of this product."
2,"This Actron CP7527 Inductive Timing Light is Such...I use it for 2 times and it stoped working,I rate this Product one Star.Actron CP7527 Inductive Timing Light"
2,I just couldn't identify with the theology of this book. It was not at all what I had expected.
2,"The subject says it all. These things leaked all over my stuff, died, and just couldn't hold a charge. It sucks because they were real expensive, too."
2,I ordered this item from this company and did not received all that was promised. It said that it had a charger and there was none and a case and they did not send any. I do not recommend this company or this item.
2,"This mouse worked well for about 2 weeks and then it kept losing the connection between the mouse and computer. Tried new batteries, etc. but nothing seemed to work. It's so frustrating that I no longer use it. This problem occurred on two different Dell laptops."
2,I bought one of these. It worked OK about three months and then just quit. I do not recommend for anyone else.
2,"I had a Logitech wireless notebok mouse, but the receiver broke and I needed a new mouse quickly. I bought this thing - what a mistake! The connection between the mouse and the usb receiver constantly ""breaks"". I have to remove the receiver from my laptop, turn off the mouse (button on bottom is VERY tiny), and then re-connect the receiver, turn on the mouse again, and push the re-set button on both the receiver and then the mouse. SOMETIMES that works. Other times, I have to completely re-boot my laptop.Also, I have gone through three sets of AAA batteries in three weeks.I have rarely written a review on Amazon, but wanted to warn others about this particular item. I am typing this on my laptop and just tried to use the mouse (yes, I still have it - haven't had time to get a new one and sometimes it's still better than my efforts at using the touch pad), and I have to re-connect it again.I wouldn't give this thing any stars, but you have to give at least one."
2,"The bike came in and looked really good. Once my step son took it for a ride he said the breaks didnt work nor did the speed changer & it was making sounds. I took it to the bike shop and ended up paying over 70 bucks cause they had to rebend a tire and said it was put to gether all wrong! The bike came allready put to gether pretty much I just had to put on the seat and the handlbars. The Bike Shop said that the breaks need to be switched, I would of had no clue! WHAT IF I DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY TO SPEND?????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"This is the first book I came across on the subject, and bought, but disappointment lead me to search further and then I found two good alternatives. This book has several problems. Some pages are simply filled with useless information, referenced addresses do not appear to have been researched and most are useless or do not exist at all. On top of all this, you feel bitter because you get very little for what you have paid and you end up by not trusting anything in the book. With Holtom's Working and living: Portugal and another one, Live and work in Spain and Portugal, by Pybus and White, you get better value for money."
2,The original boot and the top spring isolator are all one piece. I was not replacing the spring isolator and returned these parts because they did not seem to be compatible with the original spring isolator.
2,"First and foremost, I love Morrissey's songs. I bought this album thinking it may be Morrissey covering other artists' music, be it live or rare b-sides, or whatever. Well, that was a regretable mistake, as Morrissey doesn't sing a note on this cd. It's interesting to hear what music inspired Morrissey once or twice, but it isn't something I could get to like. I'll probably keep this just for Morrissey's written notes, but I'll never listen to this again."
2,"I thought this was, at last, a new Morrissey album, but actually it is just a compilation of songs by artists that inspired Morrissey. Needless to say, I am very disappointed!"
2,"Two months after purchasing the Macally Btkey keyboard, it stopped working. I've gone through a lot of batteries, so I figured it just needed another set. New batteries, existing batteries - nothing worked. While it did work there were occasional pairing issues and it's frustrating that the on/off switch is on the back - why not put it on the front?Although online manuals are offered by the company, this model is not included. The website says that battery life is up to two months, mine was a fraction of that.I'm sure there are better keyboards out there and it looks like I have to start shopping for one."
2,"Continuously loses the signal to the mac no matter how close it sits; ""Pairing"" light constantly going on. Batteries wear out in a week."
2,The problem with this keyboard is that you go to use it and it's not pairing up. Each and every time you have to wait for it to sync...gets old quick. You cannot just start typing. It has to pair up and it takes forever. Not good.
2,"I purchased the book to gain a deeper understanding of the drivers that lead to burn out to help me avoid finding my way into being burned out again.What I found was a book that said the same thing chapter after chapter with no new information to solve the problems. I felt like there was no coverage of identification of burnout (or only passing references) and there weren't any real suggestions, only exercises which served to identify the things which were important to you.I also found that the table of contents didn't match the page numbering and the index had no page numbers at all. Add to this the difficult in finding headings and it made the book a nightmare to navigate.The one redeaming quality is that the book allows someone who's not sure what their goals are a structured way to discover them."
2,Iâ€™ got this battery installed in a remote control. I press two keys on the remote every day and the battery last 10 days. I can say they are non functional after 20 key strokes.I expected something better
2,It arrived nearly out of juice. I should have guessed from the super-low price. I recommend against buying from this source.
2,"Remember all those great songs on Discovery? One More Time? Digital Love? Harder Better Faster Stronger? Something About Us? And remember all those boring, repetitive songs in between? (me neither). Daft Punk decided to do without good songs and focus on boring, repetive ones and we're left with a crap album! Hurray!"
2,"The other review was also writen by me. I wrote it before buying the product. Now that I have the pad, I learned it is really bad. It is just like a mouse pad but is long."
2,"Someone below me called this guy the king of New York? What are you thinking? There has not been a rapper from NYC this bad...forever. I really don't like him, and I think that his music is overrated."
2,"I have always been a fan of the Diplomats, and really liked Jim Jones due to his singles and such. I never got around to listeing to his first CD, so I can't compare these two, but this is just a massacre. Only 5 good songs on the whole CD. Good thing for him is that 4 so far have been singles.""Baby Girl"" ft. Max B""G's Up"" ft. Max B""Summer Wit Miami"" ft. Trey Songz""What You Drinkin' On"" ft. Jha Jha, Diddy & Paul Wall""Tupac Joint"" ft. Hussein Fatal & 40. CalI expected so much more than this because it's a Diplomat joint, which have all been hot. The first three singles I heard were really hot, but they did take some time to get used too. Maybe it's the same with the CD, but I have listened to it various times. I can only hope Juelz' new album is so weak."
2,"This book has so many errors that if you do not know java well you will not get anywhere with the code. The concept of the book is all right but the code examples have to be fixed and put together. If you want to learn JSP, DO NOT buy this book."
2,"Seems this map is a copy of a city map published in 1994 by another publisher... However, it's nothing special, and the usual free maps you get at the tourist information are far better than this one you have to pay for"
2,This is a nice little hub but lacks USB2.0 and also its would have been nice to have a power adapter.
2,"I received this package quickly. The item was well packaged and could not have been damaged. It was easy to assemble and is still working well. As a reminder, the wall color is key to this clock. A dark wall will make the hands seem to disappear, a lighter color wall is better."
2,"Not only was the description wrong, the color was wrong also. I received 2 bath towles instead of 1 bath sheet and 1 bath towel, 2 hand towles and 4 washcloths, The picture shows a sky blue towel set with thin dark blue stripes, there are not any thin dark blue stripes on the towle set that I received. This is the only reason that I bought this towel set. The towel set that I received was all sky blue. I will never buy anything from Homespell again........."
2,"Yeah, these are just what you expect: cheap, plastic trays for DVDs or CDs, and are suitable for that purpose.One thing, though. They are NOT 7.2 inches in height as specified. They're a full 8 inches tall. So, if you planned on stacking them (as I did) in a space just over 15 inches, they won't fit.This seems a simple enough thing for them to get right."
2,"I was taking this book seriously until I read this sentence in the first part of the book: ""If you want to be treated with kid gloves, go to an amusement park."" Are you kidding me? This was supposedly said by an ""Ascended Master"" or angel. The phrase ""kid gloves"" refers to a TYPE of glove, a glove made of young goat skin, i.e. a kid. It is very soft leather and was good for handling fragile items. I highly doubt that an ""Ascended Master"" would use the phrase ignorantly - they would know that the term has nothing to do with children! So, it blew the credibility for the book completely."
2,"It concerns me when we feel most lost, most in need as human beings, we reach out for someone else's ideas and beliefs and let them supercede our own deep beliefs, history, and teachings. These books help some people; however the people who benefit the most are the authors and sellers.I recommend looking into one's own self, listening to elders and children, visiting our history/roots, family, culture, traditions, developing or using our talents, skills, abilities, having compassion, deepening our relationship with mother earth, and spirituality to find that deep connection and meaning in life. Yes, life does have great meaning. It is not an illusion. I am learning thru many ways. This book discusses the value of forgiveness. I am thankful for that reminder but discourage the idea of one truth or way of ""seeing"" or ""experiencing"" life as superceeding others.In any event, if my post has offended others, I hope they will forgive me."
2,"The Disappearance of the Universe is so negative, so condescending, and so dictatorial, but at the same time blames traditional Christianity for being the same way! There is a thin sugar-coating of love over an awful, fatalistic, morbid view of life. Basically we're told that everything we think, and everything we experience in our world is not only meaningless, but it's all a grotesque symbol of guilt and separation. When we look at anything with our physical eyes, even the people around us, we're seeing our fear and hatred of God. And then we have Gary Renard saying ""Hey, it wasn't me! I'm just an innocent bystander. These spirits descended into my living room and gave me all this information."" So not only does he give his book more mystique by coming from ""ascended masters,"" but he doesn't have to take responsibility for any of the content, either. What a joke!"
2,"Gary Renard seems to rely heavily ""A Course In Miracle's "" popularity. The assertion that two ascended masters appeared to Renard along with the dialogue that he reports read like something out of a comic book. The author 's preoccupation with 'farts' and other bodily functions are juvenile in every respect. I hope that the Ascended Masters who reveal themselves are more mature and engender respect and deference unlike those in Renard's fiction. If not, heaven help us all."
2,"The most offensive part of this book is the condescending attitude of the ""ascended masters"" towards those who disagree with their philosophy. Apparently those of us who challenge Renard's ideas are either viscous slaves-to-the-ego who have nothing better to do than attack, or we're just ""not ready"" for this ""amazing"" book. It never occurs to the author's pompous characters that they don't hold the monopoly on truth. This is a book, for goodness sake, written by a person, and it describes but one possibility. There are other legitimate viewpoints, and everyone is entitled to speak up about them. Attempting to dismiss or belittle those who make other choices is quite judgmental and hypocritical. A Course in Miracles (the inspiration for this book) says, ""the truth requires no defense."" It seems that The Disappearance of the Universe has forgotten that one."
2,"I'm astounded that a book claiming to be about love could paint such a grizzly picture of reality, or tell us that God hasn't the slightest idea that we're here. It's pretty depressing to hear that everything we've done in life is absolutely meaningless, and that the physical world is an insane mistake. But what's truly incredible is the the judgment, hypocrisy, and one-upmanship of the people who are supposedly filled with the Holy Spirit's forgiveness. Try as I did, I just couldn't find the love in this book."
2,"Neo-Buddhist, Krishnas and all these other sort of ""eastern"" religion types don't really harken to the writings of the ""ascended"" masters, so to speak.This individual does what the neo-Pagan community has been wanting to do for years, throw everything out the window. He doesn't even try to talk about the classic masters, he just makes his own up.Isn't it lovely that these spiritual masters just appear to one nut-job and then bang, poof gone? Yeah... right.. more neo-Pagans trying to highjack reality."
2,"No stars if I could!It sucked so bad I don't even know where to begin....so I'm not even wasting my time trying to dissect or criticize this ""movie""."
2,I bought this bike from Amazon because it was on sale for $140 and had average reviews. I spent another $30 to assemble it. The bike is really heavy and hard to ride. The tires are too wide and the bike broke after riding it couple of times. I have had this bike for almost year now and occasionally ride it. Do not believe the other reviews. This is crap.
2,This bike is kind of hard to put together. Instructions are not the best. The ride quality is average. It is good for just getting around town. I would not go mountain biking with this bike. Good bike to buy on sale.
2,"For $30, I figured I'd buy it and donate it to Toys for Tots. I had no idea how difficult it would be to get this thing assembled and adjusted and, several hours later, wish I'd never bought it."
2,"These dishes say they are microwave safe, how if you don't use a pot holder you sure to burn you hand.Helene Jeffrey"
2,"As with all the recordings in the Detaching The World series, this is excellent music for bodywork. However, CD-Rs are very inexpensive to produce, so I wonder why this item is priced the same as the other volumes that are sold in the higher quality CD format. My guess is they're going for consistency of pricing AND the extra profit per unit. If that sort of thing doesn't bother you and you're collecting the set, then you should go ahead and buy it."
2,This series leaves a discouraging view of Wicca as a religion that violates and can not be integrated with established western (Roman Catholic) religion. An unfortunate mistake that violates the true core of Wicca as the celebration of one true God/Goddess. Not appropriate for young readers who have not learned the true premiss of Wicca and its respect of nature.
2,"Readable only as an intended, and very heavy-handed, parody of the cozy genre. Oh - don't expect any interesting tidbits about antique vases, quilting or tea blends more exotic than Earl Grey as currently found in other cozies. Rated 1 Star because this review program requires a rating."
2,"Bunn may make great coffee, but I never got to that stage. Received it one day two weeks ago, returned it the next. Swing cover to brew basket is flimsy and could easily break. Lid to pot was flimsy, and did not fit on the pot correctly; it was at an angle and would have had coffee rolling off the top. Finally, I did not like the idea of 200 degree water warming 24 hours a day. Believe that could be a hazzard I am not willing to chance, even when out of the house for a short time. To me, it's like leaving the stove on when not home.Amazon, however, took back the unit and promptly refunded my cost. Great to do business with them."
2,"We have been using a Bunn coffeepot for years. This one is a big disapointment. The carafe spout is too small so when you pour the water in, it spills all over. Also the carafe area is flat so the pot slides around. I would love to return it."
2,"The carafe top doesn't fit well. Water gets spilled all over the counter. The heater doesn't work well. We had another Bunn before this one, and this is not what we expected as a replacement."
2,"I am very disappointed in the item that I received. I have ordered from Amazon before and never had a problem. I ordered this NEW Bunn Coffee Maker to give as a gift and must have received a used one. Within a week of use the coffee maker showed signs of being totally limed up. Instead of a new coffee maker, I must have received a used one. I will be sending it back for a refund."
2,I had A Bunn coffee pot for 16 years before this one worked great no problems. I broke the little lid on the top so thought I would just get a new one no big deal! Got the new one Bunn NHBX-W Contemporary 10 cup home coffee brewer. With in 2 years the light went out for the plate warmer and it leaks all over the counter. Called company the won't send the parts to fix it our self you have to send it in and who knows what they will charge? Plus the shipping. I will not buy this model of coffee pot again. Oh yeah and my Mom bought the same one her light for the heat plate went out too.Bunn makes fast great coffee in 3 minutes. Finding the right model that will last might be a problem. In any case I will try a different model. As for the company they were not helpful.If the next one gives this kind of trouble I am done.
2,"Pure, unadulterated garbage. After viewing this bilge I was forced to realign my thoughts about women to reality. This film forces one to recommit to a reality that simply is not evident in any of my relationships with any woman I've ever known.... well, all but one. I didn't hate women before viewing this film, in point of fact, I've always cherished the time I get to spend with women in general, but all the women paraded through out this film are miserable & despicable, selfish & narcissistic, ugly & off-putting. Displaying no good qualities but demanding to be idolized just for being female. Maybe it reflects the director's view of, and/or history with women, if so, to him I offer my sincerest condolences."
2,"That movie was so bad, I can slap Jordan Ladd for writing it. I put it in the trash can."
2,"I cannot believe I bought this movie! I thought it would fit in wit the GodFather.........no way. This was one of the worst movies I have seen in my life. Seriously. I've seen a lot of bad ones, but this is Tops. I wanted to stop watching after suffering through the first 20 minutes, but I kept viewing to see if it would improve. It didn't. Do not waste the money to rent and especially buy this movie! GARBAGE!"
2,i thought this movie was gonna lik goodfellas or something better. But hell no this movie was boribg the only it was bout is bout hatin that's it.
2,"I just bought this item from Amazon assuming that it would be usable for both computer CDROM drives and audio CD players. Wrong! This product, according to the packaging, is ONLY for computer CD drives. It would have changed my mind about buying it had I known this."
2,It was going so well until she had to add her input on how the government should legislate a 2 woman minimum on corporate boards. I'm a true capitalist so to hear someone propose government intervention in todays business climate is quite a turnoff.
2,"Instead of talking about what you can do to help your husband make more money, why not let him help you make more money and he can stay home with the kids? Help him triple his income and then run off with a leggy-blonde leaving you jobless and responsible for those kids. That's a great idea!"
2,"The concept for this show is really outdated, based essentially on various ideas popularized in the 19th century. I did not find the 2 main characters to be beleivable, or likable. For me, this show is unwatchable."
2,"It works fine, doesn't slip which is nice. To look at, it's not much and looks a little on the cheap side, but again, it does work. I really debated over this one and the gray-ish one, and I wish I would have gone with the other one had it not been for the very long projected waiting time on its delivery. If you want one right now, and don't care if its cute or not, then this product will work. If you want something cute, go with the other brand."
2,NO ORIGINALITY ON THIS PRODUCTION...ITS A COPYCAT FROM OTHER VIDEO..I LOVE THE 2003 TO 2008 VIDEO..THIS IS A WASTE OF MONEY.
2,"There was a click in the crankshaft that was loud enough to be heard while riding and felt by the foot through the left pedal every 360 degrees of pedal rotation.I purhased a crank puller tool for $21.44 (incl tax), a crank wrench for $18.18 (incl. tax), and grease for $6.38 to repair this brand new bicycle.Upon disassembly I found two (2) metal shavings, each about 0.25 inches in size, that appeared to be from drilling. I have saved the two (2) metal shavings.I removed the metal shavings, cleaned and re-greased, and the clicking noise and vibration was fixed.Since this was a brand new bicycle, it would seem reasonable to reimburse me for the tools required to repair it. The total cost, not including and labor, is $46.00."
2,"The assembly of the bike is poor. After I got it, i practically had to reassembly it. There were many mistakes in the factory assembly. I took it out for a test drive and the gear shift broke. So assuming you want to buy this I recommend to add 75 dollars to it, because you will have to go to some bicycle store to get a general tune up. I strongly do not recommend this product."
2,"I had never heard of Geoffrey Keezer until I heard his jazzy rendition of a Christmas novelty song and it was great. Naturally, as a fan of jazz, especially jazz piano, I took a chance on Sublime. I was most disappointed. I can't speak to specifics about style, talent, interpretation,etc. I only know what I heard was vastly different from what I had heard and expected. It had no *feeling* is the only way I can express it. I suppose that comes from having to order music without the advantage of listening to it first so it might have been my misfortune to have chosen the worst of the lot. However , on the strength of that I have to cross Geoff Keezer off my list."
2,"When I used this product, I worried that the piece being superglued could come off, but when my monitor was stolen the thief attemted to rip the piece off the desk, the piece held on the desk and the plastic piece broke allowing the wire free. Now I am looking for one that is metal."
2,I purchased this in hope I could get some Crystal skills and develop some reports from my accounting system. Instead I got a home-made training manual that goes to a training course I will never attend and that is useless to me.The manual itself rambles on and on and does not even cover the information I found myself just using Crystal and looking in the help file.
2,"I threw these out after the second game. I am just now recovering from the rash these pants gave me starting about the 5th inning. I ran to the dugout and had bench-warmers surround me as I tried to adjust the wedgie from he@#. While wearing these in the second game, I had my first two error game ever. I was so tender back there that I was almost afraid to bend over for grounders. It is almost is if Mizuno had developed some secret crack magnet designed to destroy the wearer. They ought to put these on the Gitmo detainees... They'll talk!"
2,"This watch continually has problems. The watch apparently locks up if it encounters any static (back panel is part of the HR sensor). Sometimes it totally freezes, other times the buttons just lock but the watch keeps working. Not recommended at all Good idea, but lousy execution. I only paid $25 for mine and it was too much. If I find instructions on how to reset, I'll also post here."
2,"The great thing was finding an unusal item like this online without having to find it locally. It arrived on time, but the brass was pot marked in places. If I had time to exchange it, I would have returned it."
2,"The box is nice, but the sextant arrived broken - one of the screws had fallen out so I had to repair it before giving it away as a gift. The quality of it was not good at all, it looks cheap & there was glue visible in places. It didn't look antique or distressed, just cheap."
2,"Coffee not as hot as even I'd like. And I like to have it tempered enough to drink right away. Like others have said, you need to put it in the microwave to make it warm. I ignored these reviews thinking they were from people that needed it scalding hot. NOT SO!!! I believe flavor is limited in this maker too... And probably from the lack of heat in the water."
2,"If you have the Philip's Sonicare brand electric toothbrush, don't buy this unit, they do not fit in slots.I had to return mine, and am out shipping, handling, & return shipping charges. Just an FYI, if your electric brush head is any bigger than a standard size toothbrush, (diameter) don't buy it either, it won't fit. They do have a model ESA302 that works with the Sonicare, but it is alot larger."
2,"Wow! I did order and watch the PBS video on Marcus Garvey and thought that PBS did a good and honest job on him. I am an admirer to Mister Garvey. So then someone comments that PBS was bias and racist. Wow! ... Yeah, wow! All a person has to proclaim is racist to get the black vote. I'll not get into that.Of the sixty minutes of footage (mostly interviews with people that I have no idea who they are), I could only endure ten minutes. Then I fast forward, and to my dismay, can expect the same throughout.No. It was a terrible home spun video mostly of those boring interviews and videos of pictures found in books. Sorry that I cannot give a favorable review on this video, but I did buy it with hearty anticipation."
2,"Save the marriage type movie. They are going to councilling to save their mariage, when all Tommy has to do is make love to his wife and sleep in the same bed? This movie is for Fred Flinstone and Betty, or is it Wilma?"
2,"With stars like Meryl Streep, Tommy Lee Jones and Steve Carrell I thought this was a sure entertainment pleaser. How wrong I was. It was not funny. It was not engaging. I couldn't wait for it to end. It is in my trash can right now."
2,"This movie is advertised as a comedy, but it is a drama.You find yourself looking for the funny parts, but they just don't seam to come. It's about an emotionaly dysfunctional couple. Toward the end of the movie they are told you've made progress here is a therapist to continue with at home. They now are intimate with each other. It's a warning against letting your relationship go uncared for and how distant two people can become. It offers hope for the relationship. The only funny parts are in the trailers when you don't sees the seens leading up to them. Light hearted and funny this is not."
2,"This has been compared to ""As Good As It Gets"", but that movie had a good story line, humor, and it just felt good. I love Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones, but this movie was just depressing, the characters lacked depth, and I'm not a movie reviewer but my guess is just that the story was horribly written. I expected some humor because of Steve Carrell, but it just wasn't there."
2,"As charming as these actors are, and they are engaging, the script feels like it was written by a young person who thinks all relationships succeed or fail based on how much sex everyone is having. (Maybe that's true, but I'm sick of those story-lines). There's a fair amount of Hollywood drivel in this movie. I had assumed these actors would have enough clout to do a realistic movie about marriage at that age. Either they don't have that clout or, in real life, they are not nearly as deep as we like to think them. My guess is this movie died by a thousand cuts of compromise and integrity."
2,I thought it was a depressing view of marriage! Acting was good but the story not so good. No wonder so many marriages end in divorce if this is what life ends up being like!
2,I have been married a decade more than this couple and I could hardly take watching these two people. I guess the two great actors did good creating this couple BUT it was less interesting than watching paint dry.
2,"Not for the younger crowd, it was a very depressing and down movie and would only recommend it to people who like to see two old people fight over nothing and then fall in love again... Great actors, just not a great script, in my opinion of course."
2,"The trailers looked like this would be a wonderful comedy. It wasn't.It was actually a more serious adult drama and lacks any humorous content.If you are thinking this movie is similar to Streep's ""It's Complicated""......you will be VERY disappointed"
2,This was a terrible movie. I would have expected more from Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones. Great actors - they do pull off the roles well enough - but really? Come on - someone actually made a movie on this??? ugh. Would not waste my money.
2,Hope Springs had good actors but it could have been so much better I would have thought. Some scenes should have been dropped.
2,"Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones; has to be a winner, right? Wrong. This movie was not entertaining, funny, touching, sweet, or hopeful. Rather than eliciting sympathy, empathy, or general feelings of tenderness towards Streep's character, Kay, and her plight, Kay's one dimensional meekness elicited nothing but irritation. And what was the deal with Arnold? Did I miss something or did he never reveal why he became a stodgy, complaining, dissatisfied grouch? Steve Carell's performance as the warm and caring Dr. Feld was the one saving grace of the movie. Even that isn't reason enough to watch it. Sadly, I can not recommend this dud."
2,"Acting is good, but the movie is very slow and painful to watch. It's quite depressing. It's just like experiencing the problems and emotional pain of real life relationships that one often experiences when they are unhappy and stressful. With the state of the economy and overall stress of our troubling times, I would rather escape the sadness of the real world and be uplifted, entertained and inspired when I watch movies. I did not feel any of these by watching this movie, even with a ""happy"" ending that actually did not make sense to me given just how unhappy this couple was. It was difficult to believe that they could overcome their serious issues. For the most part is was well acted, but in the end, I didn't ""buy it."""
2,Movie not what we were expecting. Very slow and uninteresting. Movie download stalled toward the end and we didn't care because it was just plain boring.
2,"Movie gets to the same spot and will not go forward. Period.Amazon promptly sent a replacement and just had a chance to view and it does the same thing. We finally found that playing the movie with the "" remarks"" soundtrack that it would play. I am sure it is a production problem."
2,I love the three main stars in this show but all that talent just wasn't enough to save this movie. Too bad.
2,"the previews to this movie was good. so i watched it, and i thought it was a really, really, AWFUL movie. mr. jones and ms. streep are great actors but this was their worst movie. i felt like i was a fly on the wall(spying on my parents (love) life. i kepted thinking somebody please comes by with a fly swatter and smack me with it or brings bug spray and spray my eyes out. if older couples are having marriage trouble this movie would(might) help them. if you are the type who knows that your parents kiss, make out, etc. but get grossed when they do it in front of you, your friends, or in public, don't rent this movie or buy it."
2,"In tracking this AM, I notice my order being sent to Charlotte, NC. Why? Are you going to send me another shipment?"
2,This movie is sad. It is geared toward the nursing home crowd. It was painful to watch. I don't recommend it unless you are having trouble sleeping.
2,"I am so glad I did not pay for this movie. It was sad, and painful, and uncomfortable, and... not good. My husband and I were very disappointed."
2,"Box was totally inadequate. Split on two corners, badly banged up all around. Fortunately each battery was wrapped in bubble wrap so they are not on their way back (yet). (June 2012)"
2,"This product does not work. The lights flash but no dog or cat has even flinched. Standing right next to a friendly dog and pointing straight at the dog there was absolutely no reaction. Not a flinch, not a twich of an ear and definitely not scared away. If it didn't work on this timid little guy what chance does it have on an aggressive dog?"
2,"I recently purchaed the framer version of these gloves. They are cofortable, but do not last. I have been using them for two weeks and 4 of the fingers are busted through the seams. I paid 29 bucks so I expected more. I think I will go back to the Atlas knit gloves with rubber coating and cut the two finger off each glove I need to roll nails. The atlas' aren't great, but for 3.00 bucks they are far better that the Ironclad.Ron"
2,"I love City Hunter. But the people selling City Hunter 3 and '91 must have learned selling techniques from drug dealers. I was able to buy the first two seasons of City Hunter, which are like - 52 episodes each, mind you - for between 20 and 30 bucks. Now they want over two hundred dollars for a season that's not even half the usual amount of episodes? And I mean I love that show, but that's ridiculous."
2,This was a wedding gift for our daughter but after several tries to send it (they always broke) she took a credit and ordered something else. The pattern has been discontinued by Mikasa.
2,"Its a great message, and decent (not great) text but I cannot get past the funky looking illustrations. The cover of the book is by FAR the best one, but the others are so unnatural looking it is almost distracting!!!"
2,"I only got about halfway through this novel, whilst the plot was fairly interesting I found the characters themselves rather 2 dimensional.It was the unconvincing portrayal of the characters that led to me just not careing enough about them to finish the book. the final straw came when the when the computer wizard (who, by the way, is obsessed with making love with a facimile of his dead sister of all things!) begins to program genetic mutations like retractable claws and venomous fangs in people. Such comic book science soundly terminated the suspension of this readers disbelief. Had the author invested more into creating more belivable (and Interesting) characters I would have finished what had started out as a promising read."
2,"Big deal.I,ve had better luck with weightlifters gloves.2 weeks time and they started to unravel. The terry cloth for wiping sweat is a good idea though. Hardly worth the 20 bucks Ipaid for them."
2,"I was very disappointed in this book. Though I was interested in the biking information, I am mainly a hiker, and the information on trails was woefully lacking. Sure, the map in the back was great, but I can buy a trail map when I actually get there. My time in Acadia is going to be very short, and I need something to help me chose which hikes I want to take BEFORE I arrive. This book was not it. Gave it two stars instead of one because of the map and biking information, though in all honestly, I haven't looked at any other books on biking to compare it with. I have looked at another hiking book -- Hiking Acadia National Park by Dolores Kong, a MUCH better book, in my opinion."
2,my toddler loves this toy but the paint chips. they really should have kept the mouth area free of paint.
2,"For those of you who loved the original ""30 Days of Night"" like I did.....stay very far away from this movie,this really sucked and NOT in the good vampire way. 2nd rate wanna be version,waste of money,very dissapointed."
2,"I was hoping for a book that would present some new slant on Aristotle's thought. I didn't get it. This is just another attempt by Heidegger to set out his own philosophy, with all of the tortured grammatical constructions and neologisms that one might expect. I think that Heidegger is most interesting when he's actually engaging other philosophers, and less so when setting out his own bizarre and flakey ideas. So if you're expecting to get some new insight into Aristotle, look elsewhere."
2,"This movie sucked, it was very boring and that's sad because I like linda hamilton and gena davis. the movie wasn't worth it."
2,"I ordered it June 4th, it came Oct 1st, after they asked me 3 times ""do you still want it"". It was delivered from Amazon.co - LLC. I don't know how is the battery itself because I don't need it anymore."
2,"Had no affect on the green water in my pond. Perhaps my pond was too far gone when I began to use it, but it does claim to clear all water and had absolutely no affect on the water clarity."
2,"I have put up with phone for a year and I am now looking to replace it. The sound quality of playedback messages is terrible. The message recording time cuts off most messages. You cannot turn down the volume on messages that are playing back, so my neighbor 3 doors down can hear them. There is no way to retrieve messages when you call in. To delete the message is very frustrating and time consuming."
2,"I received this CD in 2003 from a friend who had just bought it from a street vendor in Washington, D.C. He called it ""ridiculous."" I gave it a listen and I had to agree.I like to think that I am very open-minded when it comes to music. I enjoy music from many different genres. But to tell the truth, this album is just awful. It's not really even music. It's as if the artist threw some beats together and recorded himself talking over them.The only clues as to the album's purpose is in the bizarre CD insert. I think there a message of peace, love, and acceptance that connects the songs on the disc, but it is rendered meaningless by the awkward sounds and vocals.As of May 2009, it is being sold for a single penny. However this disc is not worth the 0.01$ + shipping you will pay for it. My advice to you would be to donate the money to an actual charity that stands for peace, love, and acceptance and not waste it on this nonsense."
2,"This book is entertaining and filled with a lot of useful recipes if you don't particularly care about what the final product tastes like--that is, if you aren't interested in trying to make a reasonably serious wine. If making something possibly drinkable out of a variety of fruits and vegetables interests you, this will be useful. If you want to make what most people think of as ""wine"" (i.e., fermented grape juice) the book is not of much interest."
2,"I was sooo happy when my 12 month old son's Elvis costume came in the mail. However, when i took it out of the package it was filty!!! The front was covered in dirt and there is a huge pink stain on the butt. After paying almost 40 dollars for an infant costume I was extremely disappointed with my purchase."
2,"I was looking forward to reading this book as I wanted to expand my knowledge of Andrew Johnson and the period immediately after Lincoln's death. Unfortunately this book is neither successful popular nor serious history. It is not particularly well-written and the author lacks the authority or gravitas to make his judgments seem trustworthy. If time is our most valuable commodity, then save yourself a little and read something else on this period."
2,"I have owned this vacuum for a few years and have grown to like the theory but hate the execution. The lift off aspect is very convenient for tight places, cars, etc. The suction is quite powerful. Those are the good aspects.The bad part is the filter design. Simply put, to keep this vacuum operating properly the dust cup must be constantly emptied. Don't be fooled by the full line on the dust cup. By the time it becomes that full all the filters will be clogged beyond recognition with dirt. To make matters worse, cleaning these filters is time consuming at best. The unit also likes to blow dust out of the back and from other areas, regardless of how full the dust cup is and how dirty or clean the filters are. This unit has a poorly designed filter that only works (and even then not all that well) when the dust cup is empty and all the filters are clean.Don't make the mistake of buying this unit. There are much better vacuums on the market."
2,"Chips! I bought this set as a gift for my husband last Christmas. He used them about once a month. We hand washed and treated with great care, yet both glasses developed chips on the rim after 11 months of very light use. They are beautiful glasses, and we were planning on getting more this Christmas but since they seemed to need greater care than we could provide, and too expensive to last such a short time, we are now using and expanding our set of the excellent and well priced Glen Cairn whiskey glasses."
2,"""Dream On"" has so much potential for a decent remix. The vocals, the guitar, the bass. Instead what we get are some really boring drum beats with cliche processed loops of the song. Sounds like something I would hear in a club with mediocre DJ. Too bad, since so much could be done with this song."
2,"I have had the Tunecast 3 for about a while now and am really disappointed with the unit. At home, I have to put the transmitter on the radio to get any kind of sound quality. In the car about the same, I tried a bunch of different places close by and further away and never got anything better than poor sound quality. I tried different frequencies with no improvement. Really not worth buying, I am going to try to return it."
2,"I was disappointed with this sequel. It covers Billy's quest to find his mother. The plot was very contrived and just didn't ring true to me for some reason.Billy ends up in Santa Fe to look for the mother who abandoned him. He meets Consuelo, a singer and they fall in love. Billy locates his mother, but the woman he has created in his mind, can she meet his expectations?? I thought the love story was a bit simple, as was the ending.Kowalski would have had to do a smash up job with a sequel to top ""Eddie's Bastard"". He did not succeed, but I will likely read more of his work in the future, since sequels are usually a letdown in most cases. I didn't hate the book, or the plot, but it left me empty, therefore I give this book 2/5 stars."
2,"Mimi Fox is an excellent guitarist, but like many newer jazz artists, lacks a unique sound and good artistic feel and emotion. Part of the problem is that this CD is all over the place stylistically, which really bothers me a lot. It's impossible to get any sort of groove going. The second reviewer also correctly pointed out that Mimi tends to repeat many licks over and over."
2,"A big disappointment: lots of academic fluff, atrocious prose, and little substance. Most everything in here is not new, overly complicated, lacking examples or interesting insights. It's more of a compendium than anything, but who is it written for? It's too simple and basic for scholars, too elevated for beginners, and certainly both too basic and too badly written for writers. I'm sorry to have to give such a bad review to what obviously took someone a lot of effort to compile, but I find nothing useful in this book except if someone wanted to have a quick reference."
2,"This ""LED"" set does not come with LED lights!! only the two small ones are LED lights, the other ones are just old fashioned bulbs. I had to return this set due to this matter. As far as the other information it still would make a great gift for someone in need of lights, handles feel very strong and they are not heavy to carry around."
2,Was hooked from the start but where was the ending????!!!The book feels as if the writer didn't know how to complete it.
3,"Bible-Schmible! This is THE book to own!As a 64 year old retired plumber, I'm not one to often admit my feelings. But in this case, I will make an exception- The Jumbo Duct Tape Book made me cry. Tears of relief, tears of joy, tears of longing.I've fixed quite a few things in my time, and I've probably used more than my fair share of duct tape. (...)Among the many useful tricks you will learn in your new Bible are:-Duct Tape Clothing: High fashion on a $2.45 budget-Duct Tape Jewelery: Functions just as well as the real stuff, and screams ""I'm practical and down-to-earth""-Duct Tape AIBO Robotic Dog: Just cover a normal dog in duct tape, and voila! The kids will never know the difference!And, of course, the awe-inspiring ""Duct-Tape Mansion"".Buy this book! Buy this book! Buy this book!You will not be disappointed, and if you are, Jim Berg will hit you on the head with a duct tape club until you change your mind!"
3,"Set was packed well, shipped rapidly and received it today. Am very pleased with the set of tools (small for working on small items). Thank you to Johnson Level & Tool for taking good care of my order."
3,"Length:: 1:24 MinsThis is a solid, versatile budget driver set. Check out my video review to see with your own eyes!"
3,"I've been wearing loose glasses for quite a bit and I was too lazy to go to a glass shop to get it fixed. This set has all sizes you need to work on small items, fix glasses, pocket knives etc. You get all you need for around 10 dollars."
3,I had seen this movie several before on VHS and was a fan of it. The movie features everyone that was on the TV Serial. Jonathan Frid (Barnabas) is as creepy and menacing as ever. This is a pretty decent movie for fans of Dark Shadows!
3,"All the songs ROCK, and they all have a different blend that makes the CD turn out to be like the best tasting smoothie ever made! I love No Doubt, Gwen rocks, and I want to be just like her when I grow up! ""I'm just girl"" has the most amazing beat, and just makes me wanna jump up and down! Also the song about sisters is amazing! It reminds me of my sisters and I, we are all close in age (17,18, and 19) and we are all best friends! I would give this CD 20 stars if I could!"
3,"This is the best album No Doubt ever made. I especially like the tracks ""Excuse me Mr."". ""Just a girl"", ""Spiderwebs"" and ""Don't Speak"". It's not such a mainstream album as the latest ones. It's a big pitty they went away from their original style so much...."
3,"This is one of those albums that will never be forgotten. Even after you grow up and quit driving cheap sports cars and drinking till dawn with your friends, you'll hear a song from this CD and remember how good their music is. It's one of hundreds of CD's in my collection and every now and then I see it in my MP3 list and have to give it a whirl.Good stuff!"
3,"This is, by far, the best rock album ever. I originally bought this on tape, which broke from a decade of overplaying. So, I upgraded to cd. To this day, it's in the changer in my car, and I blast it shamelessly like I was some IROC driving mid-80s teenager.There is not a bad song on this album. I was always partial to ""side two"" though...starting with the song ""My Michelle."" ""I think about you"" is a really great song, with some great backing acoustic guitar. ""Rocket Queen"" is the best overall, with an awesome shift in attitude mid-song. And who can forget ""Sweet Child O' Mine"" with what I believe to be the best guitar solos ever, done by the master of the strings, Slash!When this was voted best rock album ever by Rolling Stone, it was the one and only time I agreed with their opinion. Any and every rock fan should own this cd."
3,"This album is pure fun from the start to the finish. GNR is actually very heavy metal influenced rock n roll and this stuff is pretty heavy. People, GNR is NOT HAIR METAL!! These guys are rock n roll metal! This is the best release from GNR and is a must have. you cant be a GNR fan without this CD!!!"
3,"This Is the BEST CD of the 80's this is also gotta be one of the best damn CD's ever. No CD i have ever listened to has impressed me this much. it starts out with welcome to the jungle and as soon as the guitar starts you know this is one helluva a band. then axl comes in with one of the best hard rock voices ever. There is no bad song on this album not one of them disapoints. My fav's are Welcome to the jungle, Nighttrain,Mr.Brownstone, Paradise City, My Michelle, Think a bout you, sweet child o' mine and rocket queen, hell there all great. and after listening to this album think of how great Guns could of been if Izzy never left. NOW BUY THE ALBUM"
3,"This is perhaps the best rock album of all time. Guns n' Roses may be inconsistent and sometimes their ideas can get in the way of their music talent but here they blend perfectly. Welcome to the Jungle is awesome and has awesome guitar and rhythm and everything. The legendary Sweet Child of also has great guitar rhythm and is a great pure song. paradise city is another great mix of sound and songwriting perfection. Nighttrain, out ta get me, brownstone, my Michelle, think about you and others are swweet tunes as well."
3,"Guns N Roses started out in 1985 in California and in that same year recorded a live EP. Than in 1986 they got a record deal with Geffen and recorded what would be known as, ""Appetite For Destrucion"". Perhaps one of the greatest heavy metal albums of all time and by far the best GNR album there is out there. Every song on here is just great. A true classic album.All the songs sound really good and all the instruments do too. Some key tracks on here are, Welcome To The Jungle, Sweet Child O Mine, Paradise City, and many more.1. Welcome To The Jungle 5/5 stars2. Its So Easy 5/5 stars3. Nightrain 5/5 stars4. Outa Get Me 5/5 stars5. Mr. Brownstone 5/5 stars6. Paradise City 5/5 stars7. My Michelle 5/5 stars8. Think About You 4.5/5 stars9. Sweet Child O Mine 5/5 stars10. Your Crazy 4.2/5 stars11. Anything Goes 5/5 stars12. Rocket Queen 5/5 stars"
3,"I bought this for someone who is into Guns 'n' Roses as well as Queen, Led Zepellin, and a lot of other hard rock and heavy metal groups. He had their second album, which he also plays regularly, but he said if I could get him any cd as a gift he wanted ""Appetite for Destruction"" because it had all of the band's best hits. I do not listen to this genre of music often but I did enjoy it. ""Welcome to the Jungle"", ""Nightrain"", ""Paradise City"", and ""Sweet Child O'Mine"" were the ones that stood out to me and I think they were all singles but the rest of the album is on the same line as the previously mentioned songs. I recommend it for anyone who likes rock, hard rock, and heavy metal or wants to buy a gift for someone who does. Even if you normally dislike the genre, you can't help but nod your head to a few of the tracks."
3,"During the first few moments of ""Welcome To The Jungle"" you can almost anticipate what this album is going to be like. From the police siren scream by Axl on Jungle to the very last solo on ""Rocket Queen"" this album packsa powerful punch throughout. The two guitar tandem of Izzy Stradlin and Slash rips out riffs better than almost anybody and bassist Duff Mckagan and Drummer Steve Adler keep the groove going throughout as Axl tells tales of the big city life. This is a fantastic album by any standard but the fact that it was their debut doubles its greatness. Standout Tracks like ""Sweet Child O' Mine"",""Paradise City"" and ""My Michelle"" have killer hooks riffs and lyrics. This is a must buy. Too bad this band couldn't have made more music like this."
3,"The movie is a truly great video for those who don't know the protocol that goes on behind the scenes when a Combat Veteran, who dies in combat, returns home for burial. One of the ending scenes that will bring many Nam Vets to tears, happens when Chance's, father, does his walk by of the coffin at the cemetery. Welcome Home My Brothers!"
3,Awesome movie. Everyone should see this. It will make you appreciate the sacrifice others have made so that we can be free.
3,"Sincerely, Kevin Bacon deserves an Oscar for this movie! I'm an ARMY wife, so I'm very proud to see this kind of documentary available. Our troops needs our support and prayers!"
3,Great movie that should be wached by many. I would definitely recommend this movie to other people out there. Enjoy it
3,"An incredibly moving movie. [This may kill the review, but it also was in good taste - the officer's fall from grace never came, and the deceased Marine's reputation was never sullied.]"
3,"""Taking Chance"" was possibly the most beautifully done movie I've ever seen. Period. My respect for the Armed Forces has always been at the top. I want to thank service men and women, of the past, present, and future. Also, I'd like to thank their families and friends. Freedom is never free and many people take their freedom for granted.The respect showed for the Marine Corps and the fallen Marine throughout this film humbled me. I would recommend this movie 100 times over, to buy or rent, simply as a reminder of what your freedom costs and as a reminder to respect those who serve.Beautifully written. Terrific and heartfelt acting. Emotionally strong.Fantastic."
3,"Taking Chance is a humanitarian story involving a little known part of a soldier's loss of life. Inspired by the true story of United States Marine, Lieutenant Colonel Michael Strobl, who volunteered to escort the remains of a nineteen year old soldier (Lance Corporal Chance Phelps) who was killed during active duty in Iraq to his final resting place in distant Wyoming. Strobel, (Kevin Bacon) makes it his personal mission to prepare this young soldier for his journey home with respectful honor while gaining further insight of human sacrifice. A compassionate story."
3,"This movie was as close to reality as you can get. I lost my son, Marine Lance Corporal Nathaniel Schultz in August 2010. The Marines never leave a man behind. The Marine who accompanied my son home, was exactly like the character that Kevin Bacon played. See the movie. It is well worth watching. I'm glad I saw it before my son's deployment though."
3,"I'll be honest. I have absolutely no interest in this kind of music and I only bought the CD coz it has the song 'Betcha Never' from the animated movie Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman. It's a very cool song indeed and since a soundtrack CD of said movie is not available I ended up getting this for that one song only.Most of Cherie's songs on this CD are the typically cliched songs any female singer does. All about falling in love, breaking up, being scornful towards past lovers, longing for past lovers, etc. A couple of them are good, such as 'Older Than My Years', which is a great example of Cherie's powerful voice and singing talent. 'Body, Soul and Heart' is also quite good but 'Betcha Never' has the best melody and feeling to it.A quicktime video of 'I'm Ready' is included on the CD."
3,"I had been looking for a Whistler book, and this was simply the best one that I was able to track down. It includes the color images of the artist's best-klnown works, including his portraits, nocturnes, and etchings. The text is informative and comprehensive. My only complaint is that many of the images were smaller than I would have liked. When I get a book like this, the artwork is the main draw--not the text. More full-page images would have been nice."
3,It warms the wax that rips out my hairs. This is painful. Occasionally there is blood but at least no more hair. The bad stuff is not the product's fault. It does what it's supposed to do and does it well.
3,"I love this CD because i think ska is so cool, and if you love their first CD you will probably love this one too! this was an even bigger flop than the first one, (it only sold 1,000 copies in the first week that it was out)but its still pretty cool you should check it out. I love no doubt im their number one fan!"
3,"This is just a great CD, you can listen to it straight through over and over, or just a few songs at a time that you'll find stuck in your head. My favorites are ""By the Way"", ""Blue in the Face"", ""Open the Gate"", and ""Stricken"". This is a great album, goes really well with Tragic Kingdom and their title album."
3,"This is a very good book for someone that is learning life drawing, it gives very good suggestions on proportions and how to measure the figure. It's illustrations are not the best but it is very informative."
3,These movies were a lot of fun. I know the are not new to the screen but nice action and plot. A good value.
3,"Not such a big fan of Boy Scout, but I love Last Man. I saw it in the theater and loved it. It wasn't much of a hit with mainstream audiences, but it's still a great Bruce Willis film. If you like westerns/gangster films, you'll enjoy it. Light on the extras, but the price justifies that."
3,"Beautiful pictures, informed text! Collectors use this ""Bible"" as a reference to describe their Mexican folk art.Most of the information is unavailable in other books.Plus, the book is gorgeous."
3,"Some really good songs on this one and great production/sound. Not quite as solid as ""Two sides to every story"" or ""Do not disturb"" (which are both solid from start to finish) but still worth picking it up."
3,I left these practices years ago and this book hits the nail right on the head. Excellent reading - won't be able to put this book down. Recommended reading for all Pentecostals and Charasmatics.
3,"Thank You, Kevin Reeves for writing this book!!!A MUST READ BOOK if you are searching for truth. Find truth and stop being deceived. I wish everyone in ""churches"" that are being deceived could read this. I have fell for the same things this books talks about. Something in me knew better but believed and trusted those that I thought were more superior and knew more than I. I put my believes and trust in ""man's religion"", ""churches"", their ideas and thoughts, instead of God's word and proving the word for myself. ddj"
3,it had good shipping speed arrived in three days. The book for what it was and it's condition was way expensive.
3,"I was actually looking for additional information on the process of truing a bicycle wheel, and building rims from scratch. This book allowed me to do more then that. This is worth its weight in gold. Forget the local bike shop (not that i dont believe in putting back into the economy, buy your tires and parts from them!!!) when it comes to expensive repairs. Put it next to your Chilton. The only book you will ever need on every aspect of EVERY problem you will come across in your cyclist lifetime. Would buy again."
3,"I wasn't even going to look at Mr. LaPierre's book until I saw the simplistic and grammatically challenged ""review"" posted by one ""Arthur Hayhoe."" If the only ""review"" this guy can dish up is comprised almost exclusively of his own warmed-over leftist ideology and revisionist history, then LaPierre must be on to something."
3,"Got this to loosen up a tight IT band in my legs. Seems to be working well enough, and I've also started using it to massage my calves and hip-flexors before/after exercising. It's definitely more useful than I gave it credit for. Very sturdy. Exactly what I was hoping for when I ordered. Good price point too."
3,The foam roller arrived within the expected time. It is very firm and just the right size for my exercises.
3,"I ordered the standard firmness (white-color) 36"" x 6"" round foam roller from Exertools through Amazon.com. It came quicker than expected using standard shipping. With shipping it cost 1/2 of what they cost at my local sporting good store and a Big Box retailer.This roller is the right firmness for doing Iliotibial band stretching exercises. So far it is holding up well. If you aren't sharing the rooler with others or using it on a dirty floor then you probably don't need a slip-on fabric cover for the roller."
3,"I'm new to foam rolling - started it a month ago with my P90X2 routine. I bought the official P90X2 grey roller, but needed a second since my husband and I are both doing the routine. This roller is longer than the grey one that comes with P90X2 (that's a plus, especially for my 6' 4"" husband) but just as firm and comfy (and a lot cheaper). The point of this is to roll you trouble spots on the roller to ease out any muscle discomfort. The first time I did it I felt ridiculous rolling around in odd positions on the floor, but now I love it! I use this on my lower back (chronic disc pain) and neck most often and it really helps the ache go away for a long time. It's also great for upper back/lat soreness. If you've never foam rolled before and have aches, I really recommend this roller."
3,"Not only is there not a bad song on the entire album, but there are some real gems to be heard here. Figure Number Five, Light the Torch, Departure Plan, Distortion Sleep and Downfall 24 are all amazing songs. This album beats out Natural Born Chaos not only because of the number of great songs on it, but because, as mentioned earlier, there isn't a single bad song on it. However, this isn't the most amazing stuff I've ever heard, so it gets 4/5 stars."
3,"Soilwork has become one of the top European metal bands in the last few years, and Figure Number Five shows why. It is an album that shows a cohesive unit turning out solid pieces. While more melodic than their first four releases, it still retains the heaviness. The rhythm section is near flawless, especially Ranta's drumming, while the melodic section, keyboard and guitar, churn out a melody that is not overbearing but still clearly defined. The vocals have gotten better, with Strid seemingly have developed a greater range since NBC. Some of the key cuts to look at on this album is the title track, the opening track ""Rejection Role"", ""Brickwalker"" and ""Cranking the Sirens"". The first two lean towards the heavier end of the album, while the last two lean more towards the style shown on NBC's ""As We Speak,"" which is a song that really helped the band to make a big break.And if you can, catch these guys live... it's an awesome show."
3,"You can read this book for the entertainment factor of the many stories or for lessons on how to recognize and use insights - those thoughts that represent a shift in the way you see the world. Dusenberry has an interesting perspective that I haven't seen elsewhere. If you really want to learn from his book, though, you'll need to do your own work pulling the key ideas out as he chose to write more of a narrative. It won't be a hardship because the book is worth reading more than once. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
3,"This novel was more than I could have hoped for in a suspense/legal thriller. The characters and plot are so vivid that I felt that I knew each person and the role they played personally. The plot is realistic yet very intriguing. As a fan of James Patterson, John Grisham, Tom Clancy etc. I strongly recommend ""Directed Verdict"". It reads like a NY Times bestseller and delivers a power-packed, uplifting message of hope for every reader!! This is a very, very good book."
3,I cannot say enough about this book.....if there were 10 stars I would give it a 10...I was spellbound all the way through the book. Directed Verdict should be a must read if you like legal thrillers. Randy Singer is a great writer.
3,Shows reliable holding power. Withstood 11 ton vessel in 35 knot winds. Dries up rapidly when soaked. Allows minimal stretch. Recommend shafing protection around pilings.
3,"True to size fit, very well made, long lasting. This is my third pair and will get two more this month. Very good price, a real bargain. Love the side pockets. Slow to fade."
3,The item shipped in a timely fashion and the jeans fit perfectly! Very happy with this purchase and buying experience.
3,"I just picked this little gem up for 50 cents at a thrift store. Wow...Great, Ultra-creative and sublime, I would buy this thing if it were $50"
3,"i live in brooklyn and after doing our research my boyfriend and i decided to get this lock set- we weren't disappointed. solid quality lock that is still light and easy to bring around with you (unlike those kryptonite chains you see people riding around with wearing them like midevil torture belts) we've never had a problem- the only thing i would want to upgrade is that the cord is a bit short for my bike, though my boyfriend ha had not problem- i just got an additional cord- no problem..."
3,"It does the job, I guess? How do you determine the quality of a lock? Hire a thief to try to break it? In the 3 weeks I have used this lock, my tractor has remained on the side of the barn and I used the extra cable as a belt to hold up my jeans."
3,"Yup, this is a big one! I can't imagine ANYONE being able to steal a bike (if you attach it like they tell you to with the cable) or your front wheel/tire -- and you don't have to take it off the fork to secure it!!! That's a shortcoming with a lock that DOESN'T include a cable. Even with a quick-release front wheel, it's a pain to take it off and then put it back on (straight) when you return to your bike. But if you don't have a way to carry this thing, you might decide it's too big and bulky. I've decided it's worth the trouble of lugging it around, but then I ride in the city and prefer to have a bike to ride rather than an empty front fork -- or worse -- an empty bike rack."
3,"excellent value. the dimensions are also helpful, as it can be cut for any purpose. Standard quality at, by far, the best price."
3,"""The Innocents"" is without doubt one of the best ghost films (or is it a study in psychopathology?) ever made. Unfortunately, in this video format, almost half of the picture is missing! It was shot in Cinemascope for showing on a wide screen. On video, we are deprived of much of the visual beauty and drama. We see actors speaking into empty space, while offscreen voices answer. Just as bad, we may see two noses conversing! The marketing department at Fox should wake up. There are people who want to see ALL of the movie....."
3,"I finally ordered it from Amazon after years of not seeing it on TV.I was so glad I did. This haunting tale and it's haunting melody has lived with me for over 30 years. If you love a good, old-fashioned ghost story ... this one is for you."
3,I totally enjoyed this book. I have seen a movie adaptation and it did not live up to the book.In the book the reader can create the horriable experiment gone wrong.I recommend this book.A must read
3,"I've recently purchased and seen the entire first season of ""The Big Gay Sketch Show"".And I've simply adored this lovable show!Hilarious sketches, cute, sassy & funny characters.With a hint of sweetness... Intelligent!Superbly written, with great, beautiful and funny actresses & actors...Most of all, it is deliciously ""Very GLBT"" in texture & flavours guaranteed to please all..."" GLBT Diversity at its best!""Brilliant & great entertainment!I do recommend ""All Seasons Available"" of this delightful Logo wonder called ""The Big Gay Sketch Show"" ! ! !Sky a.k.a. JD Aeon - GLBT MTF Pagan Wiccan Witch Shaman & Occultist"
3,"This is a great camera for the price. Durable, grat photo quality, easy to use."
3,This book is recommended by Jim Trelease in his read-aloud handbook. I used to check it out of the library every year to read to my class of second graders. They loved it!
3,"I needed to buy a stethoscope for my nursing class and chose this one so that I would know it's MINE. Everyone else in my class had the typical looking stethoscope. It's definitely a conversation starter and grabs people's attention. The only thing about it is that the heart is a bit LARGER than it appears in the picture. Other than that, I am very satisfied with this product!"
3,"I was searching for this exact gift to give to a friend of mine, who is a nurse, & found this & it was exactly what she wanted! She was very happy w her gift"
3,"I've been using this for menopause symptoms - heavy cycles that are prolonged and coming too close together - and this truly seems to be ""regulating"" my cycles. My cycles have not been as painful or heavy since I've been using the cream and they are back on track to every 25-28 days. The scent is pleasant as well."
3,The book shares pertinent information about the importance of light - good light - full spectrum daylight for humans. Am replacing all lighting to daylight throughout the house.
3,"This book was one of extensive drama, detailed almost gostly decriptions of suspects and characters in book, descriptions that allow one to follow the drama of a typical small town murder, with all suspects known to simi retired, homicide investigator who moved to a small town to work without the hassle of the big city he removed himself from. Police Drama at its best!! Lt. D. Kilpatrick Chief Investigator"
3,"This book outlines Galen Rowell's attempt on K-2. Rarely does a book bring together pictures, text and feeling as this one does. Along with Pete Boardman's Shining Mountain, I rate this among the best mountaineering books out there. This one is destined to become a cult classic"
3,"This Olympus camera has a good feel, produces a good picture, and is easy to use. What's not to like?"
3,Being someone who has woked with NT for several years this book is a requirement. Those that are looking for fun overview reading are looking in the wrong place. The detail on the NT registry and Performance monitoring is not to be found anywhere else. I couldn't live without it.
3,These speakers work great. Installed them on my CBR600RR and they sound clean. They are definetly the best bang for your buck when it comes to 3.5 coax speakers
3,"I have always enjoyed this movie, memorable songs and a step back into the past. Musicals seem to be something one can watch (and listen to) over and over again."
3,"Sit back and enjoy getting caught up in a Walter Mitty type of happy success-in-business story that you will enjoy every moment of! The casting is so perfect you will wonder how these people could have been found to play their parts in such a very perfect way. Robert Morse stars in the role that he was born to play and Michele Lee can rightfully be called Miss Yum-Yum for her performance! Music is great and with the clever lyrics what more could anyone want? For a fun romp in a ""kinder than real life"" business world, this is it. A joy from beginning to end."
3,"When Viscount Desford comes upon a young lady walking to London, he stops to ask her where she is going. Charity says she is running away to her Grandfather, so the Viscount vows to help her find her eccentric relative and ends up travelling all over England looking for them. The rather funny antics of Charity and the Viscounts difficult search make a funny story. The outcome is filled with fate, but it all ends well. It is all Georgette Heyer!"
3,"I don't suffer from IBS, but I do eat a lot of spicy food that sometimes upsets my stomach. This product is great for alleviating that. Just drink some dissolved in juice afterward or before you go to bed. No more worrying about whether or not my stomach will start burning. I have gone through 2 cans so far. With the first can, for some reason, the powder wasn't dissolving well, but it still worked. The second can was much more soluble. Either way, it works!"
3,"I've been using Heather's tummy fiber for only 4 days, and I am already feeling some relief from my IBS-D. I also highly recommend the peppermint tummy tea, it's very soothing and tastes wonderful. I haven't had any problems with the fiber dissolving, I simply add 1/2 tsp. to a little water, stir with a fork, wait, stir some more, and then add more water. It has almost NO flavor. A work friend recommended this product, and I'm very grateful that she did. She claims that it completely resolved her gas and bloating issues due to IBS."
3,a good book for classic autism. my son has pdd nos and it is to stereotyped for him to relate to the character.
3,This book covers the basics of Biology. It really prepares you for the SAT II. It covers each area and explains it in ENGLISH!!! =) Plus it includes exercises along the way to help remember all the concepts.
3,"Pros: the magnification works well, without distortion. The mirror is light and easy to transport if needed.Cons: the touch-light base does not work well for me as I constantly hit it by accident when applying makeup."
3,"The fourth book in the Helmsman series finds Wilf Brim as skipper of his own starship based on the racing hull of the last book. Due to politics, the crew ends up as Mercenaries on the far flung Fluvannian star system. Bewitched by his old love Margot, Brim sires a child and battles the League.Baldwin continues the saga of the Helmsman using his deft touch of technical and piloting jargon to carry the reader through the plot. Dedicated fans of the Helmsman will enjoy the read. New readers should start with'The Helmsman' or 'Galactic Convoy' or many of the plot interplays are lost.A fine read, but clearly the middle book of a series with all of the faults and traits such a books has. Some mature descriptions of Brim's love life"
3,Card is super. Holds approx 249 1200 x 800 pictures. Would hold much more at a different setting.
3,"I received the digital card right away, installed it with no problem, and has been excellent since then. It was a fantastic value and I recommend it to everyone!"
3,I used my 512MB in my mobile phone (Motorola mpx 200) and it works flawlessly. I've used in a Viking Intelliflash 6-in-1 memory card reader and no problems. I even used the same card in a Kodak CX6200 and Canon Optura DV camera and it worked with no problems. I would highly recommend this card.I bought a 128MB version for my girlfriend's digital camera and it works just as great as the 512MB.Compare this to a SanDisk SD card I have which won't read at all in the Optura camera. With the SanDisk I had all sorts of problems with files being erased and not being properly written. This is not fun when all your pictures get erased when you put the card in another device and the card suddenly becomes unreadable.
3,The order was filled promptly and was shipped before they said it would be here. Excellant service.
3,"Kingston SD is an OEM version of Toshiba SD, they are slower than the Panasonic version (Lexar, Simpletech, etc), but Kingston SDs are considerably cheaper than them. I have both Panasonic and Kingston SDs and satisfied with both of them. Although it takes longer time to transfer files between PC and SD card through the card readers, Kingston SD so far have given me no errors or reliability problems. Highly recommended for the budget!!!"
3,I didn't realize that this was based on a true story until after we watched it. What a great story. I recommend this one to anyone with kids!
3,"First of all... To ""James from England"" Are you absolutely sure you actually read the book? The review sounds REALLY different from the book.In my opinion, this book was extremely WONDERFUL but REALLY sad. I would SO spoil it if I told you the end. This book actually left me crying! REALLY REALLY READ IT! (but I advise you read Mossflower and Redwall first) I can't stress this enough: READ THIS BOOK!!!(you get the point, right?)"
3,"Martin the Warrior is my favorite book by Brian Jacques. I have read all of his books and this one is the best. Matin's fighting spirit is amazing. I love when Martin gets his sword back from Badrang, It's great. Well I don't want to say to much more because I would't want to ruin the story for you."
3,"This book is my favorite(So far). It tells the exiting story of a young mouse, Martin son of Luke the Warrior, who gets enslaved by an evil Tyrant, Badrang. Badrang takes Martins sword, and makes the young mouse work to build a fortress. Martin breaks free with some help from Feldoh, Brome, Rose, and Grumm. An exiting adventure that will make you laugh, cry, and cheer!"
3,I was hoping I could have the screen name Martin but the A.O.L staff only let me have Mart. Well what I have to say about this story is.That this was the best book I have ever read in my whole entire life.It kind of had a message that no matter how young or old you are you can still be brave and couragous.
3,"This is the best book I have ever read, and I have read quite a few (including all of the Redwall books, even the Great Redwall Feast). I think that Martin is the coolest (well, second coolest) character in any of the BJ books. Skarlath from the Outcast is the coolest. Anyway, I make it a point to read this book about once every 3 months. I'll probably have to get a new copy soon if I'm not careful, and I should be careful, because Brian Jacques himself autographed mine!"
3,Martin the Warrior is a suspensful action packed book. Martin the main character is caught at a young age by a Tyrant called Badrang. He escapes from Badrangs slave compound and swears to Badrang he will be back to get his fathers sword which was taken from him. The mouse goes through a lot of hardships and returns to Fort Marshank where Badrang lived at the end of the book and I can't tell you the rest.
3,Please just READ THIS BOOK! and the rest of the Redwall series. Just do it. The characters seem almost human! Please? You don't know what you're missing!
3,"The mix between Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, and Grace Kelly are amazing. What a wonderful film to be Grace Kelly's last before she became (her royal HIGHness) It is certainly a movie to be seen."
3,"Quantum-Touch really resonated with me - I have studied many healing modalities from Reiki to Lomi-Lomi and found Quantum-Touch to be the most powerful yet easiest way to understand and practice hands on healing. Quantum-Touch is fun to read, and de-mystifies hands on healing by describing pratical ways to work with life-force energy. The Quantum-Touch video is fantastic as well. I used the techniques on my Dad who had a lung infection for the past 8 years. After a few hours of Quantum-Touch, his infection was 95% clearer and is still clear a month later. I've seen lots of other awesome results as well : ""healing"" bruised ribs, eliminating sciatica pain, releiving all sorts of pain, bringing down bunions, etc. etc. The fun part about this work is that anyone can learn it; my friends who have learned QT have had great results as well."
3,"This book is an excellent book based on energy healing. It takes the reader through simple exercises and meditations that can help them learn and understand how to use this life force for healing themselves and others. This material perfectly compliments the other fields of energy work including but not limited to pranic healing, reiki healing, energy medicine, etc. If you are curious about energy work I recommend that you start with this book."
3,"This is a great CD if you are looking for pure pop. The only song I dislike is 'Don't Turn of the Lights'.....it is more or less wailing to music. 'Hero' is a good track, but annoying since we've only heard it a million times in weeks following 9/11."
3,I look forward to reading Diane Mott Davidson with great gusto. Tough Cookie once again meets up to her high standard. Her books are generally a casual read but not predictable and the villian is not easily determined. This is not a cookbook and I am not looking for Einstein receipes but good entertainment about a loving family sticking together thru it all. I wish there was another book by her now and anxiously await her next.
3,"Wow. So i bought this Cd and couldnt beleive that it was actually good. As most bands go, they usually have a great debut bad have a crappy followup. But now i see that it isnt actually always true.Even though this CD is Great, the first CD was better. I recommend this cd but if you buy it, you should buy their debut too if you dont have it."
3,"Some people have complained about the image quality but i think its good for the money i paid. PLease dont compare this camera with others like Olympus Ultra zoom, they are in different categories.CONS: The bad thing on this camera NO AUDIO IN VIDEO MODE.PROS:-VERY EASY TO USE-Low price-It can be carry in a pants pocket"
3,The book is used and was in a very excellent condition. Absolutely like new. I would always trust this seller.
3,"Do you want your hair to have a beautiful shine? This product is the answer! It may not work for everyone, but it has been nearly a miracle for me."
3,"I can't say enough about this product - I use it before I put the hot iron to my hair, and the finished result is great. Smooth, no frizz and I truly believe it is protecting my hair as well as making it incredibly shiny without weighing it down or making it look too greasy."
3,"The earlier reviewers have given a very good description of the enjoyment offered by this disc. I only want to add that ""A Northern Song"" by Adam Carse is exquisite - a lovely melody that is gentle, peaceful and evocative of a sunset in the English countryside. It could be mistaken for the work of Elgar or Vaughan Williams. Don't miss it!"
3,"This whole CD is simply amazing. The different instruments used and the voices all blend together to form a great CD. I use some of the music from the CD in the yoga classes I teach. I also just enjoy listening to the whole CD because each song is so good, I don't have to skip any. It makes for enjoyable listening. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a hip, Indian beat."
3,"I bought this radio because I was worried about my Sportster being in the car on hot days. I am very happy with my radio. It couldn't be simpler. Don't expect a Bose but it's great for the money. The only way it could be better is if it had the AM/FM built in for the day I retire my satellite subscription.I exchanged a high tech radio/dock from a dept. store because I wanted something that was easy to move from room to room and rugged enough to take a few bumps along the way:) This is the radio. And without a lot of buttons (3 to be exact, I'm not afraid to let the kids (7 & up)touch it!PLEASE NOTE: Since there is an antenna it is important to know that I am in an open location. And, yes, it plays great outside too!"
3,"This is an excellent book that summarizes a lot of what is currently known about the coral snakes (Micrurus + Micruroides). The Amazon.com summary pretty much says it all. It is certainly not cheap in comparison to say Cambpell + Lamar's book but there you go. One MAJOR criticism regards the presentation of the photographs. In comparison with the rather professionally presented text, the photographs might as well be from a children's book a couple of decades old (needs to be seen to be believed!). However, the text more than makes up for this."
3,"A unique glimpse into one of classicals music's historical moments...the recording of the Ring cycle. Hear the voices and see the people who made this event happen. Even if you have the older VHS, get this DVD."
3,"I've just watched it and I must say that it's one of those movies that you can't really read or ask about what it's like or if it's good or bad. You must watch it and make your own opinion. I didn't watch the clean/catholic version and, to be honest, I don't see why anybody would want to watch an edited movie. I gave it five stars because it is totally worth watching so that you can have an opinion of your own about it. That's why I'm not even saying whether or not I thought the sex/mutilation/torture scenes were needless or justified or if I think the movie deserved to be made or not."
3,"VON TRIER NEVER THHINKS THINGS IN ORDINARY WAYS. I DON'T FEEL TOO SHOCKING ABOUT ANTICHRIST. HOWEVER, IT'S REALLY HARD TO UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE PLOT. WHY DID CRITERION CHOOSE IT RIGHT AWAY?"
3,"Talk about shocking. What a starling and visual way to display love, grief, and passionate crazy. For a movie ultimately about death it sure is sexual (but it's between married people so I guess it makes sense). Visually beautiful as well."
3,"I remembered this from when I was a kid, and I loved it when I was a kid, and I don't have the same passion for it now, but I'm glad I bought it. Still a good 30 minute movie to watch with you family."
3,"Pursuit includes the point of view from the dupes.meanwhile the 6 teens are still running from the law, but it seems instead of learning from past mistakes they have become slightly careless, through their emails to their parents, the FBI tracks them. Meanwhile the Fbi captures the dupes, thinking that they captured the real podsquad. The dupes and the real roswell gang have a couple of near misses with the FBI, very tense and exciting, litterally felt like my heart was hanging from the clothesline. It is hinted at the end that the podsquad and co. are through running and hiding, they're getting ready to fight, this decision made from Liz's new vision. This book is a little more funnier than the others, but is gripped with suspense, romantically wise though it was a big disappointment."
3,Excellent book - very well written and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Actually hated for it to end.
3,"The Bushido fights were based on action, this is a great formula if the styles fit. Team Japan vs. Gracie is rather slow until the young Gracies ,especially Ryan (R.I.P.), add a spark. The second disc is Japan vs. Chute Boxe so here is the action, not only does Chute Boxe Academy live up to it's name, Team Japan seems to respond making close matches. The third is less themed as in teams competing but all discs include great bouts outside the teams featuring Cro Cop and other greats. Remember, this revolves around action, so mostly fast stand-ups."
3,"This DVD was not at all what I expected or wanted. I liked the video and the information and recipes were all good. However, I had a hardcopy of the book by the same title and was hoping to gain an electronic copy of that book. I like to be able to search electronically for specific information or recipes. This DVD has a few new recipes but they were very hard to get back to if one did not copy them by hand when they were first viewed. It was nice hearing Dr. Ornish discuss his program but I already knew all that information from his previous books. I am still looking for electronic versions of all his approved recipes or new research he has done on diet improvements. For someone who has not read his works this is an excellent introduction."
3,"I'm tired of people saying bad things about Stonedhenge. I don't understand why so many people knock this album. TYA rocks, and so does Stonedhenge. I have many TYA albums and Stonedhenge gets played more than most of them. I admit some of the songs like Ric Lee's ""Three Blind Mice,"" doesn't do much for the album, but a few of the other songs are some of my TYA favorites. I also happen to like Leo's bass solos. Whatever you do, don't knock this album before you hear it, you may be pleasantly surprised."
3,"BUT! Now Brother Cadfael belongs to history, and the readers who love him so.Start at the beginning and READ THIS SERIES! Miss Peters had an unparalleled gift for conjuring the most beautiful images with her words. I mean, how many people can write about the grim and gritty middle ages and almost make you want to live there? When Cadfael digs in his garden and breathes in the scent of his herbs, you are there, my friend.In this volume we again meet Olivier, Cadfael's son. That would make it worth buying alone, but we also get a brilliant story with EP's usual marvelous characters. What a marvelous ending to this stand-out series."
3,"I bought this CD only liking the song ""Praise You"", and having never heard the other two songs, but now they are some of my favorites. This is a amazing CD, and the remix of ""Rockafeller Skank"" really puts the icing on the cake. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who likes Fat Boy Slim, or to anyone who likes good music in general!"
3,"Although the text was too short and didn't provide my advanced language arts students with enough information, it did inspire them to investigate each of the topics further. It is a good starting point for learning. I don't agree with all of the theories in the book."
3,"Oooh, is this an awesome toothbrush! It really does massage your gums as you brush - I've never felt anything like it. It's just incredible, especially since I have sensitive, bleeding gums and most brushes just irritate my mouth. This one doesn't do any of that - just massages as you brush. Great, great product -wish it had been out years ago! Highly, highly, highly recommend!"
3,...I got a hunch about 1/2 way through that one of the characters was the murderer - but could not even begin to see how they did it or were connected. My first read of a Christie book - and I'll be digging in to others since I enjoyed this one so much.
3,"I have read everyone of Agatha Christie's novels, short stories, plays, etc. and truly, nobody writes a better mystery. Classic and always interesting, I re-read this book whenever I just need a good read."
3,"A wonderful story about a newly divorced mom striving to build a new life for herself and her son in San Francisco, she joins a choir who will be performing Handel's Messiah as a Christmas concert and becomes involved in the lives of many fascinating people. Romance, mystery, tension, and wonderful music. This one should be a classic!"
3,After The Much Flawed The Tuxedo He's Back And Better Than Ever. This Is Funnier Than The First Surprisingly. It's Also Refreshing To See Jackie Chan Back As Chon Wang Say It Fast Yall And Owen Wilson As Roy O Bannon In Their First Great Movies Since Shanghai Noon. This Has References To Many Famous Figures. The Little Kids Name Was Charlie Chaplin. Arthur Conan Doyle Grew To Be A Famous Writer. Big Ben Is A Very Famous Clock In London. Every Fan Of Shanghai Noon Should See This.
3,"I have uses product for the last 10 years it takes out the swirls anything that's fine or on the top of the paint will remove it never have a problem with this company they stand behind their productthe one thing I noticed with Meguiar's their bottles are getting cheaper don't drop them store them in a cool environment and dark Place, within the year the bottle will deteriorate keep an eye on this if this happens poured out into another container"
3,"This is not your typical academic book, I mean this in a good way!It contains a lot of information but, it reads like a novel and it is truly good.M. Starbird takes of a more personnal approach in her research on Mary Magdalen and the result is amazing. A lot of books on Mary Magdalen tend to repeat the same thing over and over. I have read about forty of them and the gist of them is the same. It was not the case this time and I learn plenty of new things.I also recommend her follow up book."
3,"The software that comes with this mouse is great, especially since it allows you to assign different uses for the buttons for each program you use. This greatly increases the functionality of this mouse and eases the burden on my wrists. The only drawback is that the size is too large for small hands like mine. So perhaps it will force me to purchase another one to prevent my carpel tunnel from getting worse instead of helping. I'm waiting to see."
3,My husband and I have been using this mouse for years and absolutely love it! This one was a Christmas present for our daughter and she can't thank us enough....she is so happy with it.
3,"This is an excellent mouse. The shape is great and I love the Forward and Back buttons that you can push with your thumb. The only thing I don't like is the Search button near your fore finger. I tend to bump it by accident and a new browser window pops open. But that function can be disabled. Also, the extended battery life is awesome. I bought this a month ago and have not replaced the batteries. The mouse that this one replaced was getting so bad that it wasn't even a week for a set of batteries.Overall, a really great wireless mouse!"
3,"I've had this mouse for over 2 years and it remains my favorite. It has a nice shape that's comfortable for right handers and a one touch search key that you can set to google anything you highlight which I have found really handy and have since set a button on my other mouses to do the same. It's still working perfectly though the sliding surfaces on the bottom are a little worn, the hyperscroll and all the buttons still work perfectly. In terms of battery life, this mouse consistently lasts longer than my logitech anywhere mx mouse. The only bad thing about this mouse is that it doesn't use the logitech unifying usb receiver. Overall I'd still recommended it today if a good deal can be found."
3,"This book is excellent for anyone writing books, newspaper articles, blog pages, etc. since it helps correct mistakes in usage."
3,"I really like this book. I wish it had more action/adventure, but it is really good."
3,The Cricket in time square is a worderful book about... A mouse that lives in a pipe in subway that is named Tucker. One day in new York late at night a boy that sells newspapers and magizes. He heard a chriping noise. he ran to see what it was. The noise was coming from the trash can. He Dug in the trash can and he saw a crricket.
3,"This book was about a cricket named Chester, who used to live in Connecticut, but was brought to New York City in someone's picnic basket. A boy named Mario found him and took good care of him. When Mario found out that Chester had a talent in chirping, everyone in New York City knew about him. Business became good for Mario and his parents, but Chester wasn't happy. He didn't like to be looked at and he didn't get to be with Mario. In this book, you never knew what was going to happen next. I liked it because it had animals as characters. What I didn't like about it was that the book didn't have jokes."
3,I bought this set of CDs two years ago for my daughter. She likes to listen to books-on-CD at night while she is going to sleep. I have bought a number of CDs and I have to say that this is one of the better ones. She still listens to it 2 years later!
3,1968 was an annus horribilis. It was partially redeemed by Apollo 8 and the famous earth-rise photo. This performance of Opus 10 was recorded just weeks after the assassination of Robert Kennedy. It is suffused with melancholy and foreboding - even the Goldfinch 'sings but not from joy'. The Fantasmi in La Notte are minatory and no Plymouth Rock is in sight in La Tempesta di Mare. The Largo of No. 4 in G Major could serve as a reliquary for the Age of Aquarius.Severino Gazzelloni plays with great artistry. The flute is not the most expressive of instruments; the soloist evokes a more lachrymose palette than usual. He is superbly accompanied by I Musici and the recording is first class. I have yet to hear another performance of Opus 10 that is cut from the same cloth; please consider.
3,"Good book, very fact filled and well researched. The author was very knowledgeable about the subject, however it was a little more detailed than I wanted. It was written at a higher level than I would have liked. I believe the author was aiming for a more academic crowed, and I'm just a dabbler in this subject. I knew nothing about the subject and now I know a whole lot more.However, since I knew nothing to start with, I was very fascinated by the whole idea of the spirit of democracy of the time being manifest in the church of the time. Whether it was good or bad I will not give an opinion and the author did a good job of sticking to the facts and leaving his opinion out of the copy as much as possible.If this area of study interests you, I would recommend the book. If it's only a passing fancy of a possible interesting read, you might want to think twice."
3,"This was a really cute movie. I am in my 40s and watched the whole movie with my daughter. When I have kids over I put this movie on and they all stay still and watch it. Everyone enjoys it. Good family, friendly movie. Will recommend to anyone."
3,I received my order in record time--in good condtionThanks for the prompt service! I enjoy using Amazon and suggest to my friends that they do the same
3,I found this on Amazon for a great price. My daughter loves talking animals so I thought it would be worth it. She watches so much and the story is actually entertaining for adults.
3,This is a really funny movie! It is perfect for kids and adults. You won't be disappointed with this movie.
3,"This should be a reference Blu-ray disc in anyone's collection. The colors pop and sizzle. The detail in Horton's skin, the dust trail as the speck is first propelled on its journey of imminent doom, and the funky textures and hair of the Hoos bring out the best from a good 1080p setup. The movie itself has just the right mix of drama and comic relief - it's a thriller afterall!"
3,I typically buy movies when they first come out but because we have been a little low on money I have tried limiting my purchases so i was glad that i waited and bought this for him at a later date because it was such a great buy.
3,This is one of our favorite movies. Got it for the family for Christmas at such a great price. It arrived quickly and well packaged. Loved watching it on Christmas Day.
3,"The lethargy and ungodliness of the American campus, from the usury and money lending practices of the student loan to the preaching of secular humanism. Give 'em hell, Jed. Don't let the Ivory Towers steal your soul! DEUTERONOMY 15:2"
3,"I really like the band, so i decided to get this cd. The music is good, and if you like their previous songs, you will really like this one!"
3,"Although I got a second hand book, it looks as good as a new book. No tear or wear on the book.This book is an amazing one. This is the best book to learn about Data Warehousing. Ralph has described using the most real time scenarios.If you are new to Data Warehousing, I say you should definitely read this book. And if you are working, then you sure must go through the individual chapters based on domains. He has explained it very beautifully!!"
3,"Doug Swenson's Mastering the Secrets of Yoga Flow is for you if you are interested in starting a home practice or if you are wanting to incorporate yoga into more aspects of your life. Part II offers detailed, yet easy to follow instructions for asana practice, and covers sequencing and linking the asanas with vinyasas. The vinyasas give the routine its unique flavor, since Swenson connects one asana to another through tai chi-type movements that work with the energy of the natural environment. The book encourages creativity, giving the yogi choices of asanas from which to choose in designing a safe practice. I loved Part III the most, though, for its discussion on meditation, diet, cross-training, and bringing yoga into your daily life. In a very non-judgmental manner, Swenson describes how to progress to a diet plan that is healthy and life-sustaining. I expect to refer back to the book for years to come."
3,I love veggie tales and so do my kids! We watched this on Easter and really enjoyed it. It was streamed and we didn't have any problems with it!
3,"I own my own company and often when I was at business events, meetings. meals and the like, I'd find myself stymied by the proper way to handle the etiquette of the situation. From hand-shakes, to introductions, to presenting business cards, I was being tripped up and distracted away from the business at hand. Not any more. This book cleared up those murky waters for me. Now when I walk into business situations I know exactly what's expected of me and what to do about it. With that off my mind I'm completely focused on success."
3,The stylus actually matches my kindle cover and is lightweight and easy to use. No more messy fingerprints on the display screen.
3,"Who was the mysterious foreign woman who kept sneaking around? Why did she try to kidnap the young daughter of a tenant at the Sans Souci? Why was the Landlady acting so conspicuous? Why was everyone at the Sans Souci so mysterious? Was the old man who lived on the shore telling the truth about seeing signal lights across the water? Or was he lying?""N or M"" is one of Agatha Christie's best books. This book is about a Couple trying to find one of Hitler's most dangerous agents , Code name ""N"" or ""M"", during the war before Germany mounts a surprise attack on England. The book gets more intense when the daughter of this couple is blown, and their true identity gets revealed to code name ""N or M"""
3,"This book, in the Kindle format, is one of the later books in the Tommy and Tuppence series. Agatha Christie does not break up the original grouping of characters, so even Arthur is brought back to play a pivotal role for all that it was not the highlight of the book. Her presentation of the characters at the boarding house where the book takes place does keep you guessing as to who the N or M characters are, in addition to the wandering female and the subset of other male characters that add to the plot. It was a good basic mystery that didn't take too much time to read and ended well, as they always do."
3,"I first heard the 'Slates' EP when it came out and was totally bothered and befuddled by it. I remembered thinking the cover looked fantastic. I listened to a borrowed vinyl copy many times and never could decide if I liked it, or if I even got it. Years later I got another copy, with all these bonus tracks. I'm still not sure I get it but it sounds great to me. Cleans indie rock garbage out of your ears. Some of their poppiest stuff and also some of the most abrasive."
3,"the music of The Fall is both engaging and off-putting...equal parts clever and brilliant mixed with the confounding and annoying. the casual fan of punk or post rock will probably be confused. and that my friends, may be the point. or maybe not. you decide. take a listen.Slates is great fun...but i'm wondering why it has been released seperately from the A Part Of America Therein, 1981 album. just to make room for bonus tracks? hmmm..."
3,"This tool worked very well for replacing an exhaust valve on my KLX300R. Due to the range of adjustability, I expect that this valve spring compressor will work on any overhead valve motorcycle engine head. I highly recommend this product."
3,"A great first novel in the Manhattan Mystery series. I really liked this book, the main character (Jane Bauer) is a 20 year NYPD policeperson who is debating on leaving the force. She has been moved from a high profile case to doing Cold Case work. She uncovers a whale of a mystery. Really keeps you turning the pages."
3,"This is a profound study of the ancient christianity of Irenaeus who along with Ignatius was a disciple of Polycarp, who was a disciple of John the disciple of Jesus. It takes you back to real christianity, unlike the pseudo christianity prevelant today."
3,"I never heard garageland before until I heard their one song ""Get Even"" which was a song my friend downloaded and let me listen too. I heard the song once and never heard anything from them again for almost a year. It drove me crazy as I couldnt' find it in any record stores and no one I knew even heard the band before. I saw it on Amazon.com and decided to buy it. I was completely blown away after listening to the album that I listened to it again. It's such a great masterpiece from ""Love Song"" to ""End of the Night."" I am very surprised that hardly anyone has heard this band before. The cd always puts me in a good mood and definitely can change my day once I listen to it. Garageland deserves all the credit in the world for putting together a feel-good album. If you want good music, check this album out and do what the title says: DO WHAT YOU WANT!"
3,"This vase is absolutely beautiful! It was just perfect for my pink and black decor in my bedroom. It's lighter in weight than I thought it would be given its size. The black enamel look is beautiful and the cloisone decoration is really pretty. The picture does not do this vase justice. To get the best effect, position the vase as shown; that way, you get the full impact of the flower design. The seller packaged the vase extremely well so that there was no chance for damage and quickly shipped the vase. I am very pleased with the product and the seller."
3,"I thought this movie was a hoot from the start. The opening martial arts scenes look real and professional, but then it goes straight into classic blaxploitation and revenge movie mode: the script is corny and terrible, camera work is strange, the actors sometimes look like they are having trouble keeping a straight face, the violence is cartoonish (except for Kelly's & his opponent's work--he can't help being a pro martial artist), some of looks like it was shot in somebody's back yard and more than I want to write right now. It's not ""Coffy"", my favorite of this genre, but if you like this kind of movie, it's definitely worth watching."
3,"This Louis L'Amour novel is another variation of the familiar plot of land ownership vs. squatters but with a different twist. A ruthless speculator wants to wrest control of an area where a great cache of Spanish gold may be hidden and hires an outfit of hard cases to get rid of the settlers and their town of Yellow Butte. The story is similar to L'Amour's ""The Tall Stranger"", with the same elements of a super cowboy, murdering gunslingers and romance in place. A mysterious grulla, a mouse-colored pony, seems to be the key to the puzzle and points the hero straight to the source of all the mayhem and murder. A nice story in the L'Amour tradition of justice and fair play."
3,"Mr. Ardo is a master QiGong teacher, and his DVD reflects this! He possesses an unusual grasp for taking the sometimes arcane eastern medical and wellness regimens, which have worked for them for thousands of years, and effectively relating them to the western context. Our son recently took a medical QiGong course from Mr. Ardo and received a tremendous amoutn of very positive input that has helped him greatly."
3,It was a good mystery- especially if you like stories from the early 1900's era. Don't think it was as good as some of her others but nevertheless it will hold your interest. Read it for yourself.
3,I HATE READING BUT I SAW AN ARTICLE IN MY BOATING MAGIZINE ABOUT THIS BOOK SO I HAD TO GET. I READ THE WHOLE THING IN 2 DAYS. THIS IS FULL OF INFO THE NEWS STATIONS NEVER TOLD YOU ON THIS DAY WE WILL NEVER FORGET. THIS IS A MUST FOR ANYONE. NEVER FORGET 9/11
3,"I happened to watch a re-run of Shell's Wonderful World of Golf this morning featuring a match at a country club in Belgium during the 1950's. Former King Leopold was among the thirty well-dressed people observing the play, and most of the men could have walked up Park Avenue this year and been in style.More useful than Flusser's later book, Clothes and the Man reminds us that, ignoring the excesses of the 1970's and the general absence of style in Silicon Valley in the 90's, the well dressed man evolves slowly. We may wear driving moccasins and eschew opera pumps in the new century, but the well turned out 1920's man is recognizeable today. That's important because it's the long lives of Anderson & Sheppard suits and Cleverly shoes that makes them attainable by people of less than extraordinary means. And, at least for me, the pleasure of proper fit and great fabrics is the reason to pay attention."
3,"I orfered these to work on a game board lazy susan. Unfortunatels, they were too tall to allow turning without binding. I'll find anoter project where they can be utilized. Good quality. If I need more, I know where to get them. Thank you."
3,"Got this as a stocking stuffer for my husband - it was much too big to fit in a stocking, I was delighted with the size! It's also excellent quality. My two-year-old adores it and insists on sleeping with the 'cweepy cuh-fweh-du.'"
3,"I picked this book up at a garage sale, didn't really know what to expect. The author's story has helped me in my undertaking to be my Dad's caretaker. It shows how we all deal differently with this challenge in our lives. I didn't agree with some of the ways the author handled things, but it validates that we all have to find our own way. This book is a quick read, it's worth the time."
3,"I purchased this to replace the old ones I had. They are better quality and stick a whole lot better. It's a little pricey but you get what you pay for. Excellent buy, I will return when I need to."
3,"Yeah, it's contain import racing cars but not like the 1st part, the 1st part was all about racing movie, the 2nd part contains some races and more action scenes.In the end you got to watch it..."
3,"I HAVE TO SAY THAT THIS IS IS AN EXCELLENT, FAST PACED, WILD AND CRAZY JOY RIDE MOVIE....MY 3 YR OLD SON ACTS OUT THE MOVIE....TALK ABOUT CUTE....I GIVE THIS 2 THUMBS UP FOR SURE...."
3,"Let me start out by saying how much fun this movie was!! The action was awesome the acting was average and the directing was good. Some people complain that the some of the car chases amd races are digital effects, that my be, but it makes the car chases really cool, because they do things that you can't do in real life. This is pure brainless fun! My dad even enjoyed it! Leave your brain at home and have a great time! Trust me!"
3,"This movie has a strange appeal.It not only brings out your atavistic side but it also shows a simple and very often touching comradery not only between the two main characters but also the entire group of the good ""bad"" guys.The plot is simple and mindless but it is a great ride, particularly on a 57"" HD TV."
3,"Very gripping story, I didn't want to put it down. Claire is a little wordy at times and I found myself skipping paragraphs, but overall I loved it. Really makes you feel for the authors and understand their pain from each side."
3,"This is the most profound book I have read in 2007. I think about it often and my book group seems to revisit it every month even though we read it 6 months ago. This is a raw story of healing and torment, not self indulgent or too self absorbed like many other acclaimed memoirs. I loved it and could not put it down"
3,"This book deals honestly with the question, ""What do I believe when God doesn't respond the way I thought He would?""It's the story of two best friends, one of whom gets cancer. When everyone in the two friends lives pray, asking for healing, and God doesn't heal--what then?The women's frienship and their relationships with their children, and others is very inspiring.This book has an emotional intensity that is very compelling. It is also quite refreshing to read of someone grappling HONESTLY with tough questions."
3,"I love the series, and the videos are great. The quality is excellent. However, English is not my first language and the lack of Spanish (and any other language) subtitles was a sort of disappointment. I didn't know that before the purchase. Fortunatly, the audio is great. And if you don't mind the absence of subtitles, I totally recommend it!"
3,I am so excited to read this book. It is a classic yet completely illustrates what can happen in the near future. Anyone who loves dystopian fiction owes to him or herself to read this and read it more than once.
3,"I join the other reviewers of This Perfect Day who plead that it be brought back in print. I just re-read it. It is, on this second reading, as suspensful and as insightful as I remembered from when I first read it in 1978. Chip's struggle to rescue his humanity from the noxious grip of the state is inspiring (and quite entertaining!).This Perfect Day should be made into a movie."
3,"If you're looking for a potted history of marketing or an essay about how the Internet is coming of age, please don't think you'll get the answers in this book. However, if you're in business now or thinking of starting up perhaps you should read this. Don't expect a ten-point plan on how to gain market superiority via the Internet or instructions on how to put your customers in a loyalty box they won't be able to escape from, but it may just help if you want to still *be* in business in the next few years.As a senior manager of IT & statistical services in the public sector for over ten years I find that Locke et al make me ashamed for all the times I didn't tell suppliers that I would no longer accept their crap. I hope some of those suppliers are reading this book and taking heed because I'm sharing my copy with my colleagues and together we represent a not-too-shabby purchasing power...I hope the message is clear; get a clue!"
3,"I bought these hoping they would provide me with sturdy HIGH arch support and they are the only insoles I have bought (and I have tried many) that do just that. I have sore arches and need high support. They provide this and a cushiony insole too. Plus the plastic is moldable to make a higher arch if I needed such. Excellent product, high quality."
3,"My husband received a recommendation from his podiatrist to try the Spenco inserts. He purchased a pair of the full size inserts and they were great in his golf shoes. When he checked Amazon, he liked the idea of a 3/4 insert because that gave him more room in the toe box as well as the support for his feet. Now he has a pair for dress shoes and casual shoes as well as those very important golf shoes. This product is excellent for diabetics who really need to take special care of their feet."
3,"When I first saw the front picture of the DVD I thought ""Drama and hedgehog-haired McAvoy in sunglasses?""Luckily I did watch it, and had my front-picture-opinion turned 180 degrees opposite. Loved it, and put in the row of my ""Golden Collection"".Wouldn't notice the 104 minutes past.Astonished by the Rory's struggle to live as if it is his last day, tough enough to keep his interior Rory well hidden, yet open enough to convince the audience about his ongoing drama, completely excluding the pity.Yet another proof of simple things being genius.Highly recommend."
3,"We unfortunately, have not yet had snow, but this was, by far, the best Christmas present my 2 year old received this year. She managed to convince everyone around her to pull her around the house the entire day, and continues to do it every time she gets her hands on it. And when we're not pushing her, she puts her dolls and Elmos in it and pushes them.There are ocassional presents that you feel good about making the investment in terms of getting your money's worth. This was definitely one of those.Also, in terms of delivery. I ordered it the Wednesday before Christmas, and it was in my driveway by Friday."
3,"Like the other reviewers said, the cord is too short, so expect to replace it as soon as you get it.The sled was great fun last winter, and I'm sure it will be just as fun this winter. My only minor complaint is that it isn't very wide in the bottom, and with a kid in it, it becomes fairly top-heavy. Half the time you are letting the passenger slide down a hill, it will topple over to one side, especially if your kids moves around a little.Other than that, great fun at a great price."
3,"i could not put this book down! And after reading it, i had to get the sequel (Dance Dance Dance) right away. this is a detective novel of the psyche that is surreal, wild and superbly absurd!"
3,"For those who don't know, this is the third book of his chronology: (1) Listen to the Wind Song; (2) 1973's Pinball; (3) A Wild Sheep Chase. Of course, after that, you have Dance, Dance, Dance. A story about ""I"", ""Mouse"" and ""Sheep Man"" - with the grand finale in ""A Wild Sheep Chase."" So, if you like this one, read Murakami's first novel, Listen to the Wind Song and proceed. Finish off with Dance Dance Dance in the Dolphin Hotel of Sapporo. Enjoy."
3,"This book is excellent and forms a very important part of my architectural, research library!"
3,These are the exact same thing to buy from the dealer at half the cost.
3,"WELL,JOE SAMPLE HAS DONE IT AGAIN WITH HIS OWN VERSATILE STYLE THAT MAKES YOU BEG FOR MORE AND HE DELIVERS AS USUAL. THERE'S NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT THAT MR. SAMPLE STILL HAS THE RIGHT STUFF."
3,"Hi Joe,Thanks to invite us on your Pecan Tree!From this point of view the world seems a little bit better.Marvellous musicians, Lizz is a brand new gem and the sound so soft and hypnotic.This is a must for all the people who love the feelings in music!"
3,WORKS WELL. NO MALFUNCTIONS SO FAR. USED IT SEVERAL TIMES. I USE TWO DECKS IN THE CARD GAMES I PLAY.
3,Works great as long as the cards aren't to old. I would recommend it. Use it several times a week.
3,"Why? Caddyshack 1, although emmesly hilaruios, didn't hold much of a storyline. They just jumped right in! If Danny died I wouldn't have cared. But here's the thing. It grows on you. You start noticing things.In Caddyshack 2 Jackie Mason was a improved Rodney Dangerfeild."
3,I ordered this book for my friend in Japan who is learning Henna body painting.She will make most of it as a smple design book.
3,"Includes Beatle clock, Beatle sweater, Beatle key chain & CD all in a nice red box. This is a well-packaged product and quite rare."
3,"This review concerns the original 1931 edition. At the stroke of midnight, Joe is kidnapped from a party at the Morton farm and Frank and his chums set out, not only to find Joe, but to discover why he was kidnapped. I'd more accurately give the book a rating of 3.5 stars. The writing, like with all previous volumes, is excellent and the mystery is alright, but the book doesn't quite live up to the intriguing title. Mr. Hardy does not make an appearance in the book as he is said to be on a case out West and, in my opinion, his omission only hurts the story. Most readers would probably not rate this book as one of their favorites in the set, but they probably wouldn't rate it as one of their least favorites either."
3,"Well, I specifically bought this for Hikaru Utada's ""Passion"", although I would have liked the English version, but I like Jpop so it's just as good.In fact, it really grew on me.Yeah, the rest of the music is ripped right from the game and it's good too.So, there you have it."
3,Liked this film a lot. Brando is a great director. Too bad he diodn't do more like this. Will buy more like this.
3,"Alien Ant Farm got stereotyped as the band that re-made ""Smooth Criminal"". Their sophomore effort, truANT, blows any stereotypes, as well as comparisons to the king of pop, and their first album out of the water and proves they have much melodic integrity. These songs are much better versed as far as funky, tasty, edgy, melodic pop rockin' music is concerned. Very original vocal melodies and harmonies combined with a variety of well-constructed guitar licks and drum work stand out and make this a great album. At about 51 seconds into the third track ""Quiet"", there is one of the best drum fills I've ever heard. Track 8, ""Goodbye"", has one of the most addictive choruses of all time. truANT, truTHAT!"
3,"The first ANTHRAX album is a far cry from their last. FISTFUL OF METAL is the only 'THRAX album to feature NEIL TURBIN on vocals. Although many don't remember this guy, and credit JOEY BELLADONNA for the original sound of the band, he was a NASTY vocalist. This is one of my faves of the THRAX backlog because of the insanely high pitched vocals delivered over revolutionary thrash riffs from way back in 1983. Definately a unique sounding record. It should be hailed by rockers and metal heads alike. Yet this album is way under appreciated.The songs are nothing short of in your face and kickin' ACE! I personally would take this over Metallicas debut from the same year. Anthrax are way more raw and rigid, with nasty F you up licks. Yeah, the album sounds like it was recorded inside of a tin can, but that only adds to its charm.TEAR IT UP! LOUDER BABY LOUDER!"
3,"This book has been so valuable to me. I have had some shoulder, back, and arm problems due to my occupation and repetitive motions, and since I use these stretches every morning, I am no longer in pain. It is very easy to locate the stretches you need for any of the muscle groups, and it is written in a concise manner with great illustrations and just enough explanation. Highly recommended!"
3,The book is just what it says it is. It is a self explain book and it couldn't be any better than this.
3,"i have to say that this was the best spoof movie i have ever seen, blows scary movie out of the water. i do have to say that some scenes were played out overall the movie made me laugh till i cried and ...my pants. but one warning dont go into this movie and expect a high budget movie. great movie i am going to see it again. jsut one thing for those who have seen it. ..."
3,"Kung Pow is a kind of a movie that is not intended to stimulate the intellectual side of its viewers. It relies sometimes on over-the-top silly kid jokes. Nevertheless, I found myself enjoying it. I think that the reason I did was because I have seen many fighting flicks in the past, and seing a movie that made fun of them was very novel. After all, this comedy makes fun of practically every single stereotypical feature of an average kung fu movie. If you were or still are a fan of kung fu movies you might find Kung Pow rather entertaining. If you are not, then be aware of possible disappointment."
3,"O.K. i'll be the first one to say that . Kung Pow, looked pretty stupid. In fact I didn't even want to go see it, but my friends did. i went to see it with my friends, and I loved it! It was one of the funniest movies i had ever seen. I waited, and waited for it to come out on dvd, and months later it finally did. I now own it, and the dvd features are really good. if you had doubts about seeing this movie, put them a side and see it. You Will Most Likely Love It! I KNOW I DID, ONCE I GAVE IT A CHANCE! SEE IT!"
3,"I love this movie. Okay. I admit it. Seeing all the other people on Amazon who liked it too gives me the strength to say that. But why I like it is a trickier question.It's not uproariously funny. There are many gags that just lay there and die. But then, there are the brilliant bits, little pieces of comedy gold. Though it's tempting to be harsh on this film, I have to admit every time I watch it I laugh. And isn't that its purpose? And in that respect, it succeeds admirably, because I still laugh and I still look forward to watching it.If you like ""AIRPLANE"" style humor, then this is definitely worth seeing. It really helps to view it with someone who has the right sense of humor. When my girlfriend and I watch this, we both laugh even more.It's truly original, and just plain funny."
3,"With this volume, Zegapain finds some direction. With Kyo now given a strong sense of purpose, the story is starting to come together... albeit a little late. While the series is certain have lost at least a small percentage of its audience with the first two volumes, it will be interesting to see where the staff takes the series from here. With the enemy armed with a new weapon and the heroes on the defensive, what used to be a terribly below average mech series just redeemed itself just enough to get me excited about the second half."
3,"This is the anime that started it all for me; I remember staying up late watching the old school Adult Swim just to see it. This is by far the best anime in my opinion; it has something for everyone and is still interesting no matter how many times I watch it. Don't even think about it, just buy this anime, you will love it!"
3,Chris Kubasik really did a wonderful job with this one. I own nearly every Battletech novel and gaming system and this novel has really stood out. The realism in the 'horrors of war' concepts truely stand out as well as the feelings of the main character Paul Masters as he see's that it is not an 'ideal war'. One last thing his Phoenix Hawk is the best described mech in any of the books i have read.
3,"I've read all the Dennis Lehane books now, including the new one (Gone, Baby, Gone), and they all range from good to great. But this is the one I keep coming back to. It's gripping, it's frightening, it's amazingly realistic, esp. the dialogue. OK, the Bubba Rogowski character is a little over the top, but certainly no more than some of the characters in Robert B. Parkers ""Spenser"" novels. The main and supporting cxast are terrific, and the plot is dark and wonderfully convoluted. The killer(s) are edgy, brilliant maniacs who really deliver a punch. If you're looking for a good, solid thriller that'll make you squirm a little, this is the place to start. And once you start, you won't stop until you've read the entire Lehane collection. I can't wait for the next one."
3,"I read this book quickly, unable to put it down. I was caught up in the story and totally invested in the lives of the well-drawn characters. I really liked this book, it's another that I could do with a 4.5* rating for!"
3,"Seems to be a great muffler, which is why I'm buying a pair. BUT it has 3 chambers, not 2."
3,"Hip-O Records presents a great cast of soul artists with heart - Patti LaBelle, Marvin Gaye, Barry White, Smokey Robinson & the Miracles, Lenny Williams, Lionel Ritchie, Con Funk Shun, The Dynamic Superiors, The Originals, L.T.D., Atlantic Starr and Rufus featuring Chaka Khan.Of course there are highlights - ""IF YOU ASKED ME TO"" (1989)...""I'VE GOT SO MUCH TO GIVE"" (1973)...""OOH BABY BABY"" (1965)...""IF I SHOULD DIE TONIGHT"" (1973), each tune and individual original.Hats off to Pat Lawrence (producer) and Hip-O on their current release, entire CD is outstanding...so pick this one up and cuddle next to your favorite girl, give them both your undivided attention...need to add this one to your ""love collection""!Total Time: 52:19 on 12 Tracks...Hip-O Records...(2000)"
3,"WOW,While I had high hopes for this CD I didn't expect to love it as much as I do.I'm not usually a big fan of double albums as its usually a lot of music to process but in the case of ""Back To Basics"" it is well worth it.Christina has never sounded better and the music is ""today"" with an old school flavor.Disk one starts out rockin with ""Makes me wanna Pray"" ""Back in the day"",""oh Mother"",Slow down baby""""Still Dirrty"" are all highlights.There are lots of possible singles here,my faves are ""Ain't no other man"",""CandyMan""""Here to Stay"" ""Slow down baby"" and the ""Right Man"".The Linda Perry ballads on disk two are very good,""Have Mercy on Me"" has a Fiona Apple vibe, ""Hurt""will probably be a huge hit a la ""Beautiful"",'The Right Man "" is very moving.""I Got Trouble"" and ""Nasty Naughty Boy""are fun throwbacks to the 30s and 40s.This album is a fully realized vision from CXhristina Aguilera,we'll see her at Grammy time."
3,This girl has some serious vocal chords--she's the definition of a real singer. The whole album is great. Best 16 bucks ever spent on a CD.
3,I absolutely LOVE this CD and Christina Aguilera. She was gone for so long that I almost forgot how incredible her voice is. She puts her own spin on each and every song. She has definitely stepped her game up and puts herself in a category that few can obtain--greatness. This is a must CD!
3,"It's great when an authour arrives before the fact. This novel problematizes Western involvement with Indochina affairs, more specific American military involvement in Vietnam. This problem was to be a key issue for left wing people more than a decade later from when Greene wrote his book. In that respect ""The Quiet American"" is similar to Hanif Kureishis ""The Black Album"" which problematizes British Muslim radicalization in 1995, a decade before the 7 July 2005 London bombings. As said in the start, it's great when an authour arrives before the fact, because after the fact it's crowded with all the idiots!"
3,This product is great for beginning learners. As a teacher of Arabic I truly recomend this book. It is a little expensive but it is worth it (I still use it).
3,"This is a hauntingly beautiful, yet dark, rock album with lots of textures. It takes a few listens to get into, but it's a very rewarding experience. Modern progressive rock continues to impress and White Willow have always been worth a listen, The range of music on this album is really good. 'Soulburn' is reminiscent of Pain of Salvation, whereas 'Nightside of Eden' reminds me a bit of Arena. This is only my opinion of course! Crank up the volume and make up your own minds - I love the keyboards on this album!"
3,"""The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever"" lacked the sparkle and wit that Julia Quinn creates in her books. The chemistry between Miranda and Turner never sparked or crackled, it was always at a mellow hum. The passion seemed to be on the side of lacking, there was anger, but not the passion typical of the genre. The book had its pleasing moments. I found the last 75 pages or so very compelling, the only part of the book that I could not put down, but I felt like I had to drudge through a lot to get there. Quinn was very redundant in her writing, restating and restating things, I wondered if she had forgotten that she had already written similar statements and feelings."
3,"Dear Hellacious,If I didn't know any better i'd think you were a (young) girl as well given your music tastes... dashboard confessional is not punk, just for reference. It's clearly emotinal music. so before you go bashing Emo, you should recognize that you're obviously a Fan. hypocrite central. Anyways this album is spectacular.The best song by far is If I told you this was killing me, would you stop?. Beauty in a nutshell. Buy it!!!!"
3,"it was the right replacment, it was easy to fit and it workes just fin i'm very happy with it"
3,"My science background consists of high school chemistry, biology and physics and one college course in physics. K. C. Cole's ability to make the difficult understable for someone like myself is most admirable. The ""Hole in the Universe"" and the whole concept of ""nothing"" opened up a whole new world for me and other members of our book club, none of whom had ever before read much non-fiction, much less on physics and cosmology. I recommend it to ""science interested"", but science illiterates like myself."
3,"What can I say? This is the album that made me fall hard for a long-haired artist from England that took over the radio and TV talk shows of my youth. (The 70's) From the moment DeeDee and I put it on the stereo we were hooked! We screamed whenever he so much as shook his hair backward or sang in that sexy voice as only he could. When he sang ""Do you feel Like we do"" and did his little bob that he used to do (which he still does,I'm happy to report) we were mesmerized! There will always be a special place in my musical heart for Peter and I am so happy that he is once again touring and putting his input into different projects and upcoming movies. Way to go,Peter!"
3,I loved Frampton in the 70's and love him now. He gets better with age. Hopo he sells more albums. Just the greatest.
3,If you were a teenager in the late 70's this record was issued to you.It permeated that entire era. A must have. Bought it on cd a while ago and really enjoyed listening to all of it again. Frampton was really at the top of his game here. Memories.
3,"The novel is finely written. The reader would do well to read the first five in the series, as this calls more than most on things from the past. Trollope delights in bringing and tying together most of the major characters of his series in a satisfying stew. Septamus Harding is especially well drawn and unifies the entire series. The reader learns much more of Josiah Crawley, whose travails form the spine of the plot. All in all the reader is treated to a portrayal of Victorian society that strikes me as entirely believable."
3,"played it from jersey city, nj to miami beach, fl and beyond. cooling out beach sounds and memory making music for me an my girls on our summer road trip. omar's voice is smooth and sensual. all the tracks are uplifting yet melancholy. a favorite!!"
3,I really did not have any idea what I was getting into when I opened my Kindle to this story. What I found was an inspirational story that leads one to reevaluate their life and that of what is most important to them.This is a very fast read and at only 146 pages it is also very short leading the reader longing for more. Lewis uses his infamous fable abilities to transform our vision of Heaven and Hell by a simple bus ride and visitors from our past. For better or for worse we have to accept the Gift that has been given to us and we have to do this on His terms not ours.
3,"The third in Jay Craven's series of film adaptations of Howard Frank Mosher novels (the others are 'High Water' (1991), 'Where the Rivers Flow North' (1993), and the upcoming 'Disappearances'.) By far Craven's darkest film to date, telling a story of murder and racism in a small, backwards Vermont town, c. 1950. A nice piece of cinema which is at once both a compelling drama and a well executed whodunit, featuring top-drawer performances (particularly Rusty DeWees, Bill Raymond, and Ernie Hudson.), and an appropriately eerie score by the Horse Flies. Not entirely faithful to the book, but how many films are? Worth at least a rental from anybody who likes a good drama."
3,"For such an age-old festival, only the purest of documentary art will do it justice. Commentary would spoil the images, and Nadeem Uddin instead provides us a mix of music and sounds that strengthen the already powerful and beautiful images he recorded of millions of devout Hindus on their way to salvation.This is Direct Cinema at its best, empowering viewers to make their own judgments, or just to enjoy a montage of filmic images that defines a unique congregation and community of mankind.Would that we could all share such an experience. Now we can."
3,This book has helpful recipes using easily acquired ingredients for anyone watching their sugar intake. Delightful to the eye as well as to the palate.
3,"I read a lot of romance and romantic suspense and quite frankly, I'm getting a bit bored. So not long ago, I picked up my old copy of ""Flirting with Danger"" to re-read and I wasn't disappointed. I love this book! There's a strong hero AND strong heroine, an old-movie type caper (""To Catch a Thief""), suspense, romance, and best of all the beginnings of an interesting character journey for the two leads. I wish more authors wrote books like this one!"
3,"As a psychotherapist that specializes in treating men with a history of sexual abuse and having been an incest victim my self, I have read a great deal of the literature and books on the subject. This is one of the best at really conveying the pain and impact upon a developing mind and body. A fast but powerful read that anyone who really wants to understand or to see that he was not the only one. I will recommend it highly in all of my workshops on abuse and to my clients that are ready to face their pain. I am grateful that Walter shared his pain and most of all his healing. It will help many."
3,"Jackie is the man this is a great one, also get police story new police story and super cop all great movies"
3,It is a very well documented book showing the Canadian senator and his world and times. I found it interesting that Canada is such a different country from the United States. I found myself with a great admiration for our neighbor country after reading the book.
3,"In Diane Bishes video she opened the world of Organ music to me. My favorite peices are: Sleepers, Wake;Arioso from Cantata 156;Sinfonia from Cantata No.29,Prelude and Fugue in d Major; and Virgil Fox's arrangement for Now Thank We All Our God. I also enjoy watching the Joy of Music as often as I can. My goal in life is to become a great organist. My name is Daniel Ponder and I am 12 yrs. old."
3,"I've purchased the smaller square dishes and loved them, so I thought I'd get the larger rectangle one. Very nice indeed, but it was smaller than I had in mind. The measurements are correct in the description, but in my head I was picturing it larger. LOL I love using these for apple tarts."
3,"Feels well made, enough. I've worn it a few times for some play and there are no tears, even after throwing it in the washing machine. I would say that it might be too small for somebody tall. I'm 5'1ish, thin/petite and I had a hard time fitting into this properly.Pros: Looks hot, feels sexy, easy off, crotchlessCons: A bit small (for a small person), and a bit hard to get on...also it can get a bit itchy, even though the material is super soft (the fishnet pattern can hurt your knees...you know, if you're on all fours.)"
3,"I've always been a Simple Plan fan, I actually got their 1st CD, No Pads, No Helmets, Just Balls, the day it came out and I loved it. When I got this CD I totally fell in love all over again! These guys are absolutly amazing!"
3,"This Cd is very good, if you are having problems with life this is for you. I love it!"
3,"I loved this cd so much. simple plan has grown up so much. I mean I'm in my teens and i can relate to most of their songs and my cousin is 24 and she can also to. I love the song ""ONE"" they have 11 amazing songs on this cd but this one actually made me cry!!"
3,"I have been a Simple Plan fan for a long time now, I absolutly love No Pads, No Helmets, just Balls. I was very excited for there new cd to come out. It seems like I waited forever. I got Still Not Getting Any the day it came out and it was well worth the wait. The lyrics are touching, and you can tell they have matured more as a band. This is just an awesome cd that I highly reccomend everyone buy."
3,"Hey everyone! Finally the long awaited follow up to No Pads... SNGA is here. It's a job well done by the bois and it shows just how far they have come since No Pads. They have grown up so much. Especially little Pierre... anyway. With pure punk beats from songs such as ""Shut Up,"" ""Thank You,"" ""Me Against The World,"" and my personal fave ""Jump,"" and more softer sounding ballads ""Perfect World,"" ""Crazy"" and ""Untitled"" this album is sure to deliver for any hardcore Simple Plan fans out there and the not so hard core ones too!!! Pure Gold!!!!Shazza"
3,"Rather than continue on with the happy, spunky songs that are found on the first CD ""No Pads, No Helmet...Just Balls,"" Simple Plan has taken the opportunity to show that they can write lyrics that are meaningful (not that the first ones weren't) and mix them with great instrumentation. The new CD ""Still Not Getting Any..."" contains many great songs, most of which say things that matter and might possibly make a difference to a lot of people. This CD is a perfect example of- in this case- musicians that prove they can grow and change their direction somewhat but never actually change themselves or their overall style. I recommend this CD to anyone who wants to be known for having good taste in music."
3,"If you are sick and tired of the dogmatic(mostly uninformed) KJO crowd telling you things like ""if it ain't King James, it ain't bible"" and touting that ""all the other translations are of the devil"", and that James White is ""a rude, crude heretic and a ""serial soul-killer"", (yaddy yaddy yaa) ,then THIS IS THE READ FOR YOU! I promise you this text will more than explain why so many jump on the KJO bandwagon and why so many have NEVER GOTTEN OFF OF IT. I also recommend that you visit Mr. White's website(http://aomin.org/kjvo.html) and see how dogmatic many of these people are and how downright slanderous they can be to other believers. Pay special attention to ""James White's refutation of Gail Riplinger's book, New Age Bible Versions! You'll clearly see from the refutation how so many KJO believers are just simply uninformed. I leave you with a quote from ""one of them"": ""If it was good enough for Paul, it's good enough for me."""
3,"This book is an amazing tool, along with the bible, for all christians to obtain and read as it is a good example of the life that God wishes us to live, it has assisted me personally to improve my relationship with my God as I surrender to Him daily. The author is Andrew Murray.Absolute Surrender (Optimized for Kindle)"
3,"A typical Louis L'Amour tale with lots of real world locations and exciting action. My only disappointment was the occasional typo in the Kindle version, but I can overlook that for the most part. A great story in the Sackett line."
3,"An excellent look at the positives and (many) negatives associated with an elitist dictatorial society. Ironically, while many argue that Plato was calling for just such a utopia, a strong argument can be made that Plato was in fact pointing out the weakenesses with just such a creation. Plato's allegory of the cave is, perhaps, the most eye opening part of the text."
3,"I lived in Slovakia for two years, during which I had to pick up the language mostly by myself. When I discovered this book partway into the second year I was delighted. It is excellent for any English speaker, easy to understand and very to follow. The only drawback is for missionaries and diplomats - those who are MOVING to the country. By the time you get to the chapters on grocery shopping and going to the post office you might have died of starvation! Skip to these right away and don't be afraid to take the book with you into stores. Have a good time!"
3,"Okay, this isn't a standard use, but I bought these to use as water and food dishes for my pet mice. They like dishes better than bottles, and these won't tip over. They're the perfect size, and cheaper than bowls marketed specifically for pets."
3,"The war's not over-at least in this english country estate when their son brings home a very, very american wife!Superb cast of characters."
3,"David Davidson is a violinist who has put together an enjoyable collection of music that is hard to classify; not quite classical, not quite New Age, not quite folk, not quite jazz, and not quite Celtic. As the title indicates, it is a Celtic fantasy, not a re-creation of Celtic music, that Davidson has set out to produce. With strings and keyboards and synths, his violin being the chief solo voice, he has produced what seems to be a soundtrack in search of a film, which makes this music not quite movie music, either. But it is quite enjoyable. Profound, no; enjoyable, very."
3,"I'm an Etymotic Research earphones fan who try to find a budget (less than 50 dollars) & rather tough earphones for outdoor activities (yet, still sounds decent).For below 40 bucks, this is one of the best earphones I've ever had.They work well even with supplied ear tips... just a bit better with comply foam.Since I was too lazy to order them separately, I grabbed both the earphones and comply foam at the same time. Which I could have saved 15 bucks without the foam.Just can't believe how someone could rate this product below 3 stars...I know these earphones don't sound so sophisticated or either well-gripped & tight bass.However, it's 35 dollars!!!What are they expecting for such money? A perfect couple?Come on..."
3,"I have recently purchased the Altec Lansing inEar headphones to replace my beloved pair of Ultimate Ears SuperFi 5 headphones. I loved my UE headphones and used them for everything. However they only lasted for a year before the earbud separated from the wire. I particularly liked the wrap around the ear cord that kept the earbuds in my ears when I was running. They were almost identical to the Altec Lansings that I recently purchased but they seem to have corrected the earbud separation from the wire issue that I had (I hope). Both sound very good to my untrained ear. I have flown extensively with the UE which do a fairly good job at blocking out the screaming baby that always sits next to me. I read several reviews that discuss the lack of bass. I was pleased with the amount of bass but do not listen to heavy bass music. Overall, I can't tell much of a difference other than the cost (I think I purchased the UE on Amazon for $168). SAME HEADPHONES! Enjoy."
3,"Altec Lansing UHP 336 headphones are the best price with the best quality, fits my need for work.I recommend it."
3,"Nearly every review that has been written of this book emphasizes the breadth of the story - ""Biblical,"" they say. It's all true. If you love stories and in depth characters and riding by the seat of your trousers, this THE book for you.Read this book. You'll never feel down on your luck again."
3,"Egolf's first novel grabbed me and didn't let go. From the opening 220 word sentence to its poignant end, Tristan Egolf is put into the company of Pynchon and Stephenson (Cryptonomicon). Although not as muddled as Pynchon or inanely absurd as Stephenson, Egolf's novel is outrageous enough to make the comparison. He creates vivid (not vapid) characters, outlandish situations and wonderful, articulate prose. I'm looking forward to reading his next novel."
3,"Tristan Egolf was an insightful, at times brilliant writer, with a true gift for wordplay and a wry, sardonic sense of humor. Upon learning of his apparent suicide this past Mother's Day, I felt compelled to add my kudos here in the hope that new readers may have an opportunity to experience his unique voice."
3,"I used these on my Ridgid JP0610 Jointer and they are at least as good as the blades that came with the unit. They already have little nicks in them, which is about what the stock blades did too. For the price they are very reasonable. If you want basically the same blades that came with your Ridgid, these work fine. They are not an upgrade, but may very well be the most cost effective solution. I bought a couple sets to make sure I don't run out again. As always they were shipped promptly and arrived on time and un damaged."
3,"I am what you would call a ""switcher"" having used Windows PCs for about two decades already. This is my first Mac, BTW. After a 2-3 day adjustment period, I now appreciate the Mac OS and the other cool features of the MacBook.Why the 4-stars? Well, I don't like the color white. And neither could I type well on ""chicklet"" keyboards.Hey Steve, offer the color gray and the recessed keys (like those on the MacBook Pro) and I would give this item 5 stars."
3,"My daughters had both saved money for about a year for a computer. I had to decide to go the Windows path or to go with Apple. (We use both in our office and as the owner of the company I'm the default IT guy.)We could have bought equivalent processing speed and features about 20% cheaper with Windows, but I would be the one who had to maintain the things so we went with these MacBooks.One of the best decisions I've made this year.They worked great out of the box for what the girls wanted to do. My wife used one and now doesn't want to touch my Dell laptop. She was shocked when she saw how easy it was to save a document as a PDF file or setup a new printer.We downloaded NeoOffice and that works well.Only challenge was setting up the wireless network. Nowhere in our Netgear wireless router documentation does it tell you the PassKey is in Hex. Luckily the Mac shows hexidecimal as an option so once I saw that the job was done.Terrific product for us"
3,"This is the best Nilsson collection, becaause it is the only collection of Nilsson with the song ""Girlfriend"", a tune that became a theme song for The Courtship of Eddie's Father."
3,"I just so love this book. It gets straight to the point, It is incredibly detailed plus for beginners like myself who are new to collage it makes perfect sense."
3,"A wonderful book, that is so enchanting. (you can't help but fall in love with it). I loved this book from the start. A half-breed (indian) gun-slinger who has a soft spot in his heart for a daughter of saloon woman. She is a sweet innocent girl, he is anything but innocent. With her sweetness she finds the good in him and brings it out. This is a very adventurous tale with a lot of action and twists and turns. Their love has so many trials to face. Will love conquer all? Read one of the best books I've ever read and find out!"
3,"This is one of River's most emotional roles while he was alive, and he is great in the film! Keanu is also great in the film! River and Keanu have also worked together in other movies, such as ""I Love you to Death"" which you are able to buy at Amazon.com I have seen nearly all of River's film's and if you are a fan of his work then you need to see this film! WATCH IT!"
3,"River Phoenix was the best actor of his generation, even though he had barely gotten started on what should have been an astounding career. Perhaps he was too good; he was scary.I saw this picture and cried for days. Even now, years later, I hesitate to see it again. Too real; too sad. The condition and fate of the homeless orphan is overwhelming. The cruelty of the world to the weakest among us cannot be forgotten."
3,"completely meet up my expectation,love it so much&really miss River...nice collection of the movie with booklets,background introductions and nice pictures..."
3,"To any and everyone who is sick of generic rock bands, I enthusiastically encourage you to purchase this and everyone of Coldplay's Albums. I started with a ""Rush of Blood to the Head,"" then moved to ""X&Y"" and only recently purchased ""Parachutes."" I can sum up the whole Coldplay experience with one word...Amazing! As a singer song writer myself, I find myself listening to the music and absorbing the lyrics almost in awe. For instance read the lyrics while paying close attention to the vivid imagery in the song ""Spies,"" soak in the melody, and ask yourself one question...who write's like that? Noone. You cannot listen to that song and not visualize your own mental music video."
3,"Again, from beginning to end, this album is a complete gem! My girlfriend at the time told me about this new song Coldplay had just released in Europe; the song was ""The Scientist."" As soon as i heard that song i fell in love with it. Little did i know those lyrics, as well as the lyrics for ""Warning Sign"" would come back to haunt me and torture me endlessly. Anyway, songs like Clocks, In My Place, The Scientist, Warning Signs, Green Eyes and Amsterdam are amazing. Not since U2 has a band so consistantly made great music!! Overall, Coldplay is the best band in the world! Sorry 2U..i love you too guys..but Coldplay gets my money!!!"
3,"Though i usually like punk music, i gave this cd a try. I havent listened to the whole thing yet, but i would buy it anywasy. Thes songs are beautiful, and have some of the best piano work of all time. The songs are clean, pure, catchy, and inspiring. After listening to it, you wonder why Cold play isnt as popular as some other artists. Like a good dream, this cd is a breath of fresh air."
3,"When I heard Parachutes a couple of years ago, I wondered whether this band would have ever produced such a good album. This album is a smacking answer to my question. Not only is this album as good as Parachutes, but its also much better, melodically, lyrically and musically.From the very first track to the last track, this album is flawless. Even after listening for the first time, I realised that this album is a masterpiece. Songs like 'In My Place' and 'The Scientist' are examples of songs that really come straight from the heart, and this is, in my opinion what makes this album so great.Two other songs which stand out on this album are Politik and the title track which are both 5-star songs with such beauty that they just make you want to lay down on your bed with your headphones and forget about the rest of the world.If you invest in this CD, you won't regret it."
3,"Coldplay had a great album in Parachutes. That's why it's so unbelievable that A Rush of Blood to the Head is so much better! This is the only album of a modern band (besides Radiohead) that I can listen all the way through and not feel like they are redoing the same song / style with different lyrics 12 times in a row.During an interview before the release of In My Place, Chris Martin (lead singer) was asked what their new single was going to be, he replied jokingly ""Yellow 2."" Well, thank goodness Yellow 2 this is not. Every song is a masterpiece with its own sound and message.I've waited a long time for this album, and they did not disappoint me at all. The only thing that bothers me is that I'm going to have to wait at least another 2 years before I can get more! Hopefully they will release a live album after this tour!"
3,I have always loved Coldplay's A Rush of Blood to the Head but hearing it in its entirety on vinyl is truly a wonderful experience. If you enjoy this album your experience will be greatly improved on the old school record.
3,"As soon as the stores opened up, I needed to get this CD. I am ashamed to admit, I had the privelege to hear an advance copy of ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"" however, I can't name any names as I am obligated to protect the guilty/innocent.It is no surprise that most bands stick to the stuff that sells. Who can blame them? For Coldplay, its a differnt story. There are some reminiscents of ""Parachutes"" but, this CD is hot! Tracks that I especially like are ""Green Eyes"", ""In my Place"", of course, and ""A Whisper"" are all awesome tracks.This is not to say that the rest of CD isnt good its just plain awesome. A couple of years ago, I have been heard saying ""Music is at its all time low."" Well, things are definitley on the up again, thanks to the resurgence of bands/groups that are producing well written lyrics and using more than two chords on their guitars."
3,"Coldplay was critically acclaimed across the globe with their first major album, Parachutes, released back in 2000. With their hard rock roots combined with touching, soft rock melodies, Parachutes was a modern classic. It was also known for being deleivered by a band that nobody cared about or listened to. Coldplay was one of the most surprising bands in history, and a band that nobody thought would do very well, similar to the sleeper hit band, The White Stripes.On A Rush of Blood to the Head, Coldplay continues upon Parachutes and sticks to the formula that they have been using all along. A Rush of Blood to the Head has already turned out several great sleeper hits, including God Put a Smile Upon Your Face, and the best track that nobody listened to of 2002, Clocks. Since Coldplay stayed firmly rooted along the lines of Parachutes, it is all more the reason to buy this new album. Any fan of soft rock will enjoy it, and the original Coldplay fans will love it as well."
3,"Definitely not as good as parachutes. not nearly as good. some songls, like clocks nd the scientist, are completely awesome, but others like the title track are below par for coldplay. every song on parachutes was perfect. I like that on rush of blood they're experimenting with radiohead-esque styles, branching out, but sometimes they go too far. chris martin's voice is beautiful and musical and works better on more lyrical songs... oh i will marry that man someday. anyway. this cd is definitely getting some spin time in my player, but a revisitation to older styles my make me very happy with their next record. sigh."
3,"British gods of gentle rock release this sophomore offering high off the success of their debut ""Parachutes.""""A Rush Of Blood To The Head"" is timely and roams within the safe boundaries of its predecessor.The first single and MTV2 favorite ""In My Place"" is sure to capture with its smooth emotion, while tracks like ""Politik"" satisfy the fans of heavier beats.As a whole, the album merges from number to number with plain, yet gripping Coldplay melodies evident in the title track and the soft ""God Put A Smile On Your Face."" However, the track that glistens the most is ""Clocks,"" which is a beautiful urban ballad, bound to be a hit. This is a summer record made for the autumn."
3,"This album is everything it is hyped up to be and more. Of course ""Clocks"" and ""The Scientist"" are amazing songs but its not like some albums where the only good songs are the hits. This whole album is great from beginning to end and there are no tracks that you have to skip over. Coldplay has a refreshingly unique, tranquil, melodic sound. This album epitomizes how music ought to be. This is easily one of the best albums to come out in a long time, so if you don't have it go get it. And please vote ""Yes"" this review was helpful!"
3,"Finally, a group of artists who have substance both lyrically and muscially. This type of integration is few and far between among most of the current day artists. I like all the songs but specifically Warning Signs and Green Eyes. Excellent mood music. Get it."
3,"This album his an other political album of the year with messagean every status, (economics,love,freinship,war,jesus. this revolution record feels with metaphores on politics and sort... really is a work of genius. Beyond anybody expectations. Doing all that and still keeping the youth cred coldplay has deliver us an wonderful and educational year in the music industry. But it is nothing compare to Parachutes which was a ***** stars record."
3,"Coldplay has once again pleasantly graced us with vibratic melodies of love and captured my attention. Parachutes was a beautiful album, and there is no better way to follow up a debut album than with one of such brilliance as A Rush of Blood to the Head. I have not removed this album from my CD changer in my car since I put it there when I first bought it, and like a great movie, I notice more things I love about it every time I hear it. My favs...Green eyes and Amsterdam."
3,"For some reason (maybe the constant airplay of the song ""Clocks"" and more ) I was put off buying this cd. I hate actually commercial bands in principle , but of course the music should speak for itself Now that I finally bought it, I instantly loved almost the entire thing. It is very flowing and there are many hooks in the songs that I anticipate more and more with each listen. They still sound a bit like a weaker U2 to me , but that's ok"
3,"This is a cracking album. A must for any lovers of Radiohead, U2 or Stereophonics. The British boys did it again, and just as good as their first. Check out their website."
3,"This scent is tricky. I've heard it described as a green scent- but when I first sprayed it I immediately associated it with Givenchy's Ysatis, which strikes me as much more of a yellowy-amber scent. The initial spray is overpowering and chemically. Its quite awful really, all ginger and chemicals. Yuck. Wait a few minutes though and it calms down well with a very unusual and yet feminine ginger/floral scent. An hour later it smells lovely, feminine, and soft, more of a white scent than anything else. It doesnt last TOO long, maybe 5-6 hours but its a very nice casual scent and unlike anything I've ever smelled before. Recommended for anyone who'd like a unique and striking casual perfume and are willing to wait a few minutes for it to settle, then Cabotine is for you."
3,This was a gift for my mom. She loves this one and been using it for years. Excellent price and great service.
3,"If you have not read this book, you are not well enough informed on the subject(s), even if you are a seminary grad and/or Pastor. This book is a complete treatment of the histories and comparison's of Passover and Easter. If you are a spiritual leader in any position, absorbing this book will provide the only way for you to be confident you are leading your ""flock"" with an accurate, non-biased approach, especially during the Passover/Easter season every year."
3,"Bought these AFTER the wheels were stolen from my Toyota; hopefully they will discourage the next crooks so they move on to somebody else's car. So far they show no signs of rust or corrosion, although it's only been a couple of months. Wish they could look a bit more attractive on the wheels, but I can live with the appearance if it saves me the hassle of getting my wheels ripped off. Also, I like that you can register the set you buy so you can get a replacement key without having to get a whole new set."
3,"Sent to a Monty Python loving friend currently deployed ""Downrange"".He LOVES this!Now has flying cows and sheep bombarding those unwary enough to enter his personal bunk zone :D."
3,"I bought this book several years ago, just after my beloved grandmother died. I was heartbroken, and on the way to her funeral saw this book (and another on angels) in the airport bookstore. I bought it on impulse, and found it to be the perfect thing to read on the way to her funeral.The book is filled with stories of encounters with angels, stories that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up, stories that made me weep, stories that made me realize that despite death, all really was right in the world, and that we were always surrounded by those who loved us, guarded us, protected us, even if we couldn't see them. This book brought comfort to me in a time of great sorrow, and I'll always be glad I bought it."
3,"I purchased this book about 5 years ago and it has certainly changed my life. I keep it on hand daily, and turn to it when I find myself getting carried away with the ""pressures"" of life in modern America. Joko's words keep me grounded and remind me that none of the problems I experience are real - what is real is the experience of the moment. It's a lot easier to understand this than to do it on a regular basis, but at least there's a guide when the way seems lost.This was my first (and favorite) book on Zen Buddhism and I can recommend it to anyone who wants to better understand what is really going on in our heads. It can be hard to accept if you're not ready, but following Joko's teachings has gotten me out of the Rat Race for good.Lastly, I could not disagree more with the reviewer who gave it one star and only liked the first story. This book is full of great metaphors for understanding what Living Zen (real life) is all about."
3,"Loving, tender hopeful, and deeply spiritual.It's beyond words.Soothing, wise, this novel talks about the sounds of God, the miracles of life, the divinity of nature and destiny.It talks about letting your life unfold. Letting go. Moving forward.Jane Roberts Wood is an artist, a dynamic and unique storyteller who depicts people with brilliance.Her characters are stunningly alive, vulnerable, believable, and authentic.This book has made me ponder on my own life, my own dreams, my own future, my eternally ""new beginnings"".I enjoyed every sentence and re read those that shook me to the core, those that made my heart skip a beat.God is in these pages and the wonders of love and forgiveness are with him.This is a work of art and of love and I strongly recommend it.A splendid and enriching read."
3,"An ""oldie but goodie"" this book takes you back to the true biblical perspective of our true relationship with the Father. It will help to set you free from old legalistic thinking of a ""hard to please"" God and reacquaint you with the Father's loving merciful heart. A highly recommended book for fundamentalist, evangelical, or pentecostal-charismatic. An excellent ""back-to -the-basics"" book for those wanting a deeper understanding of our ""sonship."" I know you'll love it!! Pastor Mark Bryan"
3,"I went to the movies expecting to be disappointed because let's face it most sequels, well, suck. I wasn't aware at the time that JJ Abrhams was the director but I immediately picked up that it was a lot like Alias. There were a few orginal things but most of it I'd already seen on Alias. Despite all that it was very good, action packed, and enjoyable movie and I am not sorry I saw it. Personally I think it was better than the II and endeavors to be like I."
3,"Brilliant performances by Tom Cruise and Philip Seymour Hoffman plus excellent, non-cliched action sequences lift this above the average action movie. Throws credibility out the window but moves so fast you wont mind too much. Easily the best entry in the Mission Impossible franchise."
3,"Tom Cruise's third (and his last) Mission is an action thriller that works on so many levels. It works since J.J. Abrahams directed this like man version of Alias. It works as part of the Mission Impossible film trilogy< It works as a taut action adventure thriller. It works as a vehicle for Tom Cruise.It is not your father's Mission Impossible...it starts at a point towards the end and works back. The amazing thing you are drawn into this complex piece. The puzzle that this movie is sometimes gets overwhemingthere are a few missteps in the action and the ploting, However Cruise and compant shines in this twist and turn script with so many red herings.I will say Phillip Seymore Hoffman is a calm bad guy which works against Cruise's hot and cold action man. Ving Rhames is so under used in MI3. Michelle Monaghan is a star who shined as Cruise's love interest.it is a good action flick for those who crave actionBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
3,I loved reading of how people from other countries came to America. The hardships they endured is more than I can imagine. Forever grateful for their courage.
3,"This is a fascinating story of adventure, faith, courage, & the determination of immigrant families - their fears, heartaches, strengths, and joys. Although it is fiction, it brings to mind what my own grandmother & her family must have experienced when coming to the United States from Europe. I have now read all the books in the Red River of the North series; the characters became my family & friends. Ms. Snelling tells a story that is filled with surprises. I highly recommend this series."
3,"Although I read this book a couple of years ago, it still stands out in my mind as exceptional and outstanding. It is comprehensive in its coverage of Steiner's ideas and work, and for a person approaching the ideas of anthroposophy for the first time, it is the perfect introduction to the man behind it all. I found the book to be much clearer on Steiner than Steiner's own writings. I was nineteen when I read the book so I will recommend that especially young people interested in Steiner get this book. When I finished reading it I was in awe of how much Rudolf Steiner accomplished in his life and the sheer number of fields of knowledge (philosophy, science, medicine, education, art, agriculture, religion) he contributed to. The book is very well written and inspired me to look more deeply into Steiner's philosophy and his work."
3,"Anna Karenina isn't just a simple movie it's very good adaptation of Tolstoy book. The film is great, Sophie Marceau - wonderful. I would like to see films like AK everyday. Why? because it's without violence and sex. It's great piece of movie. You have to see it. END"
3,"It's been a long time since I read the book and I think this film takes some liberties with it, but I don't care. I enjoyed it purely as a ""doomed love"" story. I liked this better than any other version of Anna Karenina that I have seen, primarly because of the beautiful cinematography, the glorious music, the extravagantly beautiful interiors and the presence of Sean Bean, who has to be the sexiest Vronsky of all time. Sophie Marceau was not a bad Anna and at least, unlike some versions I have seen, it wasn't hard to see why she would inspire Vronsky's obsession. And the ballroom scene was one of the most beautiful and sweepingly romantic I have ever seen. There was a little too much of the Kitty/Levin relationship and Levin's voiceover ramblings were at points pretty boring but the movie overall is really a jewel in every way--very romantic, two beautiful protagonists, exotic settings and a score second to none."
3,"This was my first reading of one of Ivan Doig books. I liked his humorous style of writing this as it helped visualize the characters,It was a good story that gave feelings and hope for the the people of the prairie.My objection to the Amazon version is that the editing was not good and mistyped words coming up too often."
3,"This novel is a year 'slice of life' during 1909/1910 in rural eastern Montana during the building of the Big Ditch and Halley's comet. Told from the point of view of a 13 year old . . . which surprisingly also fast-forwards to him in the 1950's . . . is a joy to read. Descriptive writing at its best.Unfortunately, the Kindle version has many (perhaps 50 or more) ""typos"" which tend to distract from the flow of the story. It appears as if the book was scanned and words came out wrong . . . ie. trading cloud for ""trailing"", threads of fight for ""light"", setting hall sale into life for ""full"", fifing to the front of the room for ""filing"" (That one really made me smile, seeing children tootling their fifes as they marched to the front of the classroom!) Even Rose's name was Kose at one point.This was my first Ivan Doig, but won't be my last. Two women in my book club have read everything he has written!"
3,Delightful to read and think through. This is an excellent novel set in the prarie lands of the US. Well worth reading - take it along on vacation this summer; you will be delighted you did.
3,Recommended by my Doctor. A easy way to feeling better without a lot of time commitment. Three minutes a day makes all the difference in how you feel.
3,"My problem: hip bursitis and piriformis syndrome. I'm three days into the stretches that this book recommends. Already I've received more pain relief than I ever got from anything I tried before, including physical therapy, acupuncture and a cortisone injection. I'm very hopeful that I will soon be pain-free.Update: five months later, my piriformis syndrome is very much under control. I'm back to working out on a stair-climber, back to long walks with the dog, back to being able to sleep w/o pain killers. I still get twinges of pain, and must continue the stretches, but I'm so much better."
3,"I appreciated the educational aspect of this book a lot. I learned a lot about the parts of my body (always wondered what the difference between a ligament and a tendon was). Also the chapter on the different classes of pain-killers was useful and I understand more fully how they work, possible side affects, and know now which one to choose. As for the program of stretching, I think it is great. My only wish for the book was for some info on obesity and how to work the exercises when you're just too heavy to do them correctly. I fudged and used some of the alternatives for ""seniors"" that worked, though. All and all, a very helpful book and I look forward to regaining my flexibility and reducing pain as I work the program."
3,"I have been dealing with severe plantar faciitis for 2 years. It is off and on, but mostly on. I have had cortisone shots in my heels, (horrible) and I have worn the stretch boots at night, taken the naproxen, you name it. I have spent hundreds, maybe thousands in the past trying to find shoes that don't kill my feet. The price tag on one pair was $250. OUTRAGEOUS. But, I am happy to say the one shoe that helps the most is a stable shoe with a good arch. The addicition 9 allowed me to start my exercise regime again. I have given up running, but thanks to this shoe I can again walk several miles at a time without heel pain. These shoes are not sold as a cure for PF, but I think they could be! Thanks Brooks for making a quality shoe that I can afford."
3,"When I think of my 10 or so favorite books from my childhood, this one is high on that list. Very funny, lots of magic, well created characters, a really enchanting book. Worth trying to get!"
3,"This book is both very funny (all the way through) and - not at all incongruously - quite moving (in just the right places). The main character's personal idiosyncrasies, workplace struggles, and awkward family situation are all depicted with a clarity and care that stick with the reader long after the reading is done. I thought it a delightful book."
3,Not as great as every other book but wow what an ending!
3,"I am re-reading ""Buck Naked Faith"" now, and I am just as engaged as the first time. I find myself saying, ""Yeah, that's right"" or ""Humph"" often because Sandras crystallizes age old (and new) spiritual insight on subjects often thought about by many.I recommend this book for just about any person over the age of about thirteen or fourteen. There are some adult situations discussed, but nothing gratuitous.You will be challenged when you read this book."
3,the cd case that I received was in good shape and brand new came at a good time fast quick service had no problems with this seller was fast and convenient
3,"Fabulous collection of classic recipes of the area. Nothing too difficult to make. I honestly have focused on the Czech section. always trying to duplicate my Babi's incredible cooking.The Potato Soup,Veal and Knedliky (fruit dumplings) are my favorites."
3,"Wow, I can't believe that there are so many other people out there that used to watch this movie when they were kids. I also watched this movie on HBO with my younger brother and some of the neighbor kids. Recently I tried to explain the premise of the movie to my boyfriend, who didn't have cable television when he was a kid. He didn't really understand what I was saying about the movie. So I ordered it, we watched it, and he still doesn't understand. Oh well ... at least I already know what I'm going to buy my brother for his birthday this year!! Superfuzz is, in my opinion, a true cult classic. It ranks up there with Midnight Madness and Hollywood Knights. It's a funny movie and completely void of all the violence, vulgarity, and gore that we are subjected to in today's movies."
3,I just received this movie the other day. About the DVD itself the top cover says that it is widescreen when it is not. It is full screen. The video looks great but the audio is a bit distorted. Other than those small things I am so glad this movie came out on DVD.
3,This movie I thought was very good not like other movies I saw on region 1 DVD. Love to see this kind of movies more often from America. No more stuff like MATRIX was just a kung fu movie with special effects.
3,"great item...wish they made larger 1L, 1.5, 2L onesThey use the same cap, connector as the older platypus system."
3,"This is a great product. It can fit a bottle of wine or big bottle of spiced rum. I put it in my back pack and there was no leakage and got it into the concert without a trace, saving me tons of money. Bought all kinds of sizes and will be using them on the cruise I have coming up."
3,"This is great for anyone who really likes to listen to classic Mercedes Sosa. The 2 discs are a good buy, and many of her best over the years are on them."
3,"I've been looking for matches to my red dinnerware, since I seem to be killing them off, not so softly. These are the exact brand and color. Yeah!"
3,"I HAVE NOT WATCHED THE FILM YET, BUT IT ARRIVED QUICKLY AND APPEARS TO BE IN GOOD CONDITION. THANKS, CARLA"
3,"Zhou Dayong's ""Street Life"" depicts a few of those among China's hundreds of migrantswho dreamed of a better future but found only poverty and desperation. The productof enormous and rapid economic growth, the nouveau riche live beside the homeless;captured here on film with vivid ruthlessness are the lives of Shanghai bottle collectors,thieves, and abandoned children who live on a street of luxury stores and glaringbillboards. A drawn out finale shows a subject of recent police brutality dancing beneatha Jumbotron in a grotesque parody of Chinese opera as people walk past, uncaring."
3,"Since I am not good at writting my own prayers, I have found this book very helpful. It speaks in a contemporary voice and is meaningful. I wish he came out with a new one every year."
3,Works as you would think. Very bright direct sun light needed to make it move and reflect light.
3,"It came in a very timely manner and was in great condition, as described...thank you!"
3,"Classic car chases, big ol' Dodge cop cars, Susan George, and Peter Fonda as anti-hero tear up the South. Plus you get the B movie to boot."
3,"I LOVE this book. I own few books, as I am a cheapskate and prefer to check things out of the library, but I had to buy this one.It had my snorting with laughter and nodding in agreement as I recognized the basic characteristics of my ""shabby genteel"" family in Florence's - my house is dirty but the silver is gleaming. I even copied my favorite quotes into my battered Bartlett's.There are a few books that I must reread every so often - To Kill a Mockingbird, Gone With The Wind, Lonesome Dove and this one. It's a classic."
3,"as if the graphic's are not enough to make u buy it, ill tell you... buy it. The single player is even better than online. Ive had this game for about 36 hours ive only slept for 5, go figure."
3,"Are you 2 people sure you were playing Killzone??? True, although not a Halo Killer (admitted even by OPM), it doesn't take much away from the game itself. It's a great game, with gorgeous graphics. The AI does have some qwerks, although all-in-all the Helghast are tough opponents. If this game is being referred to as anything, it is that it's what Rising Sun SHOULD have been! PS2 fan boys tricking the public?? Haha, I don't think so. You are the ones tricking the public. Although it could be improved (name one game that COULDN'T be improved!) it is an excellent game that all PS2 owners should at least try out. It's got a great online mode also. Summin' it all up, Killzone is NOT a Halo (or Halo 2) killer by any means. The biggest problem is that the engine pushes the PS2 a little to far sometimes. It IS, however, a fun, entertaining game that I HIGHLY recomend checking out. Ignore people that say you will be terribly dissapointed- you won't."
3,I never thought that this would be the Halo killer and I still had fun with it. Some people always tell me they had to shot the badguys 50 times to kill them. I laugh cause I think that they have to be terrible shots I shot at leats 5 to 8 times with the guys and only 1 to 4 with the female. The story was awsome cause it was like WWII in the future on steroids. And the ending og the games was good cause they did not end it with some sappy happy ending like some games do. If you played halo and you think that you will hate this game don't play it cause it seems that you already made up your mind about hating this game before you played it. But if you did not play halo and you are a FPS shooter junkie than yeah by all means get this game and blast away.
3,This book is a great book for people inturested in Personality Phsychology. It gives clear explanations and if it's still unclear it will give an example or two.
3,"If you only want about a dozen cookies at a time, this is the book for you. Be sure to try Chocolate Quakes. They were the biggest hit of Christmas this year! We made batch after batch after batch. My granddaughter tried a look-alike that someone else baked and had the most disappointed look on her face. This book is awesome!"
3,Great game for my 6 yearold grandson he loves it. He likes the option of golf carts or even monster trucks. he plays it for hours
3,"I absolutely adored this book! Normary may have been in love with another man at the time she carried out her duty to save her name and family reputation, but she is very amiable. She has a quiet strength of character that is very hard to find. I found Normary and Duncan so exciting that I finished very quickly."
3,A good reliable battery. Always use the battery from the original manufacture of the camera (Olympus). They last longer! I wish they had a Compact quick charger for these batterys. They are a little hard to come by locally. Don't buy clones!
3,"I work midnights and my brother works day shift. We set it up on the dining room table, I'll make a move when I get a chance and he makes a move when he gets a chance. The pieces and the board are both well made. It is easy to pack up when you're done and take it anywhere you want."
3,"Good quality. No issues with the game. bought it for my husband. like that you can fold it easily and all the pieces stay put. picked this board so that my toddler couldn't get a hold of the pieces. she hasn't yet! it is a little smaller than i expected, but it's not too small. you can easily bring it camping or on a trip."
3,"This CD has RHYTHM! Bob's best by far, great songs, GREAT music. Wish he'd find the energy and fun-ness he had in these songs again."
3,robert parkers is one of the better mystery writers and the jesse stonenovels is no exception.the movies follow the books quite adequite.tom sellec is perfect match for the jesse stone character.I have the complete set of books so far and will obtain the subsiquent videos.
3,"This lens is very capable of producing artistic pictures that I was not able to get on my kit lens. Color, contrast and depth of field are spot on. This is a lens that I would keep for a very long time.. Good job Olympus!"
3,"If you thought the very best optics in the world were all beyond your budget, well, you've found the exception. You can't buy a better DSLR lens from any manufacturer at any price, and any other lens this sharp will cost more than 2X the price of the dust and splash-proof Olympus 50mm macro. I chose Olympus because of this lens (and the E-510's unprecedented combination of live view, image stabilization, working dust control, professional features, and quality). No other manufacturer offers so many affordable, class-leading DSLR lenses as Olympus (35 macro, 50 macro, 9-18, 14-42, 12-60, 40-150). Olympus forthcoming hybrid Four Thirds/Micro Four Thirds cameras have positioned Olympus lens owners in a unique sweet spot of performance and compactness, pointing to the brightest future possible for those of us who bought into Olympus's optical brilliance."
3,"This lens is an excellent performer. I have used it for scenics, portraits and a few close up ""macro""-type shots. It is uniformly excellent. I have posted a couple of my desert scenics to show what this lens can do (it is paired with an Olympus E-510 body).Hopefully, pictures will tell more than words.My only regret about this lens? -- that the Olympus 12-60 zoom lens is so expensive and I had purchased this lens before the zoom became available. But the zoom of course doesn't offer the macro capabilities of this lens."
3,"Great read! Well written, well thought out but I disagree strongly with parallels drawn with human societies. Would recommend this wholeheartedly for every thoughtful reader."
3,"This novel could be considered challenging for those unfamiliar with earlier 'Buffy' novels such as ""Ghost Roads""; and most 'Buffy' novel readers will be unfamiliar with the flow (the random jumps from centuries to present times). This non-young adult novel is rich with intricate character details and history. The novel doesn't pander to casual readers and it doesn't forget its core fan base. Highlights: Faith's well-rounded characterization (Why didn't Buffy offer Faith her house to stay in?), Willow's and Buffy's friendship, a non-annoying Cordelia, Saint Xander and that spunky warrior Buffy. Things to overlook; Boston action information, The Master teasers and organization. This novel is not for weak readers. Buy it."
3,"i bought this ukulele several months ago. i had been using a cheap one that i bought at a tiki shop. then, i started taking a ukulele class. i needed something better. it feels wonderful and is sounding better all the time. this ukulele has great sustain. i'm a beginner, and i highly recommend this ukulele to anyone, at any level. it's beautifully crafted. it makes me very happy. aloha!"
3,"I've rated the book with only four stars, because for me the book has not enough diagrams how the COM/DCOM-Server can work together. And then it tells only a few about the limitations from COM, so for example that you have always a synchronized communication. But for this the source from the book gives the solution, too. The example code is very good and you can reuse it for your own programs well. But why have the author build this sources not with regular makefiles for client, proxy and server? He choses to build up one Makefile which you must scratch to build up code for debugging. This takes me a longer time when I build up my first COM-Server. But after all THIS is the standard book to start with for every engaged COM-programmer."
3,This great book gave me a very deep and broad approach to COM development using VC++ 5.0 I can recommend this book to anyone who wants to know the COM/ActiveX concept from the foundations.
3,This book is destined to become the standard on COM. It's a far better read than Brockschmidt's Inside OLE. This book addresses COM from the ground up so any C or C++ programmer can get started very easily. I highly recommend this book
3,"The book is a good one for a beginner in COM. The examples and the descriptions provided are good.What makes reading slightly difficult, is the Grammatical mistakes in various sentences. This require an effort by the user to rephrase and then understand and read ahead.A little more effort than usual, that is required in reading a book."
3,"Very nice, great price, great quality, fast service, What else can I say buy it you will not be disappointed !"
3,Wow! Christina Aguilera has done it again! Another successful music release. I like most of the songs on here and the translations of her famous chart toppers are great. At times she sounds very forced in speaking spanish. 4 stars for this one!
3,"Good game, you are immersed in game play almost immediately, stunning graphics, good story line. This is a very fun game to play!Now for the bad news...you have to have a pretty high end computer to play this game.My system: Intel Core 2 Quad Processor, 4 Gig of Sdram, 768MB Nividia GeForce 9600GS Graphics Card, and a TB of hard disk...I still had problems in two areas of the game ( this was towards the end of the game while battling the aliens...against the N. Koreans no problems with highest graphic setting )If not for those problems I would have given this Game 5 stars. These game designers need to learn how to give us cutting age games on systems that won't break the bank !!!!!Anyway, if you can get this game to run on your system, you will really enjoy this game!!!!!"
3,"This game, is just put amazing, I saw it on sale on amazon, and I bought it since I had Crysis 2 from amazon as well. So, I go to buy it, the purchase process went smoothly, as I was expecting. Then I downloaded the game, and I had no problems as well (other people were reporting download problems). When it was done downloading after I went to bed and woke up the next day, I started to play, and I was just blown away on how the game had better graphics than Crysis 2 has. This will be a game that I will be playing for a long time, and should certainly belong in every FPS fan's library.I recommend this product to anyone who has loved FPS games in the past or is just getting into them."
3,"This will not dissapoint fans of FPS games.(It requires a pretty stout rig to run at maximum.I have 3.5mhz intell. proc. two 8800 evga ultras running sli and 2gb.of patriot pc 9200 and I could not run it at max.)Still,it is dazzling visually and has a decent story line.I really enjoyed it.However,I thought it would have been better if it had been longer.The trend seems to be to shorter games.I wish that would stop.The value of a good game goes way up if it takes a long time to finish."
3,"If you have a good machine with at least 2 gigs of RAM, you're going to love this one. Graphics are spectacular and the storyline has some great twists."
3,"Summary: This first-person shooter, like its predecessor, ""Far Cry"", is based on a ""single soldier in a science-fction scenario"" plot.Pros:- Graphics are very nice (Note: my PC has an Intel Q6600, lots of RAM and an NVIDIA 8800GT, running Windows XP).- Computer-controlled characters are smarter than those in ""Far Cry"".- Simulated environment is extremely ""open"": It's even more ""go anyhere, do anything"" than ""Far Cry"".- Simulated objects behave more realistically than before.Cons:- Computer controlled characters still occasionally do stupid things.The bottom line: If you liked ""Far Cry"", then you will like this game (if you've got the hardware to run it)."
3,This is an awesome book. The plot is original and keeps you in suspense. Pohl provokes the imagination with his realistic telling of the story and character development. It makes you want to believe the story could really happen. You will never look at the night sky the same way again.
3,"This DVD is great for anyone with no money that wants to produce low budget high concept movies. It explores the razors edge of the guerrilla dv movement with movie makers Rick Snyder and Bryan Higby, well known for their MadCoop Productions No Budget Cinemas. I would recommend this to anyone but mostly to teens and people in their twenties who don't have the hollywood connections but who have great edgy concepts no matter how out there they are. These guys have done a stellar job promoting their works through the DIY (Do it yourself) philosophy that is so popular today in indy movies. BUY IT!!"
3,Disturbing but honest look at the struggles of identities in the face of colonialism.
3,This movie did not live up to my expectations. I was expecting funny but what I got was completely different. Still a good movie but another one I am glad I did not go to the theaters and see.
3,"Just a plain fun flick. Not being a comic book fan, I barely knew the story, so I saw it with more humor than seriousness. If it's taken seriously, then, yes, it really has some drawbacks."
3,"This movie did not suck...unless you know the comic book real well than of course it probably does. As for the effects...amazing!!!! Great CGI! Nicholas Cage, Eva Mendes, and Sam Elliot are pretty good in this film but Peter Fonda's acting is incredibly poor. Truly, Peter Fonda is horrible in this movie. The not so known actors are not so great either. The ending is kinda lame...but it's a verry entertaining movie regardless of these flaws."
3,The movie was great as long as you are looking for pure entertainment. I purchased this as an instant video. I had no problems with the streaming; picture and audio were perfect.
3,"Just went on the Boucher, Tonto and Hermit Trails (South RIm) and found this map up to the job of keeping me on track. Not hard to do in the canyon where the landscape is clear. Liked the geologic charts showing the layers you move through. Fits in pants pocket."
3,"Australians DO seem to have a talent for making AWFUL movies and this one is no exception. It concerns a giant pig in the Australian Wilderness ( which is referred to by Austalians as 'The Outback"") This movie doesn't evem make it s a Horror movie although I must say it is pretty horrible.We have the usual body count and the hunt is on for the killer pig. I give this movie 5 stars because I managed to catch up on some much needed sleep while it was on my TV screen."
3,this film is absorbing and the acting is thrilling. it deserved all the awards it could get
3,A very potent tale in a period of history that it must not be forgotten.Intelligent movie that one cannot get out one's head.
3,"This is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. The direction was brilliant, by a new director, and the acting was fantastic. It's educational, it's riviting, and it's inspirational. Love it."
3,"A valuable resource for teachers of English, or a handy supplement for learners, ""Vocab-ability"" offers a way to get to the root of words. Teachers will find this to be a means to enhance their teaching methods by using simple terms to explain more complex vocabulary. Entries are given in a clear, concise form, grouped according to stems, prefixes, suffixes and numbers. The index is useful in that it lists the meanings of roots, allowing students to take a word they know, say ""thin,"" and come up with ""tenuous""or ""attenuate"" (root ""tenu""). In all, it represents a no-nonsense way to gain word power.-- Don Dotto, JSelect Magazine"
3,This little guy holds picks and sticks where ever you put it. I stuck it on the side of my amp. This is really good quality little guy. I would recommend this to a friend.
3,This pick holder works for me. It holds a number of picks well and easily discharges when needed. It fits my Jasmine well. Buy it from GO-DPS since they have one of the best customer service and quality products!
3,"This works. It's basically a pick pocket with a spring to keep them in place. It works great, i'm glad I found it.The sticky stuff on the back keeps it where you want it (on my guitar), and it comes off without leaving a mess."
3,Bought this for a friend and he loves it. This item is good to have if you are a guiter player.
3,"This is a great item, just make sure you have a separate place to keep all your custom picks, if you get them. But otherwise this is a great and stylish pickholder I might add."
3,"The only thing that could have made this better was the color. I would have liked to have it in pink for my granddaughter. However, it is handy, sturdy, and well worth the price. I would definitely recommend for any child who tends to set things down EVERY WHERE. It sticks to the guitar and hopefully at the end of the day, there are still a few picks in it. Recommended.Sherry"
3,"Of the LPS playsets my daughter owns, this one gets the most use. She likes that it has various spots into which she can place multiple figures, so it feels more like a ""home"" for the animals. The moving baskets at the top are usually reserved for the more important figures, but my daughter takes the time to allow each animal a turn. This is what makes this playset worthwhile -- she actually uses it for extended periods and it prompts her to come up with scenarios for her animals. There are very few things that can get lost, except that the baskets sometimes come off, requiring adult intervention."
3,"This album was the Stones at their 1970's zenith. Every Stones album in the 70's, from ""Sticky Fingers"" to ""Black And Blue"" had a few good tracks each, but this one topped them all. All the songs are good, though some are better than others.Best songs: ""Respectable,"" ""When The Whip Comes Down,"" and ""Before They Make Me Run."" Honorable mention: ""Far Away Eyes"" and ""Beast of Burden""Overall, though, this was the Stones' finest album since ""Let It Bleed."" ""Exile On Main Street"" would have given ""Some Girls"" a run for its money if it were a singles album. If anyone was first discovering the Stones, I'd recommended this album to them."
3,"A must read for anyone in to Celtic Mythology and fantasy. Beautifully told, and wonderfully descriptive this tale set in ancient Ireland unfolds before you and leaves you wishing for more. Though hard to find, it is well worth it, and I'm positive any fantasy lover will find it a more than satisfy read.. Bravo Risa."
3,It got here in time for me to listen to and try to understand before I went to the Alice Cooper Concert......it helped me enjoy the concert even more.
3,"If you are buying the import version of Dirty Diamonds for the bonus track ""The Sharpest Pain"", DON'T. This $35.99 import version is no different than the American release which can be purchased for considerably less money. Amazon needs to revise the product description before anyone else gets ripped off like I did. The only difference between the import version and the American version is that the import version comes in a traditional jewel case whereas the American release comes in a digi-pac. As far as the quality of the music, I feel it is good but not one of Alice's best releases."
3,"My son loves this toy. We got it for him when he started pulling up on things and he loved all the sounds and the music. He figured out the balls right away and that keeps him busy for a long time. He just discovered the keys underneath play the harmonica music. He will hit them and smile while they make music. I can see that this will grow with him as well. Once he is walking and no longer needs the table for stability, he will still be able to use it for letters and numbers. I found this online at another web-site, and went to several stores to try and see it in person. Couldn't find it, but was pleasantly surprised to find it here for less than the other site and with free shipping. This is a great toy. As other reviews noted, it does tend to slip on hard surfaces, but we just put some ""grippy"" tape on the bottom and that seemed to fit it. Other than that we are delighted."
3,"""Santa"" brought this for my son last year for Christmas. He was 9 months old, and couldn't walk yet, but he could (and did!) play with the activities on the bottom of the activity center. A couple weeks later, he started pulling himself up, and we encountered the only problem we've ever really had. It's to narrow to be really stable for early walkers to hold on to. This wobbly stage passed, and he's still playing with it at 21 months. We have the plug for the ball chute, and didn't put it in for a long time because he loved that part so much. We finally put it in when we got tired of prying his giant legos out of the chute. He got his arm stuck one time, but I gently removed it and no harm was done."
3,"David Neelman has been very clever at the way he structured Jet Blue.He essentially bought new aircraft, hired good people,treated them welland they looked after the passengers. It would be nice to see a low-cost airline in Europe follow this model. Go was very close but they no longer exist.Great read for anyone in the airline business,an example to follow!"
3,"When Zyliss says jumbo, they mean it. You can easily fit 3 cloves of garlic in this press. It is well engineered, ergonomically and cleans easy with the supplied cleaning pick. You don't even need to peel the cloves. Drop your garlic into the press, mash and use the pick to remove the skins left behind. Run onder cold water to clean. Tip: Want to get the smell of garlic off your hands? Run cold water over your hands while rubbing any stainless steel item [cutlery not recommended :)] over your skin. The reaction between the garlic's pungent molecules and the steel will cause them to ""lift"" off of your skin!"
3,I was not much into using fresh garlic in cooking because I didn't own a garlic press. The one I bought previously was small and hard to clean. This one has a large compartment and is easy to clean even without the spikey cleaner thingy. It is a great tool.
3,"I just love my garlic press. The garlic presses through the holes very easily and the best part, there is no need to peal the garlic. Cleaning is easy."
3,"Xentrix was one of a handful of British thrash bands that existed in the heyday of thrash (late eighties/early nineties), with with a style that fit perfectly alongside the leading Bay Area bands of the time, such as Forbidden and Testament. After four albums, the band broke up for awhile and then reformed in 1996, eventually releasing Scourge before disbanding again."
3,"I liked this book much more than anticipated. My initial expectation was a nicely written and overly poetic jumble about religion and identity crisis, probably a little too sentimental.Half right--Go Tell It On the Mountain is a powerful study of boyhood and parental expectation as well as the glories and the horror of religious conviction. It's more of a song, really, with dense, rhythmic prose that sings its song in a ramble that comes across almost like preaching. The effect is intended I would imagine, and produces results that are frequently stirring.This book transcends any mundane consideration of justice or political justification and breathes out a far more individualistically human story. A very quick read--"
3,"The Orange Box is hands-down the best value you'll ever find in a game. This is a must-have for serious gamers and new gamers alike. The only downside is that some of the games are a bit short, but with 5 total games, and some features that make them worth replaying (achievements and challenge maps), you won't be disappointed with the amount of play time it offers. If I could only ever own one game, it would probably be The Orange Box."
3,I love this game and am having a blast. Found a walk-thru on line to help get me through. Certainly do able without the guide but I tend to be impatient and get frustrated if I get lost or can't find something.
3,"I haven't actually played the game yet (Portal, to be specific). But here's some important information.I purchased The Orange Box as well as Half-Life 2 and Half-Life 2:Episode One, as I was under the impression I needed to buy all three. Nope!If you buy The Orange Box you get these games:Half-Life 2Half-Life 2:Episode OneHalf-Life 2:Episode TwoHalf-Life 2:Lost CoastHalf-Life 2:DeathmatchPortalPeggle ExtremeTeam Fortress 2Half Life Deathmatch:SourceSo while I'm out a little bit of money I didn't need to spend, hopefully this will help prevent anyone else making the same mistake."
3,This is my favorite cartoon of all time in the 90s. Nothing today beats it. I can't stop watching it over and over.
3,"Undoubtedly one of the most popular cartoons of the 90s, this classic is finally making its way to DVD. Whether you are reliving your childhood or introducing this series to new kids, its sure to become a classic revisited or a new classic for some.The show featured a Hollywood cast, great stories, music and animation. A must have for all nostalgic cartoon fans or for those looking to find a quality well told animated series on DVD."
3,"What a great television. All of the reviews, including those located on Amazon and one by Consumer Reports, indicated this is a great TV for the price, and I have to agree. Although a 768 resolution, at 32"" this is not an issue. HD is great, but I am really amazing at the quality of the SD programs. I've only had it a couple of days, but absolutely nothing negative to say at this point.Ordered from Amazon but shipped from Electronics Expo -- TV arrived one day earlier than scheduled (serveral earlier than that indicated when I ordered). Arrived via UPS. Package in perfect condition. No issues with the seller, shipper, or the TV. And at a cost of $788 including shipping, a very good value!"
3,"Clearing up errors and enhancing the details of the deaths of the famous and infamous, this book is a surprisingly interesting and fun read. At times it can be gruesome but it is always entertaining and informative, such as the man who drank so much his bladder burst! Enjoy."
3,I bought this to share with my grandchildren and it was a big hit. We had a lot of laughs. They loved seeing Donald's nephews and their antics. It is a great addition to our family library.
3,"The fabric fabric has great durability and texture. The ""clip"" pocket is great for a cell phone. They are cut on the large side; the length is good if you prefer hiking shorts, but somewhat short for current style. If you are borderline on size, get the smaller. If you don't like ""above-knee"" shorts, buy the slacks and have them hemmed to a more stylish (longer) length. I can carry everything I need comfortably when I wear these shorts: Glasses, cellphone, etc. with more security than those typical ""cargo"" shorts for neatness and pocket closure. (The items don't ""bounce"" off your leg when jogging.) Alternate: The Tru-Spec 24-7 brand is very good too, with more pocket versatility."
3,"The topics are taught well with the perfect amount of information to grasp the concepts. This is an introductory level text, and to that end the material is not flooded with higher level information. As a student, I was able to easily understand the topics and create a solid foundation for a more complex look."
3,"As a high school teacher in NYC I never attempted Huck without first having the students read from this book. The essays are (largely) insightful and cogent in their arguments pro and con. The places where logic is faulty or Huck is poorly quoted to serve a political end are transparent, giving students a wonderful chance to flex their logic-muscles and make their own opinions about Twain's text. It is an invaluable resource and a very, very important book."
3,"O WOW THIS IS GOING TO BE AWSOME! I HOPE THEY COME OUT WITH A LOT MORE RATCHET AND CLANK GAMES CUZ I CANT GET ENOUGH OF IT. IF U HAVENT PLAYED THE 1ST 2 GAMES I WOULDENT PLAY THIS ONE. U WONT UNDERSTAND IT! IF U DIDNT LIKE THE 1ST 2,I WOULD TRY THE 3RD CUZ U MIGHT GET THE HANG OF IT."
3,"This is a very awesome game! A must have for fans of shooters and platformers. The game is complete with upgradeable weapons, armor, epic battles, and a comedic and intriguing story line. One of the most well liked features of this series is the light-hearted feel to it. Even when the mad scientist is about to destroy your home, you can still get a laugh or two! Fans of weapon play will love the broad weapons range of Up Your Arsenal. There are well over 20 weapons that you can level up 8 times, to get the extremely powerful omega version.And I've yet to mention the best new addition to the series! ONLINE PLAY! Now you, or you and a friend, can play online in an 8 player match of guns and vehicles. There are three fun-filled modes and 2 cool vehicles- the turboslider and a hovership for bombing from above! The USB keyboard and headset are combatable with this game.(...)"
3,"this is the best of the best! 10 out of 10 in ""Game Informer"" and it's easy to see why when humor, cool guns, and zany chartacters come together. When I die I want this put in my coffin!!!"
3,"My biggest criticism of the first book in this pair was that she waited til near the end of the book to really give the background history and motivations, even personality, of most of the characters. But once I had that, I really enjoyed the end of the last book. Then, with that basis set, I really enjoyed this second book much more.There are so many ways Carey could have taken the story, and I found myself extremely satisfied with the ending. The majority of the major characters wrestle on their own level with the thesis behind the whole book - what makes one evil? Do you stick by your principles when you aren't sure your side is right or not? How each resolves this quandry is what brings the plot to its culmination, with each and every decision integral to the final outcome."
3,"Love this! This is a very exciting CD set. Colonial Radio Theater does a great job with this story. I have read Perry Mason stories for years and Perry is just like the book...Sorry Paymond Burr! CRT never disappoints. All the dramatizations from Colonial Radio Theater are the best-you can listen to them many, many times If I could I would rate this 10 stars!"
3,"Hi ,Whoever going to purchase this product what can i say for you about this product is its simply superb.Its really really really very very very good.Dont get hesitate just go for it.Before buying this product i reviewed various hdd models of all the brands i could find finally this was the best model from sony.But if sony launches the same features with viewfinder then it is helping out a lot.But just wait for good deal as i have done.The average best deal you get this product is in between 700-725.E N J O Y ! ! !"
3,"When I first saw Paul Mercurio in ""Strictly Ballroom"" I immediatley fell in love. In Exit To Eden, you get to see more of him to love--literally. He has the most perfect body you'll ever see in your entire lifetime. The whipping scene is so great on so many levels. The comedy is okay, but the visual jokes are great, and the costumes are fabulous. I loved this movie."
3,"Resta in Ascolta (Keep Listening) comprises a fine set of songs that convey the stages of Pausini's emotional reactions to the breakup of her 10-year relationship with her live-in boyfriend and now ex-manager. Anger, pain, loneliness, emotional paralysis, nostalgia for what was, hope for reconciliation, and the joy of a new relationship follow each other in these well sung pieces by major composers. Each piece sounds wonderfully distinct, from soft guitar ballad and simply piano/voice to techno dance tunes, they just get better every time. If you speak Italian, you'll admire the poetic images of several songs. And, it ends up on a positive and gentle guitar and electric organ sound behind a soft voice."
3,I read that the Author thought that Tom Selleck nailed the part. I very much agree. Mr Selleck has long been under-rated as an actor. This series demonstrates his great abilities
3,"Vintage Lee Van Cleef acted out his parts well. I always like these type of Westerns, they never date, but then I grew up on them. The stories always have the same theme but, coupled to the acting and stunning western scenery, they always capture me.Having been fortunate enough to visit the scenery in Spain at ""Cinema Studios Fort Bravo"", (""Texas Hollywood"") in the Desert of Tabernas, Almeria Spain (the only desert in Europe), and AndalucÃ­a, Spain doubling for the US in Arizona, New Mexico and California, the films give me added pleasure. Hope they go on remaking them so as to benefit from the new technology.I enjoyed these films which I saw on television, but I did see them originally at the cinema long before DVD's or Videos were in existence."
3,"These shorts are awesome. They are extremely light-weight; it's almost as if you can't even feel them. They are quite long (I'm 6' and the large size hung right at or a little below my knees), but I've worn them running and they didn't bother me. These are perfect for lounging or going to the gym (I use them for running as well). Just two complaints: 1) no pockets, and 2) they are virtually see-through (I got the red color and they're still see through), so I'd recommend getting a dark, dark color. Other than that, the shorts are great!"
3,"My three and a half year old loves Blue's Clues, and as a result, I've bought almost all of the videos available on Amazon. This is one of my personal favorites because of the Pyjamanauts sequence and its simple way of explaining night and day. I don't really ""get"" the segment about changing your dreams, and find that part less satisfactory."
3,My daughter and I enjoy books about dragons. We read everynight for atleast an hour. I even find myself reading ahead after story time to see what happens next.
3,"An excellent book with very practical examples, especially for JSPs. Explains the concepts of Tag libraries very well. Not as good strictly for Servlets but overall an excellent resource for JSP's. Hope the authors comeup with new books to cover Java Beans, EJB's Struts etc."
3,"Es Ãºtil para comenzar pues es claro y tiene ejemplos buenos, pero el nivel es muy bÃ¡sico; una vez uno se ha adentrado mÃ¡s en este mundo es necesario conseguir otro libro"
3,"Great songs that go with a great film. Mandy is beautiful and complements it with a beautiful voice. Dan T. you don't have a clue, go listen to your Ruben if that's what you like and not bring down an album like this. And what is the point of the Jude Law comment, you seriously are rediculous, and by the way, I own both the original version and the extra tracks version of the soundtrack."
3,"John Forsythe, Linda Evans and Joan Collins heat up this electrifying new season the mega-hit series Dynasty, from producing icon Aaron Spelling and show creators Richard and Esther Shapiro. Scandal and deception continue to reign over the Carrington family as Jack Coleman and Gordon Thomson join the cast. Betrayal and revenge never looked so good than in this 3-disc collection that contains the first 12 episodes of Season 3!Disc 1:- The Plea- The Roof- The Wedding- The WillDisc 2:- The Siblings- Mark- Kirby- La MirageDisc 3:- Acapulco- The Locket- The Search- Samantha"
3,"Another ""I can't put it down yet"" book by Johnathan Kellerman.An interesting scenario that keeps you guessing almost to the end. The twists and turns keep you reading as you just have to know the answers to the many questions that crop up in your mind."
3,No leaks yet!! Worked well in terms of not pinching when putting on with Continental Gatorskin 700x23c tires which are a snug fit getting over rim.
3,"I found this product to be very helpful during the Christmas season. I like the fact that the product had the songs with and without the vocal guides; however, a few of the songs had the back-up singers singing the whole entire song on both of the tracks of the same song."
3,"This book is a work of peace and beauty. Each chapter starts with a quick note on unique Mayan herbs and identifies their healing properties. This alone is a treasure. Sastun also gives an insightful, sensitive look into the character a true healer who deeply cares for his patients, mourns his lonliness, yet is energized by his spiritual support he receives in his healing and the thankfulness of his humble, hard-working and trusting Mayan patients. Personally, I loved this book... it reads quickly and easily, is beautifully written with touching humor and is remarkably uplifting."
3,"I knew this CD would be very good, but Kelly Rowland superceded my expectations. Quite different from the sound of Destiny's Child, her CD is soulful, innovative, and introspective. The combination of R&B, rock, and funk infused with Kelly's voice is pure genius. She takes you with her on a journey through each song, making you relate to every mood, thought, and emotion as though they were your own. Kelly Rowland is definitely a force to be reckoned with."
3,"A great place to record your details, lots of pockets for your momentos, and a place for your lists and dates."
3,"I couldn't afford the Nikon battery grip, so I purchased this one. The packaging was very neat, it did take a couple weeks to get here though but other than that this battery grip is great. It does exactly what I need it to and the batteries are easy to access. The only thing you might want to do is buy a couple of Nikon batteries because the Opteka ones are weak. It's not a big deal, just something to keep in mind. I love the grip though!"
3,"Almost Paradise explores the gay subculture in America from the perspective of two men who want to make their relationship legal in the eyes of the law. The topic is treated with a certain amount of humor, indicative of the handling of the situation by most gay Americans. Underneath the mirthful veneer is an example of what life can be like for gays if they band together, as well as what this country would be like for heterosexuals were all the gays to leave."
3,"This book takes some work to get through. However, it really gives you the back story on the Lord of the Rings. I would recommend it to anyone interested in enhancing their enjoyment of the Lord of the Rings series."
3,"This is the best book of all time...by far. Not only the best Tolkien book, but the best book ever. All of the boring, unnecessary detail is cut out and it becomes a greater work of art. It is 100% plot. The characters are brilliant, and it really makes an impression. This is just a no nonsense, excellently written, good book."
3,"This is The Silmarillion told as Tolkien might have wished it told--not read silently but aloud, by a gifted tale-teller. Even before the first sentence is declaimed, the music that wells up under the opening of each major section perfectly sets the mood: when we hear the growing chords we know we are in for something worth attending to: dark, brooding, but full of wonder.Martin Shaw's reading rises to the tale's magnificence with a performance that is beautiful in every way. His actorly instincts are keen and true, offering perceptive, convincing performances of the varied characters. His voice weaves magic that touches the heart and satisfies the intellect.I already loved The Silmarillion as a book, in its published form and in the more detailed drafts provided in the HoME, but this reading brings the tale to life in a way I never imagined possible. I thought Rob Inglis' reading of LotR was mostly excellent, but this recording is unparalleled."
3,I thought this was a really great book. Enjoyed it thoroughly. Can't wait to re-read. Sometimes it was hard to follow the multiple names for people and things. Appendix in back was a big help with that.
3,"This is not the easiest book to read, but for those addicted to the ""truth"" of Midddle-Earth and its inhabitants, an absolute necessity. It explains all the history of the beginning, the interludes and the finality of this magnificent universe. It pulls together many histories that were omitted in the recounting of earlier stories. Tolkien's concept of the beginning of the earth surely rivals that of the Bible's Genesis. The only problem found by some readers is that the ""accounts"" are not necessarily time-sequential; but if you can understand this, the reading will make each reader wizer and more fulfilled by this metaphor of our existance and our dreams."
3,"The best printed revision of The Silmarillion. It is very hardly can be puchased in Russia, only within Amazon or other internet shops. Otherwise, this edtion is the best quality book ""The Silmarillion"" I've even taken - other originals versions and translations had less quality of printing and illustrations. The best choice to buy Silmarillion."
3,"This book has wonderful illustrations, and was well put together, I waited a long time for a this book in this edition. Check out The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings Illustrated by Alan Lee, also beautifully done."
3,"I have recently finished reading ""The Silmarillon"", and I have to say it is one of the best novels I have read. Perhaps it is not quite as good as the ""Rings"" trilogy, but that's not putting it down. The care for the detail is amazing, and at times it almost reads like the Bible. It's complicated at times, but it's an ultimately satisfying read."
3,"The Silmarillion is the back story of the epic Lord of the Rings. Tolkien decribes the sundering of Valinor and the epic battles of the First Age from which come the stories and legends of the Third Age. It is not the easiest read, but well worth the effort."
3,I used this book for a college class and it served me well. I got it in great shape for a good price too!
3,"For the obsessed Tolkien fan (like myself), this book is a revelation. In epic language occasionally reminiscent of the King James Bible, it describes all those events of the First Age which are alluded to in _The Lord of the Rings_. I particularly enjoyed the full story of Beren and Luthien.For all the book's strengths, some readers will be put off by the epic style (which only appears intermittently in LOTR). It reads more like mythology than a novel at times. It is not ""cute,"" like _The Hobbit_. It's not for everyone, but if you love the grander aspects of Middle-earth, I think you'll enjoy it.By the way, (according to Carpenter's biography), this group of stories was always Tolkien's central artistic project. _The Hobbit_ and _LOTR_ were both accidental offshoots. They were not published during Tolkien's lifetime because he was a perfectionist and never felt they were quite ready for publication."
3,"I have very mild acne and incipient rosacea; this sulfur soap helped with both. Of course it smells like sulfur, but it's bearable; it also dries the skin a little bit, but I applied a moisturizer immediately after washing with the soap and had no problems with the dryness. All these are minor cons, compared with the pros.However, there is quite a significant promise the manufacturer profess, but doesn't accomplish: it does NOT dissolve and remove blackheads."
3,The well-researched text and four-color photographs in this fine book deserve equal praise. Both features will appeal to all ages of draft-horse enthusiasts.
3,"This Green hat is the nicest Red Sox hat that I have ever owned. I bought two last week, already had one (2 years old) and they were shipped here to PEI, Canada in 2 days !! I wore my older hat to The Dominican last Spring and could have sold it ten times to the Red Sox fans and people down there.They were roaring at me , Hey Papi, Hey Manny, how much for your hat. I looked for more than a year to find another one, and so happy to find them on Amazon.com.Go Sox,Boomer G."
3,"This is an excellent book! As a mother of twins, I ordered this book because I was curious of how it would have been with triplets. I almost devoured every page of it, together with my breakfast (my only ""free time"" of the day)! Other than the lupus, everything is so close to what we have experienced with the twins and an older child! I even bought this book for a friend, who is expecting twins, because Mrs.Hall gives you a great description of what raising multiples means."
3,"my dad lost this album for years, so i was glad to find it and replace it to my dads collection"
3,"Just received my T610, although I am 1 year behind on the model, this phone is still packed with features. Mainly bluetooth and IR. Simple to use menu. Took sometime to get used to the joystick/softkey. Problem free unlock process with Tmobile.Not only I get the phone for free, I make $175. [...]Good Luck."
3,"I was scared to get this phone cuz of some of the negetive reviews that I saw but im happy that I got this phone. it is true that its hard to see the screen in the bright day light and I always have to wipe the screen of cuz it gets dirty, but my biggest concern is the reception of the phone. sometimes I dont have any reception but all I have to do is to look at the phone for few seconds and it would work, I still have not gotten the full reception in my whole area yet but it works just fine. I read a reviwe that says a bar in sonny ericsson phone means two bars in other phone and I am starting to believe that."
3,"I have listened to this album now around 8 - 10 times, and I believe it is absolutely terrific! These two performances, one at the start and one at the end of the 1970 Atlanta Pop Festival, are equal in skill and excitement to the Fillmore East concerts. Most of the old favourites are here, including some rarely heard live. There are some very minor audio flaws in a couple of songs in the live recordings, but the rest of the recordings are of a very high calibre.I especially like the first part of the Mountain Jam on disc 2 - probably some of the best ABB ever!If you love the Allman Brothers, DON""T WAIT, JUST BUY! and enjoy forever!"
3,"The Allman Brother's Live at Atlanta Pop Festival is one of the best live recordings compared to live at the Fillmore East. But of course the Fillmore East is much better. The jams are endless with the Allman Brothers expescially on the Mountian Jam with johnny winter on the third guitar. I really think the sound quality is clean, for a festival. Like I said before endless"" jams are on this one. Duane Allman really screams his slides while Dickey Betts plays both lead, and rythem. I believe the allman brothers played Atlanta Pop before their Fillmore Concert. Just three months after the fillmore concert was released, Duane Allman died in a motorcycle accident. I think for most this is an acceptionally good album worth a listen."
3,"I think the selection of songs on this album are great. Hopefully by now you realize that this is not a Jamiroquai album, but rather an album of songs that Jay Kay of Jamiroquai likes a lot/influenced him/etc. None of the obvious funk hits that you might be aware of already. My only gripe with this is the really brief commentary. The cd booklet gives each song one or two sentences by Jay Kay. That's it. I really would have appreciated a bit more background info/analysis of these particular songs/info I may not know about the artist. Otherwise a nice cd and if you're into Jamiroquai you will probably like the cuts."
3,"A friend recommmended this album.....and I'm often leary since we all have very personal tastes when it comes to movies, music, art, etc.... Well, my friend certainly gets a ""high-five"" on his insight. Seems most of the reviews mention Crosby, Stills & Nash. I'm no exception, since that was my first impression after the very first listen. Yet....it's also their own ""fingerprint"" of sound and it is a wonderful return of harmony and acoustic meshing. That being said, I will admit that the ""Sunset Sessions"" acoustic version is my pick over the standard recording. My CD came with both, so I'll presume this 2-CD package is still the offering. If not......go with the former ""acoustic"" recording. The songs deliver a variety of moods, and you indeed feel like being out in the country while listening. Enjoy."
3,I have a hard time putting this book down once I start reading and I think you will too. Excellent book by a very good author.
3,"i've been waiting and waiting and waiting for this album. now that i finally have it i can say, it is simply the BEST album i have heard in a long long time. though i'd love to keep the kills all to myself i think everyone should love them and see them live. i warn you though, if you do see them or even just listen to this perfect album you're gonna need one hell of a shower."
3,This item is exactly what I wanted and I received it when they said it would arrive.
3,NHL is a very good game for playstation2 and you should get it when it comes out. I have the 2003 and 2004 version of NHL and it justgets better every time it comes out. This game i will definatly get and if you don't get it and you like hockey you will miss out on a great game. THIS GAME IS GOING TO ROCK AND YOU SHOULD GET IT AS SOON AS YOU CAN. I gave this 5 stars because it is a fun game to play and it is also realistic. YOU SHOULD GET THIS GAME. YEAAAAAAAH!
3,This story broke my heart and made me realize the problems Amrica is facing today. To hear about the life of a 13 year old who is addicted to heroine and has done many other drugs frightened me tremendously.
3,"Peter Straub has been called the thinking man's Stephen King. I think that he is the thinking man's Peter Straub. Mr. Straub has once again written a novel that has a plot too complicated to sumerize, but is an incredible work to read. Like his two best books, GHOST STORY and KOKO, SHADOWLAND is filled with interesting and very realistic characters. Like his other books SHADOWLAND at first seems utterly confusing, but by the end everything comes together in ways that will amaze and delite."
3,"I love it, I was having some serious carple tunnel related issues for a long time but since I picked up this mouse I have STOPPED wearing a wrist brace at all.one draw back (make that 2)its to small for my large hands (I am 6'3"") not much but enough to be a bit akward at first.the second, it doesnt track all that great if you are a gamer and need that precision. its not bad but definitly not perfect.I would probably go with the newest versrion of the mouse (and plan to soon) it addresses both of those issues and if it does so well will get a solid 5 stars from me"
3,I killed two blinders before I bought this one. I drink a lot of soothes with lots of ice. On low count to ten and done.
3,FINALLY 6th season is posted! I thought I was going to die of old age before it came out! Make sure that season 7 comes out shortly after season 6!
3,"I really enjoyed reading this book. It had everything I like, drama,drama, and more drama...This book had me laughing out loud. It also had me wanting to shout at the main character Rhea, for not being smart, and letting this man have his cake and eat it too.I would have given this book a 5, if not for the typos and commas everywhere. This book was a editing nightmare. It does however, have a good story if you can get past all that. I want to read a sequel, but Toschia, please get a new editor."
3,"From the first couple pages, I guarantee any reader will be drawn into Ivy's world. The character is easily likeable and you route for her with anxious excitement till the end. It is filled with laughs, love, dreams and shock (sprinkled with a bit of laughs, of course). The characters are well developed and the plot never slows down. This book was very well written."
3,"As a writer and a tough critic, I must say that this story is beautifully-written, informative, and hilarious. Quinn collides reality with humor in this honest, outrageous portrayal of high-brow NYC folks vying for the few coveted spots in the most prestigious private schools. The absurdity is what provides the humor. I mean, we're talking about kindergarten. But the lengths parents will go through to get their kids in would lead one to believe we are talking about medical school. Quinn vulnerably portrays how she, too, can get caught up in the cut-throat world of private school admissions and must make some very difficult ethical decisions. She is human and we love her for it. Laugh, learn, and enjoy the ride in the dog-eat-dog world of kindergarten private schools, where anything, and I mean anything, can happen."
3,"Love this thing, plug it in and in 10 minutes ice is dropping out..you can also set 3 different sizes for the ice. Product worked as described and I am very happy with it!! Buy one and you will love it!"
3,"The quality and value are definitely good. I would like to have an assortment which does not include the classic ""honey and oats"" flavor. These are readily available."
3,"THE MANITOU is a true horror classic that still stands up despite multiple readings and over 25 years of time thanks to Masterton's sense of mood and his wonderful wit. Although the novel is filled with chilling and gory scenes, it's our hero Harry Erskine's terrific charm that keeps us speeding along through the story. Watching as a resurrected medicine man is about to born from the neck of a comatose woman, Harry handles the situation with black humor and an unstoppable drive to see the woman saved. Masterton's original ending (as it was presented in the first edition) is much different and much weaker, included here as a bonus. I hear tell that there's a fourth Manitou novel on the way...following two other sequels REVENGE OF THE MANITOU and BURIAL. I, for one, can't wait!"
3,"As this was the first Maeve Binchy novel I have read, I really have nothing to compare it with therefore I will be unable to rant and rave as to merits, or lack of them, when compared to her previous work. I did enjoy this book. It was light reading and held my interest throughout. I am partial to the area of the world it took place, so I suppose that made it more enjoyable for me. Unlike other reviewers, I thought the story line was reasonable, and for a short work, thought the character developement was pretty well done. I will quite likely read more of her work."
3,"I tried a lot of cameras to get the best balance between ""point and shoot"", portability and above all picture quality. I must say I am proud to have made the best decision here. There are tons of other cameras around and I picked the diamond in the rough. I really like it. I dont have to mess with it much and I dont want to although its got tons of features."
3,"This was a wonderful book, and really taught me some important life lessons. It really makes you think."
3,"This shirt is very nice. I do wish that I had looked for a wrinkle resistant option, but that was my mistake. Came quickly."
3,"Decent quality overall. The toilet seat was broken, but everything else came in good shape. The kitchen furniture just barely fits in the kitchen though. We purchased the Melissa and Dough Victorian dollhouse also. The rest of the furniture fit fine in the house."
3,"Some have taken The Kid's music to heart while others have scoffed at the artist as a novelty retro act. Well, for the record,Kid Creole and The Coconuts are honest to goodness real talented hip and swingin' artists that go way beyond as being seen as a Las Vegas lounge show act. What I admire is their longevity in a music market that just seems to put out or support questionable or talent-challenged artists...This collection of tracks is strongly reminiscent of the big band swinging era of the 1940's and early 50's. Creole's vocals are in top form and give no clue that 20 years have passed since their debut back in the early 80's ! Too Cool To Conga is too cool to keep quiet about..."
3,"I like this product very much. I like the button""Super jump"" very much.It is easy to use. PWE550 is a great dictionary."
3,"Very good product. I use it almost daily now. It is quick an easy to find what ever word you need. Even the crossword finder and anagram have come in handy while writing poetry. I have only a few complaints. A light up screen would be very amazing, and there were a few times where I did not find a word but that's to be expected. That is the only reason it has four stars. Other wise even the light up screen would have gotten it six! Great product HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
3,I like being able to see the out of place eyebrows. Also other facial hair that seem to appear as you get older!
3,"My order came in a timely manor, packaging was solid and installation was a snap. It doesn't feel cheap for the $40.00 I paid. I wish the outer edge design of the 7-X mirror was also on the opposite side. It would have been nice to have it come in additional finishes (pewter, brass, bronze) for the same price."
3,"these mats are cute, easy to clean and durable. I am very staisfied with my purchase of them. No complaints at all."
3,I read this when I was a kid about 25-30 years ago! I loved this story. I still remember it after all these years!
3,I REMEMBER THE PERIOD OF TIME AND LET ME TELL YOU I JUST REALIZED I HAD NO CLUE AS TO WHAT WAS REALLY GOING ON. THIS IS A GREAT CLASSIC
3,"I loved the movie ""All the President's Men"" when I watched it during a journalism class one summer at Northwestern University. But you know how movies are: they're always more exciting, more quick-paced than the books they're based on. Not so in this case. Woodward and Bernstein bring the All the President's Men -- and their interactions with them and with the people who worked for them -- to life in such a way that one needn't have lived through the Watergate era to understand what really happened. All we need to know now is who Deep Throat was!"
3,"Showing the skill and personality which later saw Tom Hanks win many awards, Turner and Hooch is a fun detective/romance romp helped by a remarkable dog. (The dog should have had a special nomination for ""Best Supporting Canine""!)"
3,I'm glad to have this movie in my collection again. I am pleased to say the DVD condition was good and it worked well.
3,Tom Hanks does a great job in this film. I loved the relationship between him and Hooch. This movie makes me laugh every time. Love it.
3,"After wasting 60 dollars on VB.net step by step, I read this book. It's a really good book on ado.net database. Doug lowe and anne prince new book on asp.net will be consider over asp.net step by step by me in future. Authors have done a extremely good job."
3,"I heard ""Tangerine Speedo"" on the local college station and went to painstaking lengths to find this CD locally. It was worth the wait and the effort. My only disappointment is that it didn't come out 3 months earlier so I could've jammed to it all summer in the car with the top down. How fun..... This is the first time in years that a CD in its entirety makes me smile. It's exciting, fun, eccentric and I wouldn't change a thing. Can't wait for them to come to town!!!"
3,"These guys were originally called Fig Dish. Did you ever heard of Fig Dish ? That was the problem. The two albums recorded as Fig Dish (That's What Love Songs Often Do and When Shove Goes Back to Push) contained clever catchy songs but they didn't get much attention. Now they've changed their name to Caviar and they're back with even catchier songs and even more clever lyrics. This is a really fun album that you just have to listen in the summer.There isn't a bad song on here, so I won't detail every one of them. I just want to point out the fun Tangerine Speedo, the energetic Sugarless and the surprisingly beautiful Looked So Hard I Nearly Wrecked My Eyes.Call it catchy power-pop, call it summer music, whatever... Just make sure it comes to you when you do call it."
3,"First hearing Tangerine Speedo on Q101, Chicago, it was awesome. I purchased it for a dollar and a cent, but its definetely worth more than that. It has some great DJ beats, and although they may not be big right now, they're such a great band, they cant stand long without recognition. Seeing them live proved a worthy experience. In Chicago, they are allready big, but I dont think it can be long until every knows this band.Hopefully, your planning on buying this CD. There are songs for every one. Harder rock and softer tones. They mix every popular element of todays music and come out with an original blend. BUY THIS CD!!!PS- Even if you dont like caviar, buy Caviar! get it??? eh eh eh eh eh"
3,"This fun-sounding music has a beat that you are really going to enjoy. From the suggestive-lyrics in Goldmine and Flawed Like a Diamond to the laughable and singable tunes in Tangerine Speedo, there is a bit of something for everybody (except maybe your mother) on here. Definitely a good add for your collection!"
3,"I really like this gate, it is perfect for the size room that I have and it is a neutral color....."
3,"I bought 2 gates to create a 10x12 foot baby-safe area in my open concept living room. It keeps my 12 month old twins in and safe. I can't say it keeps the 3 year old in or out since she learned how to open it within a few minutes. It is perfect for the little ones and the price was right. The only other option for my floor plan would have cost $[...]. I found it really easy to install and put together. The door is a little tricky to close since it has to fit together perfectly before it will latch. Other than that, it is a lifesaver and I no longer have to worry about what the babies are into when I'm out of the room."
3,I bought 2 of these Gates and I love them!!! I have a big space for my little one(1 Jear) in my living room and he loves it!I keep all the toy in there so there is no mess in the rest of the house.Also it is very staedy if put up correct I highly recomend this product !!!!
3,"I know it probably would have demolished the plot, but if it had been me, when I was face-to-face with DuQuesne on the Valeron after Blackie called for a meeting, I would have had several object compasses dialed in on Blackie to keep track of him later.Love the book, too bad Doc didn't write a bunch more Skylark books. It would have been on the shelf next to my Hardy Boys books and my Tom Swift collection."
3,"This is a well written book that gives you a lot of in depth information about Buddhism. I think a beginner should start with Rahula's What the Buddha Taught. After that, this would be a great choice. However, for those who have some knowledge of Buddhism and want to learn more, as they travel on the path, this is a wonderful book. Buy it. You'll like it."
3,"This one was published back in 1955. It is a collection, as indicated by the title, of 1,000 pictures, mostly in black and white of pictures taken from around the United states. The pictures are of course quite dated, and for the most part are the trourist type stuff you use to be able to find in all the gas stations and souvenir shops. I am giving this one four starts simple because it brings back so many memories of our family travels when I was a kid. All of the pictures are well captionsed, if rather vague in nature."
3,"As always with a Tad Williams book you get a lot of distribution so be prepared for environments that are so keenly described you could cut them with a knife.Simon ""Snowlock"" is just starting to come into his own as a great warrior and it is wonderful to watch him and his friends mature and grow as the book goes on. The heroes lose and gain more and more allies as the book goes on(some of these the reader will grow really attached toIf you want a long description of the plot you can read the back of the book and it is a good plot and story that will keep you guessing. However as with all Tad Williams books you must understand that these books are BIG so don't read them if you are one of those people who reads a book and puts it down."
3,"After reading the other review here I had to laugh, it is exactly because of such 'extracts' they posted that I knew I had to read this book! So while they meant it as a criticism, it was pure advertisement for me and I'm so glad they posted it for the book has met all of my expections, James was an incredibly gifted writer and I'm so happy to have 'discovered' him. How glad I am too that he was so prolific!"
3,"This is a well designed wash / bath mitt featuring the popular children's television character Strawberry Shortcake. It fits well and comes with a hook for hanging as well as small loop at the top. It has a lot of nice detailing, including the strawberry ribbon at the top, which is a nice touch. It comes with a tag designating it as authentic Strawberry Shortcake merchandise. It is made of terry cloth and is very soft and comfortable.As for the idea of using this as a gift bag, that seems really more like a marketing gimmick than anything. I don't really know who would give this to their kid filled with candy or something, and then have them turn around and use it for washing."
3,"I buy this book for everyone having a child. My boys had it when they were young over 30 years ago, so that is a lot of distribution. Wonderful read and good for development."
3,Historical Classic. Written by a Biologist who started his academic career in Theology. Its a nice read and you can easily see how he was influenced by the discoveries of the 1800's.
3,"The book came on time and in good condition.My late mother recommended this book. She had read the French version and said it reminded her of life in Quebec City, Canada.The setting is in Montreal. The English version is a bit difficult to read with run-on sentences and few paragraph breaks.I still like it because it makes me feel closer to Mom. I wish I'd thought to find the English version when she was around to answer questions and bring context to the content.I'm only about a quarter of the way through."
3,"much has been said already, so i won't rehash. however, most fans have not paid proper attention to flo's antics on the group introduction on disc 2. this was from the 1967 copa appearance, shortly before flo's ouster. dialogue : flo: that's what you think ( in a high squeaky voice ) diana : that's not your real voice (said in an unsettled and worried tone ) . flo : they don't know the difference ( in a very put on even lower than usual deep voice ) diana : ruuuf, your horrible , god , tsk , well, in the middle is mary wilson . this was not rehearsed. think about it. they would nver rehearse diana calling flo horrible. this passage is an historic demonstration of flo's terrible state of mind and utter frustration at that time that we all know about now. that it was included here in nothing short of amazing.poor flo. can you imagine the chaos that ensued back stage after moments like this ?"
3,Personally this is the best book I've ever read. The use of vocabulary and woringing is excellent! All girls and even boys ages 10-15 should read this funny yet serious book. I think everyone can relate somehow.
3,"Had trouble getting the correct driver. No drivers on the disk for Vista 64-bit laptops. Had to get help from Microsoft and Pharos to get the problem fixed. E-mailed drivers from Pharos come in zipped form and will not open,had to have Pharos send me a disk with an unzipped file. Microsoft had to delete old file drivers from the program to get the new drivers to work."
3,"This book was pretty good, but I think it could have laid back on the details. Overall, though, I think it was an O.K. book. I recommed it for high- school readers."
3,"I can see why some may consider this book to be a jab at capitalism. It definitely doesn't hold back when it comes to demonizing banks and business. If you can set that aside (which I think most people can), this novel is truly one of the greatest American tales of all time. It would take a cold-heart person to not be moved by the story of the Joad family. My favorite Steinbeck was always Of Mice and Men, but THe Grapes of Wrath easily took its place the from the second I finished it. You must read this amazingly well-written novel."
3,"This is a great book. I could hardly put it down.I was supposed to read it in college but somehow couldn't get into it back then. I was looking through some boxes and found the book. I read it every free moment I had. It was hard to get into it at first but after the third chapter I started to get it, then I was hooked. I felt very connected to the Joad family.I was pleased with the book up until the last page. I understood the message but was disapointed in lack of closure with the characters. I truly wanted to know what happened to them.Although it was long I would have been more than happy to read another 600 pages if I thought there would be character closure.I guess the author felt that if people during that time would lose track of their own family members we could sit back and wonder what happened to this family."
3,"The main charachter gets politicized. Great concrete story telling. People you can relate to. A journey that makes sense. And as they go, you learn the situation so far from suburban Overland Park (or wherever you are). The progression of Tom Joad from not involved to opinionated speaking out angry man is well motivated, completely believable."
3,"I've never been so mesmorized by reading fictional prose as I was when I got to the last page of this amazing book. If I hadn't of been sitting down when I read the ending, it might have knocked me down. How affecting can literature be? This book sets a high standard."
3,This is a classic and a must-have must-read for everyone with an interest in good books. This is how you tell a story and make it magical forever and for all to come. Get it now!
3,"I agree with others that the idea of her dressing up and going to a restaurant does get tedious, it needed a little something more. The side stories aren't very involved and don't add much. However, she is a food critic and she writes about the food in such a way that it keeps you captivated in the book. Reichl also places much value in her reviews on the way that people are treated, despite their age or looks, in a restaurant. We find that this is hard to come by in New York. I hope restaurants will learn a little bit about the importance of providing everyone with excellent service. She also includes several recipes in the book that aren't overly complicated, I just bought all the ingredients for a recipe in the book called Aushak that I'm super excited to try!"
3,"I read this book many years ago, and make a point of reading it again at least once a year. Long before tattoos were acceptable for women, I got a crying heart tattoo because of how this book touched my heart."
3,"I've used this lamp a few times now and so far it's been a great headlamp. I really like the green light for temporary use when walking in twilight. Having the top strap really helps stabilize the lamp. The light is not the brightest, but is plenty sufficient."
3,"I really like the original parent trap. The second movie I didn't enjoy nearly as much, but I guess if you can get both for the same price you may as well give it a try."
3,This is a great older movie duo and certainly an asset to my vast collection. Arrived faster than a speeding bullit too!
3,I really like this one. The original is best with the twins being seperated. Another great Disney Movie. I like Haley Mills and she does great playing twins. the way they team up to get their parents back together is great.
3,The original parent trap is a great movie. The bonus second one in this set is awful. Needs to be buried somewhere. If you own the first one don't buy this one for the Parent Trap II.
3,"Our cat has kidney problems and this medicine keeps him feeling fine. It's like a probiotoc that helps the kidneys function and as long as he takes one every day, he seems to have no health problems at all! I truly believe this is a miracle for pets with kidney disease."
3,"Simple to use, fast, and most importantly, consistently great tasting HOT coffee! (of course, the higher the quality of coffee used, the better it tastes) Be aware that when it says it makes up to 4 cups, those are 5 or 6 ounce cups. A few small cons: There's no on/off switch, so the unit starts up right after you plug it into your AC outlet. It may or may not present a slight safety issue....It doesn't have an auto shut-off, so you must remember to unplug it. (I've been very good at that so far!)....There are several pieces to wash. Overall, for the $35 I paid, definitely one of the best items I've purchased of any kind. I just hope it lasts a few years.There aren't too many things as key as starting my day with a good cup of coffee!"
3,"This was a Christmas gift for my father who lives alone. He is very pleased with it, says it cleans easily and makes a great cup of coffee."
3,"GOOD TO DEAL WITH, FAST TURNAROND, PRODUCT AS DESCRIBED . WOULD RECOMMED THEM FOR ANY OTHER TRANSACTIONS. AS I WAS VERY SATISFIED."
3,Farberware is always a reliable coffeepot. No issues with it but I wish it had a clear glass top instead of the black top.
3,I switched from a drip brew coffeemaker to the percolator and have been very pleased with it. The coffee is HOT and delicious. My husband never wants to go back to the old drip brew.
3,bought this a few months ago and it's the best thing i bought to make coffee. i tried the chemex manual coffee maker and it was too much experimenting to get it right. this is perfect and the coffee is great. couldn't ask for anything more
3,"This back to the basics pot makes FANTASTIC coffee! I could have purchased 3 of these for what I paid for my fancy drip coffee maker with all the bells and whistles! The coffee is hot, flavorful and quick! I'll actually drink less coffee now because it's hot enough for me to slowly sip-- not drink down! I was about to be displeased with my new Nissan thermos, but it wasn't the thermos. It can't make something piping hot if it isn't that way when you put it in there! Now if the pot just had the little glass ""thingie"" on top, I'd be transported back to the days of my youth!"
3,"pot is well made. i prefer old style with glass percolater top insert. makes coffee fast and flavorfull. good price. i would prefer american made. repair parts unavailable ,not listed in phone book or online pc"
3,My Wife asked for a percolator for Christmas and so far she loves the coffee it makes. She has for gotten to unplug it a few times but seams safe enough. It is kind of hard to clean out the baked on coffee but it comes apart.
3,I like this product very much because coffee is hot. I like the stainless steel guts and basket. It looks neat and rich on my counter and produces good coffee.
3,"Nice coffee pot, but the stainless steel insert is a little large for the pot. I half to struggle very hard to get the lid off every morning. Could of been designed better.Does make good coffee once you get it apart to get the coffee made."
3,"I love this coffee pot. Really hot coffee and I use less coffee grounds than when I used a drip pot. However, the heating elements burn out too quickly. That's why I bought more than one pot, so I'd have another one one hand. Makes the best coffee ever! Geri"
3,This is a great coffee maker. My friend had one at work and so I had to get one for home. Makes great coffee and is easy to clean.
3,"I was pleased to find this product available for less than the store I found one at. It came promptly and since it was a gift for my mother, I really appreciated it. She had been looking for one since she had such good luck (and good coffee) with her previous one.Thank you"
3,"It makes an OK pot of coffee and does it quickly. I have a little problem reading the measurement marks on the inside, wish it had a clear knob on top to see it percolating and I kind of wish it was insulated so I didn't have to keep it plugged in or transfer the coffee to another pot when done.Let me reiterate... it makes an OK, about mediocre cup of coffee. I've tried a few varieties of StarBucks as well as common brands such as Folgers and Chock Full... It is just OK. I'm not sure if it is better than an ADC maker for the extra effort involved."
3,I have used this size percolator for what seems 100 years and I love it - i also have the 12 cup for when I have company.keep making faberware - SUSAN J. CARAVELLO
3,"If you want a reliable 2 to 4 cup coffee maker that perks a good cup of coffee, consider this one. Although a product of Black and Decker (who makes junk in my opinion) this product meets or exceeds our expectations everyday. And it is used EVERY day."
3,"Old school coffee pot that fast and keeps coffee hot as long as you want. Bought this for my wife you she loves it. Well made and works perfectly. If you want to make great coffee that old school way, this is your pot!"
3,"This album is ecxellent for major relaxation of the mind, body and soul. The best way to let this music evolve and uprise you is by listening to it while going to sleep."
3,"I re-read ""Seven Seasons of Buffy"" in a lull between book deliveries and enjoyed it about as much as last time. It's a collection of essays by sci-fi writers on what was definitely one of the best series on TV IMHO. It leans a little heavy on romance and ""who's Buffy's ideal man"", but is a very good read overall. Intelligent writers, good content.If you liked Buffy you'll love this."
3,"Why read: Received for review.What impressed me: Many authors I had read, or at least heard of, contributed essays to Seven Seasons of Buffy. I didn't agree with everything the essayists put forth, but appreciated the contrasting opinions that made me consider other outlooks. This book is a celebration of everything that Buffy was, but doesn't hold back when presenting theories and ideas that show fans may rabidly disagree with.What disappointed me: With any anthology of this nature, some essays were drier than other and some essayists seemed less familiar with the subject that they should have been. It wasn't perfect, but it was one of the better books that look deeper into Buffy.Recommended: Buffy fans, obviously, but the more fanatical the better."
3,"This book has beautiful photos and describes some tips on what to strive for in various dressage exercises. As a beginner, I am still somewhat in the dark about how to achieve such perfection since the book is not heavy on details of how to use your aids to achieve good results. I am now looking for a book that can be a good supplement to my instructors."
3,"Van Whitfield has written a great romantic - comedybook that keep my interest all the way through.I enjoyed reading Shawn Wayne's point of viewon the dating scene ,what he is looking for andthe situations he had to go through to get them.This book will have you laughing from beginningto end but expect some surprises along the way.Both men and women should read this book sowe can understand each other in the dating arena.V.W. keep the books coming !!!"
3,"After reading some of the negative reviews of this book, I was kind of hesitant to buy it, but it sounded like an interesting story, so I gave it a try. I am so glad I did! I thought Shawn's story of his quest for his #6 was hilarious. Shawn was incredibly stupid, but he was a sweet, sincere guy. It was refreshing to read about a young black man who was looking for a healthy relationship with a woman, instead of the usual mack daddy images that are in many of our books and movies. I was very happy for Shawn when he finally found his #6 (Troi had me fooled too). I hope that Troi's ""good news"" doesn't destroy his relationship with Dawn. Perhaps Van will write a sequel to let us know how it all works out for Shawn."
3,I have really enjoyed this book. She is very clear and factual! It is great to get the facts without a feminist twist to it!
3,Satisfied because I learned through this book for my class. Would recommend for beginners and students who are taking a pre-calculus class.
3,"They're getting better with age! I own all of the Guest films starting with Spinal Tap and I loved For Your Consideration as much as all the other films. I am surprised at all the ""disappointed"" reviews. But I suppose that comes with such high expectations. Guest, Levy, O'Hara, McKean and the gang have set an extremely high bar for themselves. If anything, they have become so skilled at complete character embodiment that this film is not only hilarious is more 'human' than all the others. There is pathos and poignancy here and even (gasp) drama! It is the most subtle of Guest's comedies....but it is still most definitely a comedy. If the negative reviews having you questioning whether or not you will enjoy this film...let me remind you of the very first time you ever watched a Guest/Levy film. Try not to go in with the bias of having loved all his other films. The talent and humor are here for your consideration."
3,"This cookbook was exactly what I was looking for. Simple recipes, clear instructions, tasty food. The only downfall I had was finding a few of the ingredients. Most of the flours and starches are available at a number of local grocery stores. But others I had to find online and didn't offer items in smaller quantities for trial purposes."
3,"These window panels look very nice, and are well-made. Only problem I have is that the 86"" panels are barely 85"" long, including the tab tops. Once hung on the rod, which spreads the tab out some, they're closer to 84"" long. I was really hoping they'd be the full 86"", but they will still work, just glad I didn't install the rods without measuring first."
3,"This book is for those who respond to positive suggestions and are open to New Age philosophy with just as much affirmation of faith in a deity. The suggestion is to read the affirmations and its analysis, sit with it for a time each day, with the promise that at the end of 40 days something will have shifted in the reader's thinking.I believe that this method is worth pursuing and have found it beneficial in improving my perceptions of how I see the world, how I nurture my relationships, in how I regard myself.After reading it the first time I've decided to give it another round to reinforce its upbeat message."
3,"This is the best introduction into speech sciences for linguistic students, especially for phoneticians. I wish I had such a book when I first struggled with technical writings on speech processing. Material is organized perfectly, style is clear, easy read. after reading this book it is possible to take amore advanced and more technical ones, e.g. by Jurafsky and Martin. Students who feel overt to math enjoyed the curse based on this book and joyfully played with C programs to modify the results. No woner if the book becomes a compulsory textbook for an introductory course on computational linguistics or speech processing at linguistic departments. I feel obliged to the author for the book. It is not a 5-star rating, of course, it is definitely higher. Many thanks to the publisher for evaluation copy."
3,"This has to be about the most useful little tool set to have. I bought one to keep in the saddle bag of my motorcycle ""just in case"". It works great as an addition to the factory-supplied tool set that comes with a new motorcycle or as a basic set of tools to have in case the other set gets lost."
3,"I tell everyone I talk to who has sciatic nerve problem or metatarcil problems that these orthotics are incredible, and much, much better than the ones I paid $500 for at the Good Feet store. I had an orthopedic doctor who was going to cut the nerve between my toes to eliminate my excruciating pain, but luckily I tried these first. I have very high arches and they weren't getting enough support. Anyway, yes, I do take all the inner soles and arch supports out of every shoe I buy and I put another flat rubbery sole on top of the walk-fits and I walk in heaven. I can carry my grand kids, and heavy groceries up my steps without pain. Spent a fortune on Dr. Scholles and it was all a waste of money."
3,"I really like this headlamp. It's well-made and powerful. I had intended it for hiking and for occasional use around the yard at night. But I have found that it's excellent for all inside home repair work. Working under a sink, for instance. No need to hold a flashlight or set up a lamp. I've used other headlamps for home and auto work but the brightness and endurance of this one make it a better experience."
3,"I love this light, it is great for duck and deer hunting. It has 3 different settings but really, the low setting is plenty good. I also use it for safety when taking walks at night."
3,please send me i need it for my final exam on my personality development subject. thank you
3,"I read this book because Jess Willard Speer, known as Tag to all of the family and close friends was my great-uncle that always enthralled me when we would sit in family gatherings and listen to his stories of life's experiences. I was overwhelmed at not only how much I found out from a genealogical perspective, that I somehow hadn't known before, but also by the grip this book got on me and my husband as well. We did not want to stop reading it outloud to one another! My father-in-law who never had the opportunity to meet any of my family loved the book and also could not put it down like ourselves. I had read The Grapes of Wrath when in high school years ago - it didn't grab me like this one did. A definite ""must read"" for anyone who likes history or just likes a great read!"
3,"I had a nagging and peculiar performance problem with a specific query involving a quirk in the Oracle optimizer which I had been trying to solve on and off for months. With the help of this book, I resolved the problem. It has a level of detail in query optimization way beyond other ""highly recommended"" books. The explanations are clear, *complete* (completeness was lacking in the other books), and easy and enjoyable to read. I finally have the understanding of these Oracle internals that I have been seeking!"
3,Love Marshall Rosenberg's nonviolent communication skills & classes. This book really helps in understanding how to communicate gracefully and not confrontational
3,"Very enlightening and has dramatically improved my marriage, work and family relationships. I gave a copy to my family members, I'm sure they'll love it too! This will be a book I will reread many times in my life :-)"
3,"Some of it I've read elsewhere, but there's more depth and detail here than I've found elsewhere. There are some places where I could use more information, but one book can't do everything. I'm looking forward to our church's workshops on NVC in the fall."
3,This book helped me see that judging and blaming is not a recipe for happiness. An open exchange of feelings and needs is. This book could help nearly all humans find the peace to stay compassionate in the most trying of circumstances by changing the way we hear words. Insults aren't insults. They are a way people communicate needs when they are highly disconnected from their feelings. I found this book to be very beautiful and I would hope everyone gets a chance to read it.
3,"With out a doubt the best and handiest tool I ever purchased. It leaves your hands free to work, and no more trying to hold a flashlight and work with one hand. Evey one needs one around the house!"
3,"If you're not careful taking it off or putting it on, then the clips will slide such that the waist straps will become unadjusted. A bit bulky size wise, but it did well on a trip to Disney World."
3,"one of the three books that any student or writer of poetry needs to own, besides a good dictionary. (The other two are Pound's ""ABCs of Reading"" and Shapiro's ""Primer."") Answers questions & points you in the right direction for more. Once you open it, you'll wonder how you got by without it."
3,This Cha-Cha time capsule is full of stars and 60's humor. I wish I could turn back the clock.
3,"We have had a copy with the original art work which we prefer, but this story is so much fun to read with kids of different ages. They love the cadence and refrain of the story so much."
3,"I bought this to replace my old well-used armoured lock. The Rottweiler 5024 is thicker and longer (it looks much more modest on the product image, where it is scaled to the same size as their shorter models) and probably better suited to secure motorcycles than bicycles, which is what I use it for. If it were a foot shorter (and correspondingly lighter) it would be perfect for me. I got used to it though. The extra length can be useful when securing both frame and a tyre to, for instance, a bulky pole or a tree. Did I mention that it's heavy? 3.5lb."
3,I was very suprised to recieve this hat! it is stunning for a dress up hat! my son will be able to play with this for quite awhile. it even has a size adjuster in it!
3,"My son is 5. He and his cousin each received these hats. His cousin is also 5. The quality is pretty ok. The only negative is the shape of the hat. The one pictured is basically perfect, while the two we received have a bit of an unusual fit. But, the kids seem to enjoy them, and most of the adults that have seen them made comments about them being pretty cool.We paid $19 for each hat. I would say $13 would be more appropriate."
3,A wonderful book! My one yr old hands me this all the time- she loves it. A very fun Halloween themed book that can be read all year long!
3,I received this overnight with 2 Day Shipping. Bought as GoldBox deal and am very satisfied. Too bad Gold Box doesn't allow you to order more than one item.
3,This plant stand is nice and it is sturdy but it is very small. It will only hold a plant that is in a small pot and on a short hanger.
3,"This may be the most unique movie that I've seen in the last decade or more. Very philosophical, yet violent, and funny. It's not perfect but I give it credit for being very unique."
3,"I recently ordered this CD along with another by Shastro. He is known for his new age music(e.g. Shambala) but this is a little different. It has a distinctly Latin flavor, and I really like it. If you enjoy smooth jazz, Latin music, and new age, then this will be perfect. There's not a bad cut on the disc."
3,"This is a quaint, old book, well-written, but with the same style and archetypes as Alger's many other works. Still, it provides an interesting look into America before the turn of the 20th Century, and makes a good book to read by the fireplace."
3,"These beans have a good flavor and texture: the southwestern spices are subtle, but present. I like to jazz the beans up, but this isn't necessary. Add the product to boiling water and it's ready; I don't think there is a need to let it simmer for five minutes (if you're impatient like me)."
3,These beans have such a great flavor. They are easy to cook. I like these beans better than any of the canned refired beans I've tried. I recommend the beans to everyone.
3,"Really, they are great.Good flavor and texture, and they are fast to make, what more could you want?"
3,"These are the best refried beans available. I will never buy canned again. My husband never used to like beans when I made homemade burritos..he would only eat the meat. Now, he eats beans and meat. I've passed bags out to all of my friends and they all love them too."
3,"Graham contacted me on ""Myspace"" based on my music preferences - I'm glad that he did, because I think that he's pretty good. If you go out to his myspace page you can listen to a few of his songs to decide whether or not you want to buy the album"
3,"I would love it if it was a little more usable. This is one of the few books I've bought that I can't do the side by side page view. However, I do like it becuase it was cheaper than buying the textbook from the bookstore here on campus."
3,"perhaps best studio album...along with Shakedown, American Beauty and some say Anthem...maybe Workingmans comes close. Actually Touch of Grey is their truly best studio but that is a different era."
3,The Winchester Wildcat 22 LR model has a narrow dove-tail scope mounting grove. These work but are not inexpensive like most dove-tail mounts.......but save yourself aggravation and money and get the Millet's on the front end.
3,McGahan involves young people in the reality of colonial life in an intriguing way. Raid at Red Mill is a gripping tale of adventure. It leaves the reader with an eagerness to know more about the early days of our country.
3,"This is one of the most incredible works on epistemology ever written! Finding the indigenous undercurrents of European civilization, Duerr inspires us to discover our own lycanthropic potential. This is literally a life-changing book. Anyone interested in paganism, psychedelics, enchantment, and protean lyncanthropy should plunge into this book like the lifegiving wellspring it is! This book should continuously be in print, and should inspire sequels as well. There is nothing like this book anywhere. Everyone should read this incredible work of scholarship and synthesis."
3,"I am a big Steinbeck fan and have read most of his books. I like them all, but this one is a very gripping tale about farm labor and unions in the California central valley. It is a very moving book."
3,"I guess this is a new issue of the original book with a new cover to plug the movie. I see from IMDB that it will be staring Matthew McConaughey and Marisa Tomei, who are both excellent actors and beautiful people. The book itself is not quite as dark as much of Connelly's work, which is good, and has a bit more of a twist in the plot than his usual mysteries, with his primary character experiencing even more torment than usual for MC.The story does start off a bit slow, and you are nearly halfway through the book before Connelly starts to twist your intestines and get you thoroughly involved in the story. Stick with it - it's one of his best. And that says a lot."
3,"This is the first Michael Connelly book I have read. I really enjoyed it, and look forward to reading more of his books. The characters are easy to follow and to like. The ending was a surprise that I didn't see coming."
3,Thank you for an excellent read Michael....I enjoyed your characters and their flaws. Your book kept me up nights...
3,"As this book has been extensively reviewed, I will be brief. Connelly is obviously a well known author and sometimes I have found that well known authors sell more based on their name (and just rehashing the same old stuff) than by originality. This author, however, knows how to keep it fresh. That's why I appreciated the Lincoln Lawyer. It's a great legal thriller and though Connelly is not a lawyer, he does a great job keeping you going in this book. Two thumbs up from me!"
3,This was a great story! I finished the book hoping for more Mick Haller! Great suspense and will be reading more Michael Connelly books!
3,I love Cinnamon Altoids and this is the best price I have found...anywhere!! I keep coming back again and again.
3,"Since we go through quite a few of these, it was prudent to purchase in bulk (plus cinnamon is mostly better than the mint ones). Great price!"
3,"I must listen to this album everyday, this is where I get my inspiration. I've loved Nancy since I was little and she inspired me to play guitar. Not only does she play like an angel, but she sings like one also. I'm in absolute awe of her, and she should definitely get more credit for her exceptional talent. Her talent is a blessing, and I'm so happy she made this album, it was long overdue. Good things come to those who wait!!! I was hoping for a video but this will definitely do!!NANCY RULES!!!"
3,"Nancy was always the sister in Heart I liked the most. She writes and plays with what is obviously a pre and tender soul. Songs like The rain Song and Love Mistake are evidence enough of this. She is not just the gorgeous wife of Cameron Crowe, but a majorly talented writer, singer and consummate guitarist"

3,"Don't get me wrong, I adore Beth Orton, I have all of her albums as well as her ""Pass in Time"" collection. I listen to them all, particularly the two-CD ""Pass in Time"" collection on a regular basis, which might explain why I find Jem to be such a wonderful sound.Dark, hazy, gauzy, and yet fairy beat-driven and somewhat trip-hoppy in sound, this CD is a wonderful listen from beginning to end. The marriage of the music and Jem's voice produces a very solid first solo effort. ""They"", ""Finally Woken"", ""Come On Close"", ""Save Me"", and ""Wish I"" are standouts for me. There are various influences here from electronic to reggae, yet the entire album flows and feels cohesive.Also check out Jem's song ""Amazing Life"" on the Six Feet Under ""Everything Ends"" soundtrack.I look forward to all future efforts from Jem."
3,Like her name implies her album is something special. I stumbled upon this album by accident while looking at another album. After hearing the first four songs I was hooked! From the smooth and mellow title song Finally Woken to the reggae like sound of Save Me this album has it all. I think my favorite would be 24 which is a hard hitting rocking delight. Her voice is smooth her music eclectic ... and all come together in a wonderful mix. One of the best kept secret of the year.
3,"He leido el libro 3 veces en espanol, y lo lei en ingles a principios de este ano. No me gusto en ingles pues pierde mucha de la magia que solo el idioma espanol puede expresar. Leer las novelas de GGM es adictivo. Nunca cansan. Hasta ahora no he leido ninguna que no me haya gustado."
3,It is a pleasure to have a good source for reading Hispanic literature in its original form and language. I highly recommend this version of the Garcia Marquez classic.
3,"Es como cualquier otra lectura, varias personas te la podran recomendar,pero esta en uno abrir el libro, comenzar a leer y despues imaginarse que uno esta viendo la historia o fantasia, inclusive tome el papel que mas a uno le guste."
3,"I'm not the smartest man on the block, but I consider myself to be fairly well-read. Usually, when I finish a novel I think about it for a brief while and then look for my next book to read.CIEN ANOS DE SOLEDAD was a novel that when I finished reading it (I read it in Spanish) I automatically began with page one.It is one of the most enthralling, awe-inspiring novels that I've ever read. Garcia MÃ¡rquez es un genio.READ THIS NOVEL! (You may even want to read it twice).(Leete esta novela, que bien vale la pena. Es impresionante e inolvidable.)"
3,"Gabriel Garcia Marques' best work. Romance, history, and fantasy combined. A must have."
3,"No digo que la literatura colombiana sea mala al poner 4 estrellas ya que me gusto el libro, pero como estudiante, definitivamente una lectura pesada, un poco complicada y definitivamente tediosa. Es un buen libro, el contenido es asombroso, pero si no estan dispuestos a leer las 500 paginas, no lo compren porque eso es exactemente lo que uno tiene que hacer para llegar a un final que te deja suspirando."
3,I was looking for a great illustrated coffee table book and I found it right here! All the pictures are black-and-white and beautiful!
3,I AM A BIG FAN OF JOHNNY CASH AND JUNE CARTER CASH. RECENTLY ON PBS I SAW A BIO OF THE CARTER FAMILY. IT MADE ME ENJOY THIS CD EVEN MORE THAN EVER. I THINK THIS IS A GREAT SELECTION OF MUSIC! I RATE IT 5 STARS
3,"I found this book to be very useful to me. The author presents a positive, upbeat prespective of the oppurtunities and challenges presented by the Internet."
3,This is a fun movie to watch. Visual graphics are great and there are some very amusing and funny scenes.
3,"Little DJ has suspicions about the house across the street and the cranky old man who lives there. When the old man has a heart attack and is carried away by an ambulance, DJ thinks the danger is over. Unfortunately, as he, his friend Chowder, and a candy-selling prep-school girl named Jenny discover, the house itself has plans, plans that include eating all the kids who'll be trick-or-treating that Halloween night. The best part of the movie definitely has to be the characters. Each were extremely well thought out and put together. They did a fantastic job of matching right voices with the right characters. Characters facial expressions were amazing. You'll find yourself laughing at things they say and do quite a lot. If you are looking for a fun, clean movie with plenty of laughs, this is definitely one you don't want to miss."
3,"Loved this movie and can definitely see why it was nominated for an Oscar for Best Animation! I honestly thought it should have won for Best Animation, but oh well!!This movie has a great storyline, is fast paced and entertaining to say the least. I think it may be fairly scary for those under 7 years old though, but otherwise a great film."
3,"This is a cute, smart, and entertaining animated movie. It's good for adults as well as kids, although not really young kids. The animation is very life-like. Definitely worth seeing."
3,"This book brought a realization to me. It touched my Heart to see how megan coped with her disability. It teaches a great life's lesson, about accepting who you are. It shows you just how hard a diability is. Unlike movies, where everything is perfect in a disabled person's life. That's just not how it is. Harris shows that it doesn't matter that a person is disabled they're still people. All the people in this heart warming story will teach you things you never thought of before, or have and have forgotten. This book will warm your heart and bring a smile to your face."
3,"Personally, I don't find this to be anything special. But, it's a very afordable product, which probably is what appeals to most people out there. Again, nothing special. Sigh."
3,"Three CDs on in her haphazard solo career, Amy Rigby seems as unlikely to make a bad record as she does to make a successful one. Her roots rock anchors whatever makeshift band she's fronting, but it's her basic honesty as a woman and a writer that limits her commercial scope. Just this much cheese on The Sugar Tree and she'd write a hit for herself or more likely another shallower singer (Mary Chapin Carpenter, anyone?). Rigby must be dairy intolerant, `cause cheese ain't nowhere to be found in her tough, funny, achingly honest songs of the struggles of lower-middle-class single mothers, their man troubles, and their brief, bittersweet respites. The Diary of a Mod Housewife is first and freshest, Middlescence more desperate about the cash crunch, but it's The Sugar Tree that's her finest moment so far. Though money troubles and age are her great subjects, I wish her success enough to stop shopping at Goodwill. I mean, look, she's still going to get older!"
3,"""What About Me?"" is an excellent book for children. It teaches them important life skills that are so crucial and the illustrations are simply beautiful. This book is a wonderful way to address sibling rivalry - Great for the entire family.Mom Writer's Talk Radio www.momwriterstalkradio.com"
3,I have a 7 month old and he loves being in it. Would definitely recommend this to any moms who are shopping around for a baby carrier!
3,"With epic love stories being such the rage in film these last few years (e.g. ""Braveheart,"" ""The English Patient,"" ""Titanic""), I'm surprised I haven't heard more about the best one ever. From the first visit of Cathy's ghost (could you ever forget Olivier's voice crying out to her over the storm?) to the last glimpse of the ghosts climbing Penistone Crag, this film takes hold of you and doesn't let go. It's passionate, breathtaking, and utterly unforgettable. Olivier and Oberon are perfect, Wyler's directing is faultless, and the script is masterful. The music by Alfred Newman is also praiseworthy. While other versions may be more ""faithful"" to the book (one of my personal favorites, incidentally), they fail to capture its intensity and inner reality. But this isn't a film simply for the literary: my brother, who read the book for a college course and hated it, liked this film."
3,Just as advertised. Works great. Had no problems what-so-ever. Added another hard drive to my computer with these and after several months everything is still working.
3,"My granddaughter enjoyed this book so much, that we have it out more than the Library has it in stock. One of the librairians is a neighbor and we had been to the library that day and we searched high and low for this book, to no avail. That evening the neighbor came with book in hand, and my 2 1/2yr old granddaughter was so excited to get her book back, she claims. She can't read but knows it by heart."
3,"I bought this for my kids but ended up listening to it over and over. Ted Jacob's is an amazing musician who surrounds himself with equally talented people. Great melodies beautifully arranged. This is a unique, totally original collection."
3,THIS SONG IS THE BEST SONG To DANCE TO. HERE IN BRAZIL EVERYBODY RUNS TO DANCE TO THIS SONG. THIS SONG IS DEFFINATELY CHERS GREATEST
3,The new sounds and good beat keep you really interested. She souns like she has come alive again and is glad about it.
3,"I am not a big Country fan....but I love this man's voice. I remember when I was much younger hearing his songs, especially America The Beautiful and it stuck with me, it seems like forever. What a shame this man passed on without much hoopla. Truly a great American. Thanks Charlie."
3,"I can't believe there's any problem with this funny, smart , and warm book ! On the last page, we meet the brother of The Boy Who Looked Like Lincoln--his name is Dickie and he looks just like Dick Nixon. He even has a TAPE RECORDER and is making two V's for Victory! Anyone who interprets ""Dickie"" in another way has no sense of history and a VERY DIRTY MIND."
3,"Even at the lowest volume level, my Shure E4C earphones are too loud for me when I am listening to music in quiet environments. This level attenuator does an excellent job of decreasing the volume. No static is heard when adjusting the volume. Also, the volume between the two earphones remains balanced at even the lowest levels.The instructions state that this is intended for use on airplanes only but I have not had any problems using this with my iPod nano."
3,"This is an outstanding personal story of one who was trained and fought in the P 51 Mustang, one of the most popular and outstanding airplanes of WW II."
3,"I bought this expecting some kind of basic book on bipolar but it is so much more. The mood charts & advice on medicines and natural health are something I should have had years ago. Left me asking why I had to buy a book to find out these things, and thinking about buying another copy for my doctor."
3,"I was first drawn into the book ""The Education of Henry Adams"" when Henry Adams wrote how he was led to ""... more than once to sit at sunset on the steps of the Church of Santa Maria di Ara Coeli..."" (page 91) Adams wanted to teach people how we can teach ourselves. He wanted to say that knowledge devoid of feeling is of little use and meaning. He said, towards the end of the book and towards the end of his life, ""All the teacher could hope was to teach it reaction."" Despite his willful, self-imposed criticism of his own inadequacies and failures, he succeeded brilliantly in teaching us how to achieve our own personal Annunciation, as he obviously experienced his, at sunset on the steps of the Church of Santa Maria di Ara Coeli."
3,"I first read Ellmann's ""Oscar Wilde"" shortly after it was published more than twenty years ago. Reading it again has proved even more a pleasure. Not only is this the definitive biography of Wilde, it is the definitive literary biography of anyone. Ellmann's deep understanding of Wilde and his ability re-create the times Wilde lived in renders passages that are often breathtaking. To be reading about the writing of ""De Profundis"" and ""The Ballad of Reading Gaol"" on the same day that a judge struck down Proposition 8 made me think about how Wilde would have been regarded had he only lived twenty or thirty more years. A hundred and ten years after his death, he is even more relevant in so many ways. This book is beautiful, from the writing to the type to the binding. You can say of Wilde, Ellmann, the book itself: they don't make 'em like this anymore. Perhaps one of my ten favorite books ever."
3,Believe the reviews--this book cannot be overrated. It is far and away the best book ever written on playing the hand at bridge. It is encyclopedic and appropriate for experienced and novice players alike.
3,Very approachable yet comprehensive guide to play of the hand by declarer. Excellent for the novice player with progressive extensions into more advanced play. This book is still highly relevant despite being last revised in 1958. I'd give it 6 stars if I could!
3,"I can't say enough good things about this book. I picked it up from my library a few weeks ago and ended up buying it because I think it will be such a good reference book for me in the future.The number one thing that sets this book apart from the other running books I've seen out there is that it's written by a woman for women. Kowalchik knows what she's talking about, and she's been there. She includes chapters on safety, nutrition, running through pregnancy or menopause, and what to wear in any season. She also includes the training schedules she used to get ready for 5Ks, 10Ks, halfs and marathons. The graphs and information in this book makes it worth the buy."
3,"I have allways liked all projects that Snowy Shaw has been inwolved in. But this beats them all... This is hard, scary, Transylvanian metal.Mix Dummu Borgir, The Project Hate, Cradle of Filth and King Diamond and you have it. Outstanding druming as usuall by Snowy...Also buy 'Illwill'!!"
3,This book is wonderfull. Full of great tips for anyone selling thier home or just looking for inexpensive ways do update the home they want to stay in!
3,"I am still in the middle of reading Adam Bede. So far, it is a very interestin' book by George Eliot; not her best; it it her first novel; but interestin', just the same. Thee likes 'he book."
3,"This book is awesome, and the illustrations are amazing. I can't seem to find more information about the illustrator though. Does anyone have any idea where I can find more information about him or his work?"
3,"I've tried all the rest...finally found the best!Thick, sturdy and ABSORBENT pads. They do notneed to be changed constantly!"
3,"Outstanding lead vocals with crucial lyrics, proverbial like Marley, IV's, and Gladiators. Harmonies and bass guitar are well up in the mix, as they should be, and their lines are superb. Chilled out production, with nice keys and horns. This recording is so full of life... collect it."
3,"First of all, let me just say that I'm been an Anita Baker fan since she first came on the scene. Her sultry, almost drunk with emotion style of singing took me off my feet. So I was amazed to hear that she would try compete with her own past after going out on the top. I am floored that this CD is soooo good. Most people can't take such a long break and come back like this. I'm am so moved by this artistry and her voice is even better. Anita Baker is not just a songtress, but a soultress. Thank You Mrs. Baker. You are the pioneer of Neo-Soul before there was even such a thing. You are not singing the Blues, Jazz, or even R&B, but if you could create a sound for the word soul-it would be your voice. A must have for every music lover and couple."
3,"I've been a fan of Ms. Anita Baker since her Songstress debut and it has just gotten better and better with each album. Her latest, 'My Everything,' is just a testament to this lady's impeccable knack for wrapping herself around a song and delivering it in the Anita way, no matter how long it has been since she recorded. 'My Everything' is like having warm peach cobbler topped with Vanilla Bean ice cream when you've had nothing but tofu bars for the last eighteen months. It is decadent and filling, without being overly rich, all at the same time. The music industry has far too long been inflated with Beyonce and Ashanti derivatives; I am glad that Ms. Baker felt obliged to grace us once again with her voice. If you like good music, this album is a must buy!"
3,"This series was unique in its dark nature. I kept saying, ""Any normal human would be driven nuts by now"". But I devoured the series. I couldn't put it down. The ""tolerence"" message was just a smidge heavy handed, giving it 4 instead of 5 stars. I bought in totally to the world and I was both comforted and disturbed. The series reminds me of early Hienlein in nature but rougher. I appreciate the challenges of the Navy more now, and that has influenced how I read other books about Navy characters. There is a story here, not just hack and slash."
3,Optometrist has changed my prescription because my eyesight has improved with regular use of this herb combination. I'm definitely a believer now!
3,"I bought this during the recent Amazon Toys Sale. The car requires 8 D batteries to operate and 3 AA batteries for the bubble generator in the back. The button to operate the car and the bubble generator is on the right handle bar (throttle) and situate back far enough so if the child just want to push the car manually, it doesn't get push accidentally. The button is sensitive enough so that the 2 years old little finger can operate the car with a slight push. It takes a little while for the bubble to come out, so the child have to travel a distance of couple feet before seeing the bubbles. Overall, my 2 years old enjoy her car a lot for a past few days"
3,"The Edible Woman was a genuine, outstanding book to read. It was rich with irony and metaphors. I couldn't put it down. It made me think about how society can have such an affect on an individual. It made me realize that in a way that is happening to me and everyone. In the book, Marian wasn't able to eat. She was like being ""consumed"" by society."
3,This is a great Bob Seger collection that you must have along with the first volume. Be sure to get both.
3,"The HONEYWELL HFD-130 ,works well. IT CLEANS THE AIR as advertised and the filter is easy to clean, the gauge on top is a usefull tool . The down side is , the fan noise, other than low is to loud at night to sleep through . even across the room.To some people its proably ok , I just dont like that type of sound when sleeping. Other than that a good product, at a good price."
3,This pair of Cardinal salt & pepper shakers work great - nice size for the table - Quality pieces. Guests really like using them.
3,"Deenie was a very good book.Her mother wants her to become a model,but Deenie doesn't care much about modeling.Her situation puts her in a tight spot but she fights through it and tries to act like a normal girl although she has what is called adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.Her doctors make her wear a brace that makes her struggle to just be a normal girl.Although she is unhappy she makes it through school and her tough life with a brace.At the end she finally realizes that her situation does not keep her from being a normal girl."
3,This book is my favorite book. I like the way that Judy Blume writes books that I can relate to. I think that all girls should read this book. It has given me insperation for life.
3,"Can't complain about the product. It's an unfinished aluminum tube. The ends are rough so I'm guessing that means it was cut from a longer tube. The product I got was 1/8"" longer than 24"".My main problem with what I order was that the product name and the product specifications DO NOT MATCH. The name shows 3/8"" OD (outer diameter), however, the product specifications show 5/8"" outer diameter. So if you're looking for a 5/8"" outer diameter aluminum tube, this IS THE WRONG PRODUCT. I ended up having to reorder the Aluminum 2024-T3 Seamless Round Tubing, WW-T 700/3, 5/8"" OD, 0.555"" ID, 0.035"" Wall, 24"" Length. Note that the 2024-T3 is the finished aluminum tube. I couldn't find a 6061-T6 aluminum tube with a 0.035"" wall."
3,"This book presents the various arrythmias in a very good format. From atrial to junctional rhythms, her explanations and diagrams are very helpful and informative.My only complaint, and why I didn't give it 5 stars, is that I wish she would have put some sort of cardiac pharmacology table in with the text (i.e. what drugs are indicated for the various dysrhythmias)."
3,"This pastry brush is the perfect size -- not too long and has a well-designed handle. I bought two! Unlike fiber pastry brushes, no stray fibers wind up in what you're cooking!"
3,"What I enjoyed most about this book was the sense of wonder with which Mike approaches North Carolina. Some guidebooks are like traveling with a jaded, smug know-it-all. I know the latter has some snob appeal for some people, but that's not where Mike's coming from. Reading his book is like traveling beside a more seasoned traveler who knows the destination well, and is excited to show you how special it is, as well as WHY it's special (for instance, James K. Polk was mostly a name from US History class until I read Mike's sidebar on him. Now I'm interested in this NC native.)"
3,"I bought a Giro Flume Youth helmet for my 3-year-old son (now almost 5; helmet fit is still comfortable and safe), in the red flame pattern. My husband is a somewhat serious mountain biker, who wanted a very safe helmet for our child; and my son is a very sensitive little guy (he hates crooked sock seams, grit on his skin, hats, etc.). I myself wanted something my little guy thought looked cool but that didn't have superheroes or advertising on it :) This helmet made everybody happy. Of course it is mandatory that our child wear it for biking; but the requirement hasn't been onerous, my son is happy to wear it on his cycle and often leaves it on for fun. The fit is adjustable, and (unlike some other helmets we've seen) is very comfortable even when snug enough to be safe and not to slip around. I highly recommend it and am back to buy a second to have on hand for visiting kids."
3,This doll was only $3... for that much money you can not expect any better. I would say the doll is worth that price easily or more. It's a small doll (which is what we were after for our 2 year old. It does look like a wrinkly little newborn... alien square head and all haha! It would be nice if you could find an outfit or two for a doll this size for an older child. That is my only real complaint.
3,The stories(more like poems) inside are perfect for bedtime.They hold my 10 month old son's attention.
3,"I appreciate that it's narrated by children, as it makes it more appealing to others of that age group. I think it's a great way for children to learn more about Cuba outside of the normal curricula."
3,"After seeing all the ""hype"" about this guy, i was expecting the worst....all the talk of ""next big thing"" and ""the new springsteen"" had me set to bash pete yorn...but i gotta hand it to the guy...the record is absolutely beautiful. A perfect balance of subtlety and raw emotion rolled into one. I wouldn't go as far as to call him the ""new Springsteen"", (although he did rock on the Tonight Show) but this record is definately a great start towards a very promising career. Well done."
3,"This is a realy good c.d.,in fact one of the best I'v purchased in awhile.And Pete Yorn's voice reminds of Eddie Vedder (if you don't know that is it's the singer of Pearl Jam,and if you don't know who Pearl Jam is your lost and beyond help) wich is a realy good thing. Musicforthemorningafter is a good c.d. and fans of all types of rock should like it. I listen bands ranging from Pearl Jam,System of a Down,Smashing Pumpkins,Blink 182,Factory 81,The Deadlights,and 311 and many more and this c.d. is just all out good. All of the songs are realy well writen. Some realy good ones are Life on a Chain,Strange Condition,and EZ and basicly every track. This is a soft c.d. but don't let it fool you if you don't like soft rock it's still realy good so seriously just check this c.d. out."
3,"The amazing Cyndi shines in this eclectic collection of standards. Her imaginative and understated approach combined with her talent for imbuing songs with rich emotion makes each of these well known standard a delight to rediscover. And her ability to shift gears is amazing, from her gospel-soul vocals on the title track At Last, to the somber, achingly beautiful delivery of Walk On By, to the Afro-Cuban liveliness of her infectious vocals on Stay. The amazing Ms. Lauper proves that she can not only sing all types of music but she does so with exceptional skill and style. This is truly a collection of songs to cherish and this album should garner Cyndi the attention and respect she so richly deserves."
3,"Cyndi shows us a vocal ability that's nothing short of phenomenal, with an album that fits her to a ""T."" She expressives herself so well on a range of covers, running the gamut from the Righteous Brothers, to Bacharach, Piaf, The Animals, Nina Simone and Louis Armstrong. The opening title track, is her interpretation of 60's jazz Great Etta James's signature song. Cyndi nails this one, and the other 9 songs she put together and produced w/Russ Titleman. You may recognize his other work - producing for Eric Clapton, among others. Let's face it, Cyndi Lauper has been so unfairly labeled over the last 20 years - much of those years only getting recognized for her 80's work. It is a travesty, because she deserves so much more credit than that. The 80's are long gone. Some of you need to wake up and just give this one a try. You'll be glad you did."
3,"The remakes are first rate. Cyndi even lets the flaws in her voice show through on some of the songs, like on La Vie En Rose, where her voice cracks during the last verse, because of the emotion she's feeling. A real singer isn't afraid to do that. Cyndi's at that point now in her career where her record company(Sony), is giving her complete artistic freedom on her records. They know they are dealing with a great talent, who needs to express herself. The proof is in the emotion and honesty she puts forth on every song. She has a voice that equals the talent of Billie Holiday and Patsy Cline, combining vocal power with sensitivity. I enjoyed this record thoroughly."
3,"I have been a fan of Cyndi Laupers as far back as ""Girls Just Want to Have Fun"" and have seen her in concert twice, once with Cher and once as the headliner. Both concerts were great - what a great voice! However, I would have liked a CD with original work and not covers. Especially, since a long absence. None the less, the more I listen to ""At Last"", the more I like it. She signs the old songs like they are hers. Again, welcome back! I hope the fans, new and old will buy this CD."
3,"Cruelty will get you nowhere...I've been a big supporter of Cyndi since the very beginning. I wasn't real Gun Ho when I found out that she was doing a standards CD. I couldn't of been more wrong. Her intrepretation is flawless, and the songs show us a Cyndi we're not used to hearing. She must of needed a long good rest after this, because she drains every ounce of emotion into this CD. Her voice is honestly captivating and reaches amazing levels that few out there could match. Not only is she so giving to her fans in her outpouring of gratitude for all the millions who have supported her (I've met her, and she is the most incredibly down to earth celebrity I've ever had the chance to meet), but she is an immensely talented singer whose voice will be as enduring and strong as her fan base."
3,"This is a lovely book that introduces girls to beautiful paintings in a way that they can relate to. Not only is the introduction to beautiful art invaluable; the book encourages delving into the imagination in a wonderful and subtle way. The subject matter, even the expressions on the subjects' faces brings the art to life. I highly recommend this to parents of thoughtful, reading girls. Kudos to American Girl Library for bringing us such a special book."
3,"I read this in a few nights when I could. I didn't want to put it down. Great Plot, Good Story. I can't wait for Owl's next one."
3,"I Downloaded ""Wolf in Man's Clothing"" after church on Sunday and started reading. It is a book and others by Mignon G. Eberhart that one doesn't wont to put down. Love her books. Have most of them I was able to get years ago. My Favorites are with the Nurse Sarah Keate and Detective Lance O'Leary. I am hoping to see more on Kindle such as""The Patient in Room 18"", ""While the Patient Slept"", ""From the Dark Stairway"" ""Man Missing"", and ""The Mystery of Hunting's End"". These are some of her first books. Wonderful writing though they were written years ago. Do not miss these. I also downloaded ""The Chiffon Scarf"" which is also very good. Most of the books I have named are available on Amazon. Some paperback and some Hardback. There are several more by Eberhart on Kindle. I just happen to be partial to the ones I named and a few more. Do try them."
3,"I have taken two semesters of college German using this book and so far, pretty good! We are in Kapitel 7 right now. I like the pictures and the realia. But I feel it gives enough grammar, too. The explanations are really clear. The accompanying materials are good, too.Unfortunately, I don't think it is a self-teaching book. It really demands a classroom, and a TV/VCR. Though it is expensive, it is worth it!"
3,"Decent product, thicker than other mats I was looking at. Also this was less expensive than the thinner mats.Was delivered quick."
3,"I just recently got back into King Diamond. I assumed his later work would suck after growing up with everything from Fatal Portrait up to ""The Eye"". Boy was I wrong. Voodoo, House of God, Abigail II are great. The Puppet Master blew me away. The songwriting is impeccable, the story is good, and King sounds as good as ever. The female vocalist is such an awesome addition as well. I'm mad I found out about this album AFTER he came to town last year. I will definetely see him in concert next time around. Don't even think about it...BUY THIS ALBUM!!"
3,"I'm happy to say that this album has been a really pleasant surprise. I haven't really cared for much of Diamond's 90's work. He had a really bad habit of recycling tired ideas.But this album is very much a return to form for the King. The riffs are interesting, the solos are well done, and the storyline is pretty interesting and much less confusing that what the King has done lately. The vocals are also much improved here...Diamond does a good job of actually singing instead of just hitting high-notes for the sake of high-notes. It also comes with a DVD that is nice for delving into the storytelling aspects of the album.All in all, I'd recommend this album highly."
3,"This book is best suited for someone who has at least some Sanskrit, but for the student who has the basics, but is weak on vocabulary, this is an excellent text. The layout is similar to Sargeant's edition of the Bhagavad-Gita, but S gives a more complete syntactic overview and each verse has a prose retelling (in devanagari only), which is quite good for the intermediate student to practice vocabulary, grammar, and reading.With over 700 verses, this is an extensive text. There are some typos, but they should not trouble the average student."
3,"I've read Rita Herron's romantic suspense, paranormal, and contemporary novels. She always creates a great plot and more importantly a hero and heroine that I can truly root for! Talk about a woman willing to take matters into her own hands to make sure she gets the HEA she deserves. With a brave heart, good friends, a great sense of humor and the right guy, Maddie totally deserved finding love in the end. Another wonderful story!"
3,"We found this book and my daughter fell in love with it! She is 8 and enjoys just sitting and reading the information. Whenever she gets inspired by nature, she looks forward to sitting down to research what information the Handbook of Nature Study offers."
3,"People are fond of comparing ""Seinfeld"" to ""I Love Lucy"" and ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"", and they always mean it in a very complimentary way, but let's get real: You only watch those other shows if nothing else is on. They were never put in place to compete with first-run shows. With the expanded cable of the 21st century, ""Seinfeld ' is up against first-run comedys every night. After I give the new guys a chance or two, I still wind up getting more laughs from ""Seinfeld"" shows that I've seen a dozen times or more. The best series ever. And -that- is even with the stupid cable-edited versions. To get the intact orginal show is going to be even better."
3,"If you love Seinfeld this is an awesome season to buy. It's chock full of memorable scenes and lines. ""The Gum"" episode gets me every time! If you need a laugh or a walk down memory lane, buy this season!"
3,My son is collecting Seinfeld and asks for these on his birthdays andChristmas holidays so I give them to him. He is a young adult. I toofind the program funny and enjoy the extra features on the DVD.
3,"My copy is an 1987 Garland release (Dunhill), titled ""Planet Earth Calling"", with different, bizarre album cover art. Strange. A solid album, with smokin' guitar work by Ho Young Kim...who is he, and what else has he done?"
3,"I use my toaster a few times a day. I usually have to replace every year, because we live in a throw away society where products are not meant to last. A few hundred dollars for a toaster is a lot of $$ to spend, but I'm hoping it will last for a long time. So far, so good...it toasts bread and looks good on the counter."
3,"Hammer products are all good except the Solids. The solids are to dry, which Hammer mentions. The gel tastes good and works. I pour it into a flask and use it on my long bike rides.I haven't felt any spikes from it and it doesn't seem to amp me up."
3,"Very nicely put together, great graphics throughout (though the Janet Lane paintings are not necessary), nice color section. Only reason I deducted a star is because it is short at 95 pages."
3,"The author's focus is primarily China and Taiwan. However, I learned the most from his coverage of Japan and North Korea. I commend him on his selection of material and consistency of scope. The writing is direct and to the point, nothing fancy. The book is both concise and well written enough to read straight through. A scholar of any one country would probably not find enough meat, but as a regional overview for those interested in understanding the area's dynamics, the book is outstanding. Below is the table of contents:IntroductionU.S. Interests and Flashpoints of East AsiaThe Japanese MilitaryThe Chinese MilitaryThe Taiwanese MilitaryThe South Korean MilitaryThe North Korean MilitaryConclusion"
3,"People say the market has changed...it hasn't. People say times are different...they aren't. Dreman gives you the facts and backs them up with historical evidence that the same mistakes and assumptions are made over and over. There is nothing here that every rational investor shouldn't know, but people still buy into the ""next big thing"" style of investing. This book is well written, easy to follow, and Dreman repeats the facts you need to hear twice. It simply explains another piece of the investing puzzle. Classic stuff that should be on every investors shelf."
3,"This game is easy to learn and my kids (both under 7) can play it together without ""mom help"". Great for a rainy day!"
3,"This book was left open for the anticipated third book that I simply am having a hard time waiting for. I'd like to say that this series helped me through hurricane Katrina. I evacuated with book one, bought and read book two during evacuation, and have since returned home awaiting book three. In the meantime, I have had Odd Thomas, The Husband, and now Forever Odd....then I'll read Brother Odd. It's all Dean Koontz in my spare moments."
3,I bought this set for my husband and he said they were another good read by Koontz.
3,"This is a book of some unique, wonderfully illustrated fairy tales originating from the Nanai people of the Amur region of East Asia. Although the book is constructed as if it's intended for children, lots of the stories involve killing animals and often other people (in fact, in one story the skin of an evil person is made into boots!), so don't consider this as Disney-level child-friendly. But I also just want to clarify that this book was originally put together by Soviet Russians in the 1970s, and there is a very slight pro-Soviet worldview propagated in the tales. This is the most obvious in the very last tale, ""Kile Bamba and the Loche Bogatyr,"" in which a powerful white Russian dispels the Nanai's shamanistic beliefs and helps a Nanai village overthrow an evil Chinese merchant."
3,"Being new to Wicca, I found this book to be a good introduction to solitary practice. Buckland covers everything you need to know to start you on your path. Well written and easy to understand, I recommend this book to anyone interested in Solitary Wicca."
3,Buckland's clear and logical approach to this issue made things much clearer and nicely puts things into perspective.
3,"This books touches on the many ways God speaks. A casual read of this book will not yield the best benefits, one must read and seek explanation by the Word of God for fullest effect."
3,Joyce has a true annointing from God and this book contains much life-changing information and as with all of her books it's easy to read.
3,"I only discovered Dorothy Garlock books about a month ago, and have already read four. I've been hitting used book stores for more! This book is set in a oil boom town with Jill sent there to take care of an ill Aunt. I like these books because they are an easy read with twist and turns and of course a spunky romace. I have family from the areas she writes about and can envision them as young vibrant people with hopes and dreams, it makes me want to research my family history more. A great read!"
3,"This was my favorite book when I was a child, and now my kids love to read it as well. Extra bonus points if you can do a Grover voice!"
3,"We first found this book when my nephew was born, over 18 years ago. He loved it so much we had to read it several times each time he was at our house, so we got him his own copy. We still had to read it when he came over and his parents read it to him every night(no skipping pages allowed, no matter how many times we had read it !). Both copies were completely worn out. We have been looking for more copies since then. It is surely a sign of how good this book is that it is nearly impossible to find in used book stores."
3,"Do not get confused. This book seems to be written for children, and no doubt they will enjoy it. But this is, hands down, one of the greatest, most lucid and simple books on post-modern angst I can think of. The message: We always have a fear of a painful and uncertain end, and we do whatever we can to avoid the inevitable. But, in the end, the monster is ourselves. Buy this for your favorite existentialist or buddhist. You will not be disappointed. I even used this book as a source for my Master's Thesis on Absurdist theatre. It warrants praise."
3,I loved this book as a child; my 10-year-old loved this book; now my toddler is a fan. Book is great for Sesame Street fans but is also a great book on its own merits.
3,This is one of my daughter's favorite books. She is five years old now. I even read the book to her Kindergarten class and they loved it. Several children asked to borrow it.
3,"This is a fun book that I came across at a book fair and recognized as an old childhood favorite. The basic theme is that Grover keeps saying not to turn the page, and then humorously berates you when you do turn the page. So now my niece is getting a copy! If your kid likes Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus by Mo Willems, he or she will like this book too."
3,A favorite book since I was a child. So happy to share with my children. They are always excited to read this story.
3,"This book was the first book I learned to read. I spent 3 years trying to find it, only to be told that they no longer printed it. I found it in a book store but then my sister lost it. AARRGGHH!This is a great Muppet book and it just goes to show the versatility of the man who was Jim Henson. I recommend it for all ages! =)"
3,I loved this book as a child and wanted to share it with my daughter. She loves the sounds and noises when we read it. I recommend it for everyone.
3,"We are really happy with this product. We have the infant bundle me that doesn't have the more protective cover, and like this one much better."
3,"Overall we are quite happy with the BundleMe, which fits perfectly into our infant car seat (Graco SnugRide). The product is of good quality, though the zippers are not running very smoothly. Regarding its design, the only downside we see is that the front part is very loose, making it difficult to get a tight enough fit around baby's neck and shoulders to keep him warm in colder weather. Bottom line, however, is that it is a good product that we can recommend."
3,"This is a very good idea and it is good quality also. My only complaint, and the reason for 4 stars rather than 5 is that it isn't really compatible with the Baby Jogger stroller. I can make it work, but it falls off every once in a while and if I want to recline the seat back, I cannot keep the Bundleme hooked on. Besides that it's great."
3,Disappointed i cant get. My tod is 38 inches long at 22 months. He is longer than the product. Oh well maybe the next one.
3,I would buy this in every color if I could. I absolutely love it. It fits great and is so much more comfy then blankets. All winter babies need one!
3,"When I heard from my friend that Claudio from Coheed and Cambriawas involved with this project, I new that I had to give it a listen.Anadivine's 8-song EP is an impressive debut which mixes melodic hardcore with punk. Tracks such as ""Alcohol and Oxygen,""""Emily,"" and ""...the frequency hostage"" keeps one hoping for more from the band. For less then ten dollars this is well worth it."
3,"I found the book very motivating and the explanations are clear, simple to understand and answered many of my questions. I would recommend it to anyone wanting a sensible, long-term solution to weight control."
3,"This product is easy on my rather dry scalp and it is good for saving the color of your hair. I don't use it every time, I alternate, because while it is alright for hair texture, it isn't perfect for my hair, and my curly hair seems to do better alternating. It is still much better than many brands I have tried, though, so I give it a 4 star."
3,"I bought this for my violin student for Christmas. It was definitely worth the money, and I really enjoyed all of the selections. So did she!"
3,"I was just getting back into classical music and heard one song on internet radio. I believe it was Casta Diva. I loved it and decided to give the whole cd a try. Not a weak song on it. His playing is exquisite. If you love beautiful, romantic music then this is a must buy!"
3,"Gloria Koenig has written a wonderful book about what it takes to get icons established. Not everyone is excited about new ideas and the perserverence required to build these well-known structures is often forgotten or misunderstood as we embrace those places that define Los Angeles. Each building, structure, or monument is thoughtfully explored, in rich, condensed prose and the photographs reveal the beauty and majesty of iconic Los Angeles. A good read, fabulous photographs, and thoughtful examination of the process to get from here to there. Most all my favorites are here."
3,"I agree with some other reviews that the plastic honey bear & ""Aunt Jemima"" lights are bit ... uhhhh, cheesey; however, there is tons of other stuff that is very classy and it has great photos and interesting tidbits. Despite a few cheesetastiks, it's still WELL WORTH the price and a must-have for any fan of HALLOWEEN!!!"
3,I really enjoyed reading this book. It was hard to understand the words at times but that doesn't take away from the story. There are many different characters in this book which makes it hard to follow at times. The ending was predictable but that didn't away from the enjoyment of following Mary from rags to riches.
3,I loved this book! Story plot was easy to follow. It was predicable in places but the flow from one event to another synchronized together eloquently. I couldn't put it down.
3,The setting was a time and place seldom thought about today. The circumstances were also a neglected subject matter. This was nicely done.
3,"Like most ""tall"" people, I hesitate buying pants online, in any form. But I figured, since these are just for working out, what's the difference. I was pleasantly suprised when these pants arrived. They were actually long enough for me...I'm 5'll"" and the medium was just right, even in the length. I also loved how super stretchy they are."
3,"The Big Moo sets us at the edge of a cliff and says ""you've got two options: jump and do something remarkable or stay seated as time goes by, and envying people who dares to jump. So, what's your choice?""This is a book addressed to everyone, a book that make us think in improving the way we do things, not only professionally, but also in our personal life. Although it is sometimes far from reality and too close to a dreamer's vision of the workplace, it explores and shakes our comfort zone and the limits of it. The Big Moo asks for changes in the approach, in the way we face things in everyday life, and it asks for it shouting!It's an enthusiastic, inspirational and positive reading which message says ""do things according to yourself and your beliefs, and the most important, do them now!"".I surely recommend it!"
3,"Unfortunately, out of print - but seek it out any way you can. A fascinating, wonderful, and truthful account of the life of a daughter of the Samurai class, which had existed for centuries, just at the time when it was beginning its decline. Much of what you read in this book will explain the behaviour of modern-day Japanese. As an American living in Japan, that has proved invaluable. The book is well-written, focused, imaginative, whimsical, and resourceful, just like the author herself. If you can get your hands on a copy, be prepared to fall in love with Etsu-bo!"
3,"This is a great player. I use it in flights and the size, design and image quality are perfect. It plays all media promised, including DVD-RW movies and MP3 music.The sound is very good, though if you don't have noise canceling headphones you could find the volume a little low for noisy areas.The battery life is shorter than 2.5 hours promised, but not less than 2 hours. The card adapter is useful (also works in airplanes)Overall is a great player and I'm very happy with it."
3,This is an excellent book. David McCullough is one of the best historians . His books are always goodI highly recommend this book
3,"This work is a true joy to read. McCullough, like his subject, Truman, has a knack for ""telling it like it is."" I have quite a number of Truman Biographies in my collection and have read several others. This by far, in my opinion is the best. The author has been very ballanced in his study of this leader, showing warts and all. He does it nicely though. Now I must admit to being a big fan of Truman so I am sure my assessment of this work is flavored by that liking. Nevertheless, I do feel I know good writing when I see it, and McCullough's style is extremely readable. I would very much recommend this work for anyone interested in the life of this great American President, and would recommend it for anyone wanting to begin a study of his life and, just as importantly, his times. I really fell you cannot go wrong with this work. Actually, this is one you will probably want to purchase, because, like me, you may want to give it more than just one reading."
3,"I love David McCullough's work. His books are highly readable and enjoyable. I don't feel the author's opinions coming through, which is important when writing a historical text.It should be a read for history classes. Great recommendation"
3,"Harry S. Truman was a President who did what was right rather than what was popular. This book shows a man make big decisions in a way which asks not what will make the country he leads happy, but what will make it strong. This book is a must read to understand a time of considerable change in the United States. It is an excellent book!"
3,"David McCullough is one of the best biographers I have ever read. This, along with McCullough's more recent book on John Adams, is one of the best books I have ever read. After reading this, you feel as though you truly know Truman. The greatness and the faults of the man come shining through."
3,"I listened to this book on tape while driving across country and I REALLY enjoyed it. A very fascinating story, and it was very well read on tape. I also thought it was neat that they had audio clips of Truman's actual speeches in the book on tape. From what I have ""learned"" so far in my education, I think the book is accurate. The book has many wonderful anecdotes about Truman."
3,"There is something for everyone in this excellent biography. Democrats will revel in the last great age of liberalism, with a truly populist president who actually believed government could make life better for the average citizen. Republicans can admire a great man who was a great president, a man wholly matched with the incredible demands of the momentous events he shaped and influenced.McCullough has written a masterpiece, worthy of the attention of anyone who is interested in the history of our country in the middle of the 20th century. I've read many political biographies, and this stands with the very best, both in terms of writer and subject."
3,"A good read, didn't expect much from the book but i didn't like the book as much but many of you have different opinions"
3,"The product is really good, it was exactly what I expected the product is. I can recommend it to all who are interested in purchasing this item. The people should buy it because it's reliable..."
3,"Cry The Beloved Country was an outstanding book! It showed the importance of family, and how far one will go to save his own family. Stephen Kumalo, the main character in this book, travels to Johanesburg to help his sister Gertrude. He runs into many obstacles along the way. This book is set in South Africa, and many words used in the book are South African. These words may confuse the reader, but still conveys the outstanding work of the writer. I enjoyed this book very much, and recomended to everyone that enjoys reading novels, of love and pain!"
3,"For those that are into the smooth jazz or fusion, funk, contemporary, jazz-rap genre should own this album. This could be 3rd or 4th album I purchased from Bob James on LP. I originally own The Genie (1st album I listen to), Heads, and Bj4.'Bout to get into H, Double Vision, One, Two and Three a lil bit.Songs incl. I loved: Angela (Theme from Taxi), Touchdown, and my favorite easy-listening track of all-time I Want to Thank You (Very Much) (Brings me back good memories).An excellent must-have."
3,"I used to sleep only 3 to 4 hours each night. When I wake up, I used to take a half tablet of ambien to help me make other 3 hours. It was kinda a torture when I wake up very energetic after 3 hours during the night, then force myself to sleep again with the help of the ambien. In my way of looking for an alternate solution, I found Deep Sleep, and I decided to try it out. Since I used this product, I can do now 6 or even 7 hours of sleep in one shot. I take one pill one hour before I go to bed, then I take another pill immediately before I go to bed, and that's it. For almost 4 weeks now, it is working great."
3,"I am 9 years old. The story is about how Lily's gets through all of the bad times in her life when her Dad goes off to war and her best friend moves away. But when Albert moves in, things start to brighten up for Lily."
3,"This book is about a young girl named Elizabeth,but everyone called her Lily. Every summer she spends it at her sumer home in Rockaway,Queens,with her father and grandmother. Her mom died when she was a baby. This summer only her grandmother and her went to the vacation house. Her father stood home and worked. She spends all summer in Rockawy and has a great time. I enjoyed this book. I think that it is a good book to read because it is about summer vacation and how this girl thinks. I would recomend it to anyone.Igive it 4 stars."
3,Both my 11year old and I read this and loved the book. The characters were flawed like all of us but easy to love. Good story with good lessons. Y
3,"The unusual in the soundtrack of ""Mona Lisa smile"" is the use of modern recreations instead of old recordings. Without losing any credibility the modern performers refresh the classic songs and make the new versions acceptable both for the collector and the casual listener. Where else you can hear ""Istanbul(Not Constantinople)"" still sounding new? And classics as ""Smile"" by Barbra Streisand or ""The heart of every girl"" by Elton John."
3,"I didn't see the movie, but I heard Murder, He Says, sung by Tori Amos someplace else, and then learned it was on this album. Since I grew up in the 50s and adore all that music, I decided to give this album a try, although I usually don't like covers of MY original songs by new singers. But what a surprise! All these songs are great! I love Tori Amos' singing and the songs she does sound great here. As a contrast, I thought almost all the music done by current singers on the recent movie D'Lovely were pretty awful! They just threw those songs away. But this CD is great! Highly recommended for anyone who loves 50s music -- especially early 50s."
3,"I bought this item so that I could use our companies VoIP system. The headset and USB dongle worked very well and also allowed me to switch between the VoIP system and my cell phone (Palm Centro).I also tried to use this with my iPhone 4, but the sound quality is not as good. I don't attribute this to the headset though."
3,"I Listen it, and it's not read by a computer...Jason MacCoy (Narrator) it's not a computer...maybe you received a wrong version, but my version it's great.thanks!"
3,"Almost anything sounds great in SACD and this performance is no exception, but if you're used to a 100 piece orchestra strumming violins to this score, you might be slighly disappointed. If you are looking for a different take on the four seasons and would appreciate the distinctive sound of a just a few instruments, this is for you"
3,"I have plantar's fasciitis and two heel spurs. The podiatrist sold me an orthotic for $25 which did a pretty good job in the beginning, but not good enough. She wanted to put me in specially-made orthotics for $500. I decided to do a little investigation on my own. I ordered this particular orthotic, started with the low, and am now up to the high insert. This is the best possible thing I could have done. It feels so good, the pain is gone and I can walk again! I even ordered a pair for my house shoes. They put my feet in the correct position, and help me walk right. I LOVE THEM!!!!"
3,"I give it 4 stars because the kids really like it. I thought it was just ok. Nothing special. The best thing I can say about it is, it gets the kids up and jumping and laughing."
3,My 4 year old and 20 month old love playing with this. They get a ton of exercise chasing and/or jumping over the bee and we have a lot of fun watching them.
3,"Our grandchildren -- boys and girls aged six to eight -- thoroughly enjoyed making the potholders and then using them in the kitchen. We recall their parents having the same reaction 25 years ago. This is a wonderful, constructive activity fit for small fingers."
3,"There is no doubt in my mind that D. Higgs is a very capable organist, however I was expecting a bit more from this CD. This mammoth instrument never fails to satisfy because of its size and versatility. However, one fails to perceive the enormous space in which the instrument is situated. The mixture of substantial organ works with those of the more ""fluffy"" variety did not seem to work. The gradual crescendo to the end of the Bolcom fantasia highlights the vast resources of this instrument all to be crowned by a blare of trumpets with full organ tutti."
3,Want to have a lot of fun with 4-6 friends? Try this game! You can actually play with 8 players and have enough cards.
3,I love this game. It's fun and easy to play but also keeps people on their toes. The wild card changes every round so you really have to pay attention. Similar to playing rummy except it's two decks with an extra suit (stars). I liked this game so much when I first played it that I bought a bunch of them for stocking stuffers.
3,Fun game that you can actually talk while you play! All ages. Easy to take on vacations or just spend friend and family time.!
3,"Five Crowns card game is a great game for the whole family - all ages.It's definitely a new concept in that it has no aces and five suits - ""stars"" is the fifth suit.As always, Amazon got it here in a hurry too!"
3,The Five Crowns cards purchased at Amazon.com are very difficult for children to shuffle. It would be nice to have a choice of plastic playing cards available even at a higher price. I have always been satisfied with Amazon's products and service.
3,"I saw learned about this game from a book I read and it seemed like a similiar game to this one. I love to play rummy and this game is very much like it. It's a long, fun game that really isn't over 'til The Kings Go Wild!"
3,Game recommended by a family member. Great tool for learning math skills. The only thing about the cards is that they bend easily when used by younger children.
3,This makes for great family night gather or we play when friends come over just for a relaxing evening. Great fun for all
3,"Five crowns cardgame is highly addictive, to say you like to play it again and again. I'ts also a game of strategy and sure some luck if you get enough wild cards or jokers, but sometimes you've to change your hand to a next series if the moment seems right to do so. It's lots of fun."
3,"The CD was great, but this is a truly spectacular recording in the SACD version. While the selections tilt the balance more towards the secular, one of the most richly rewarding large versions of Silent Night are included in the ""A Christmas Flourish"" medley, all grounded by the deep pedal tones of the C. B. Fisk pipe organ. The Festival Fanfare for Christmas is great fun.This disc certainly makes a joyful noise and will give your sound system a full workout!"
3,"Although it was originally published in 1990, this book was the most relevant I read during my tour of Iraq. I found many direct comparisons between the concepts mentioned by Mr. O'neil and the operations of the Iraqi insurgency. If you are interested in learning the inner workings of insurgency, or especially if you are delpoying to Iraq (in an MI capacity), you need to read this book."
3,"I would not be getting such a great book with lots of advance examples, tips, tricks, and most of all it's the most valueble book. I mostly recommend that you buy this book, trust me and you won't regret!"
3,"Set is a fantastic game. My husband and I love to play in the evening. But don't play with people looking over your shoulder because they can't seem to help saying ""I see a set,"" which drives me insane. If you're looking for a good way to pass the time, or to unwind, and you don't like idle behavior, this is the game for you. I do wonder if color blind people can play, though, because two of the colors are green and red. Wouldn't they not be able to tell them apart? Seems like they could have foreseen that and chosen orange or something."
3,"Set is an absolutely amazing game. It's what my roommate and I do instead of homework. Not only is the game a lot of fun, but it is also a great mind game because you have to think quickly and use logic to make sets. One game always seems to turn into seven since it is super addictive to play."
3,"An excellent game in which players build sets based on number, shape, color and pattern. I want to like it, but most of the folks at my house are color blind and have a hard time differentiating between the red, green and blue cards. The non-color blind have a definite advantage!"
3,This cape is very durable. I wear it often. It is comfortable and I would buy more from the seller.
3,"I purchased this for my seven-year-old daughter, who was working on a class project on the Navajo and wanted to produce some textiles as part of her presentation. She'd used potholder looms before, but felt that she needed to step up to something more ""serious"" -- and that's exactly what this loom provided. It's still a tad small for making real rugs, but is sized right for small tapestries, mousepads, and handbags. The instructions provided (and especially the pattern) were a bit generic and cryptic for a seven-year-old, but I was able to puzzle them out with her after an afternoon of fiddling; she can now weave basic multi-color patterns completely unaided, although more of that is rooted in her dedication than in anything provided with the kit. It's well-built, though, and has held up to a fair bit of use."
3,"Once again, Master P provides us with another tight album! The best songs are 17 Reasons, Dead Presidents, When They Gone, the title track, and 1-900-MASTERP! If you like gangsta rap made 100% for the streets, buy this today!"
3,"I bought this loom for my 9-year old niece, who loves crafts. We spent almost 2 hours making potholders and other items with the loom. It was easy for her to use, and the metal held up well. She had a plastic one where one of the teeth had broken off, but the metal one eliminated that issue. It is a low-tech, relatively easy craft for children and the fact that they can also make something useful helps make it a fun idea on a dreary day."
3,"I had been looking for a copy of this for years! Maybe the best, most comprehensive look at all the genres of underground music from late 70's/early 80's. Not any hardcore but lots of punk stalwarts at their best and lots of lesser-known bands that deserved to be heard from. The best part is probably the fact there are no insipid interviews or contrived set-ups--just music, music, music!"
3,"When you read this book, you end up loving it for all the wrong reasons. In the end, you'll hate it for all the right ones.Take your time with this one and try to absorb it all.My heart goes out to any and all who had to go through that hateful period of human history."
3,"the thing i that i like about this book is that it is told form a person that was really their, and that all of these things that happen is true.the thing that i dislike about this book is that all of the people that died in this book, how his dad died in front of him, some of the words in this book was german and we did not know what it ment.i would not change anything.to show people what really happen during this time period.that all these people died"
3,"Elie Wiesel's Night is a true account of the terror and horror that the holocaust cast upon millions of Jews. Wiesel's tale is filled with shocking stories of death and destruction. This book may be hard to read for some, but must be read by all because the trials and tribulations that millions of Jews faced must never be forgotten."
3,"I liked this book because it kept me interested the whole time. It was very informative, it taught me facts about the haulocausts and about what had happened back then with the Jews. Before reading this book I didn't know anything about this, so this book helped me to understand and be aware of what had happened not so long ago, to the Jews. Also I liked this book because it had a lot of details which helped me to understand it a lot better. One thing that I didn't like about Night is that it had a lot of words that I was not able to pronunciate so I had to skip over them, and keep reading. But other than that I think this book was a pretty good."
3,I read this book for school and though it was a very good book because I gave someone who was in the holocaust perspectivve of the book. I would recommed this book to anyone!
3,This was a great book that I bought for a young person and read it first. Im glad that I did.
3,"I had to read this book for my English class and I enjoyed it very much. I have read many books on the Holocaust and this was by far one of the best. Most books want to include the horror on a physical level but this book took the horror on a moral level. Elie Wiesel did a great job explaining the emotional pain and also the mental abuse that went along with the Holocaust. This is not a long book and would be good for younger kids that are interested in the Holocaust to read. The book is easy, the content isn't very graphic, and there isn't a lot, if any profanity. Overall I thought this was a great book that did a great job at describing things that are so hard to comprehend about the Holocaust."
3,"Wiesel tells what happened to him and his family in a very interesting book. I totally disagree with the people who only gave the book 4 or less stars, put yourself in that situation and see if you would write a book as good as this one."
3,"This book is very awesome! I thought that the germans are mean for killing and trapping the jews. Elie was awesome because he was one of the last survivers. It was very sad when his father died because he was struck in the head with the officers club. It was very heart breaking and it brought a tear to my eye. It was also sad in the fact that he got transferred to the childrens block and then when they called all the jews to the front and told them to evacuate so they could blow up the block. It would have been horrible to eat what they ate (a bit of grass or potatoe pillings). Over all the book was great and it grabed your attention. I couldn't put it down.Sincerly, Chuy Perches"
3,"Ellie does a good job describing his miserable existance in several concentration camps when he was 15. I was a little dissappointed that he didn't go into more detail, but that would have made the book much longer. This would be a wonderful book for 14 and 15 year-olds!!"
3,"Elie Wiesel's novel is his own horrifying account of the Nazi death camps. He uses simple, bare prose and images to tell his story and ""Night"" haunted me and filled me with sadness and questions. This book has been read widely and deserves to be continually read and re-read for the lessons about fallen human nature and the spirit of perseverence in the face of great evil. This is a short book, but all the more potent for its brevity. If you have not read it, you should buy or borrow a copy immediately. There are few equals to the power of this story."
3,"I really enjoyed Night by Elie Wiesel. It was great! Night is about how Elie Wiesel, a teenage boy lived through the Holocaust. Elie is separated from his mother and sister. He is transported by boxcar and even has to walk strenuously to multiple death camps. Elie encounters decisions on how to survive the time at the camps. This book is very well written and decribes in vivid detail of the life of someone living in the concentration camps. I would recomend this book to anyone it is one of the best books I have read!"
3,"This work is a grotesque, graphic depiction of our world's darkest hour. It opened my eyes to the grim reality of Holocaust and helped me to understand it like I never had before."
3,"In our Freshman Engilsh class we were assigned to read the book Night by Elie Wiesel. When we began to read Night it seemed to be very dragged on, but with in about 15 pages it started to get more intresting. Soon after that we could not take our eyes away from the book. We were so into the book that none of us wanted to put it down. This book gave us a vivid feeling of how the Jews felt while going through the Holocaust. The episode that captured our atttention the most was when the Jews where getting beaten. Jews felt unhuman, dogs were treated better than them. We rate this book a 5 because it was such a good book and we would love to read the sequals to Night by Elie Wiesel."
3,My son is into the older books by writers that he's heard about but never read....this arrived in time for Christmas and he has enjoyed it very much....
3,"Quite extraordinary! I am glad I had closure! It was good to see that Toto finally got the girl, and the girl got Toto. I was kind of mad at Alfredo, but in the end it was good because the story could have change a lot if he had spoken. This is an exquisite movie, the kind is very rarely made anymore. I so enjoyed the extra time in the movie, but I still adore the ending it always surprises me, don't know why."
3,"Johnson's engaging and humorous illustrations are once again paired with a kid-friendly story in his newest release. The animals who tell this action-packed story are the main attraction in Johnson's glorious, detailed, colorful, and animated tale of a hound-dog maitre d'/cook who loses his meatball (""when somebody sneezed"")! This book, along with Johnson's previous, award-winning books, is a real hit with young children and works great with group story-time readings since a sing-a-long is included in the back of the book. Johnson has written and illustrated another winner!!"
3,"I am a big Rammstein fan. Although I think Rosenrot is better, this is still a great album. If you like Rammstein check out Oomph!, they are another German band that is simmilar. Also about the Du hast issue, it is ""you have"" or a more accurate translation is ""you've"". If it were ""you hate"" then the line would not make sense as you hate me asked and I did not say anything. Also ""hate"" is pronounced with a long ""a"" where as ""have"" is pronounced with a short ""a"" sound."
3,"This cd is flawless! There are no bad or lagging tracks on the entire album. I got mine while on vacation in england, so i didnt pay as much for it. Im not sure what the difference is from the american release, but if there is much of a difference, buy the import version!"
3,"Diese CD ist super! Really it is. I would have paid twice the price for only half the songs on it. If you like this, go do yourself a favour and get all the other rammstein cds out there."
3,"This is a perfect CD 60min with heavy RammsteinThe bestEngel, Tier, Du Hast, Klavier, Spiel mit mir"
3,"What I love about rammstein is first off that they sing in German (well they had to but still), second off their show is just great, when I saw them I was standing way up front and it was great!!!!!!!!!! Only too bad some songs sound a bit the same ... But still like I stated above they are the perfect entertainment!!!!!!! And the lyrics are 'funny' in a way, they don't take themselves to serious! I have all of their cd's and Sehnsucht is the best (together with the single-cd's 'Stripped' (funny to hear Till sing English) and 'Das Modell') If you like to go crazy in a 'good' way I should defeniatelly buy this cd!!"
3,"As a long time admirer of Edward Sheriff Curtis's photography, I was thrilled to find this DVD and now, to own it. The first time I watched I felt frustrated because I wanted to know when and where the photos were taken, but there was no information accompanying the images. The second time through I opted to watch with subtitles--all my questions were answered. I recommend this video to anyone who loves photography, as I do, and to those of us who appreciate and respect Native American culture. The sound track with music made by Native Americans enhances the experience. This DVD is a gem."
3,I love Shelby Flint. Her voice is on a par with Karen Carpenters. Her crystal clear voice quality is very enjoyable.
3,"This is an interlinear with a built in concordance. The New Testament translation is NRSV. There are Strong's numbers over the Greek texts in the interlinear. Handy and thorough, one of my favorite tools."
3,"I was very impressed with the quality of these. I hesitated for a long time, trying to decide which kind to get. Very pleased with my decision."
3,The Icicle Works were always Ian McNabb's vehicle into musical explorations. Anthemic compositions combined with top-notch musicianship make this collection of songs an enjoyable listening experience. What makes it difficult is also what makes it fun as McNabb constantly assumes different musical persona's. A commercial liability but a treat nonetheless this album captures McNabb in transition from being a group member leaving the 80's behind to becoming a solo artist in the 90's.
3,"I really enjoyed Season two up until the last episode. I thought the last episode was put together kind of corny at the end. FBI agent flying off to exact some revenge on a terrorist didn't seem as realistic as the other episodes. Overall, a very thought provoking series."
3,"SRDU's new CD, ""Freedom's Marching Backwards"" reflects the creative humor as well as the intelligence of their music. It marks a move away from guitar oriented rock towards more harmonic arrangements, caustic lyrical content, and tighter song structures. The music is best described as oddly humorous with pointed commentary and a disjointed din of buzzing guitars, keyboard whine and snappy rhythms. The band's sound is distinctly Midwestern, often recalling the Great Plains and consisting of art pop and lo-fi punk."
3,"This is Asia in a different light. Going in a different direction they produce an outstanding album without losing their progressive style. Payne's best work to date, and Mr. Downes is impressive as always."
3,"I'm a first-time author and your book was very helpful. There was so much information that I used to sell and promote my books. My books are powerful, inspiring, and true...Thank you,Dutchess Taylor, Author of:The Devil's PlaygroundandRedemption & Deliverance"
3,"The author provided excellent advice but in some respects, for online marketing, is already dated since he did not provide any information on the new rage, Facebook.Still, lots of good ideas presented and certainly motivational."
3,"I purchased this towel ring to go in my kitchen near the sink. I have no other place to put a kitchen towel. I love the look and was excited to put it up. I must have messed up with installation a bit, because the ring moves sometimes and goes askew, but not too bad. Overall I am really happy. They look great and work well."
3,"This is the third CD I have of Steve's as with all of them it is superb, cannot get it out of my player every song is a classic, move over Rod Stewart this guy has it wright.what a shame we do not here more about him, but once discovered never forgotten a real Gem."
3,Steve has mastered the art of taking a standard tune and making it sound brand new. That is talent! The vocals and the arrangements are outstanding. Steve ranks with the great crooners of the ages. It's all about class and style. Steve has it all. Each CD of Steve's stands on it's own merit. All are equally great and all have that special soemthing! Keep them coming Steve.
3,Most of the Leap Frog learning videos are great for the kids. I highly recommend them. The kids love to watch them and I love that they are learning good things at the same time.
3,"Social Security IS a PONZI scheme (P 150). I got all mine out in just 5 years, and plan to live another 20! Also, Textbooks and teachers all LIE to us (but they were lied to as well). Also, the government and ALL religious leaders."
3,"Master and Commander (the book) is one of the best sea adventure to be ever put down in writing. Music as all the fans of P. O'brien's Maturin-Aubrey series know is an important integral part of his story telling. Although I was rather disappointed by the fact that the film-makers combined two separate books into one film--necessitated by the practicality of film-making--I think they did a fine job of integrating the music--the violin-cello joust between Aubrey and Maturin's charaters. As to the complaints about the soundtrack not having any ""sea shanties"" or old British sailors' songs, I would recommend people to look up ""Roast Beef of Old England"" published by ESSAY in 2000 in combination with two other titles ""Musical Evening with the Captain"" vol 1 & 2. The three CDs cover most of the music mentioned in the book series, including the one song ""Spanish Lady"" featured in the film--though not sung by the same people as in the film."
3,Lots of illustrations & excellent CD with animations helped a lot. I used three books from this series in a class.
3,"When we moved our daughter from a baby seat to a Novara Afterburner we had to remove the rear rack on our Wildwood Tandem. But we still needed to take along some gear on our bike rides. The Topeak TourGuide Handle Bar Bag DX has proven to be more than an adequate solution. The mounting instructions are not too difficult to follow, and there is an ingenious system with a cable that wraps around your handlebars and prevents the bag from sinking down.This bag has two main compartments, a couple of side compartments, a rain cover, and a clear plastic holder for a ride map. All and all it is a very useful piece of equipment and I highly recommend it."
3,"Chair-Loc does just that without gluing, or the necessity of taking furniture apart.It is thin enough to slide into the smallest cracks. What it does in there is causes the wood to swell and fit tightly once again.A treatment lasts so long that since I last used it on my antique furniture, I have moved, and none of the local hardware stores have even heard of it, let alone carry it. I found it at Amazon.The directions that come with it are easy to read and follow. IT ONLY WORKS ON WOOD. Sorry to shout at you like that, but I don't want you to waste your money on the wrong product."
3,"As many of Ella's fans know, she was known for her flawless and perfect interpretation of great jazz standards and American pop. However, her ability to interepret a blues lyric flawlessly and give it the same meaning as a Billie Holiday, is often overlooked. With this album, Ella sounds as if she has spent her entire career wailin' the blues. What a great album from the First Lady of Song!"
3,"Watched the movie in my youth and remembered it being a wonderfully moving experience so just wanted to see if it had the same effect and it did, again enjoyed it and am pleased to now have it in my DVD collection."
3,"I purchased this cookbook and it is by far the smartest format that I've ever seen. I find it difficult to find the time to write a weekly menu, shop and cook daily. The book is arranged by season, and broken down into weekly menues AND shopping lists. So far I've completed 2 weeks of menues and they've been delicious. I have shared the meals with 3 other adults and all the recipes have been rated based on whether they'd like to have them again in the future. I am happy to say the recipes got 3 out of 4 thumbs up, and 4 out of 4 thumbs up. I am very pleased with the recipes and the cookbook is making my life easier and providing a lot of variety."
3,"I've been faithfully using the original Saving Dinner for quite some time and purchased SDLC about 2 months ago. I love the low carb version equally but differently than the original. For starters, I thought going low carb was a fad. Little did I know the nutritional benefits! Second, these menus serve 4 instead of 6. Since it's just me and my 1 year old DD, I use 1 week of menus to last 2 weeks. It's great and I don't have so many leftovers that I feel like I'm eating the same thing all the time! Third, I've discovered I love soup. Who knew?!? I thought I was a soup-hater. Turns out I LOVE homemade soups and have a huge distaste for the canned stuff. Finally, I've learned to embrace new vegetables. This is a big deal for me. I'm 26 and only learned to love vegetables in my 20s. Now I'm expanding my horizons even more.If you haven't checked out Leanne Ely's books, I encourage you to do so. Be adventurous! Try something new! If nothing else, learn how to plan a menu the way she does."
3,This movie is a must buy for your library. I am originally from this town and now live in Texas. Needless to say I am proud of the baseball heritage; but most of all I'm proud of the family unit that this town portrays. It's a great gift idea.
3,"I got these for my Alex DeLarge Halloween costume and was very happy with them, I had looked around for other fake eyelashes like the ones from the movie and wasn't able to find a whole lot. I got these and they were just what I wanted. Thick long lashes, worked out great."
3,"This book is one of those rare and inspiring ones that melds a passionate spirituality with some history, an intense regard for humanity, and a wonderful sense of humor. Its the kind of book you read and think to yourself ""These are things I've know all along and just couldn't put into words."" Every work of Alan Watts is a gem as far as I'm concerned, but every word in this book in particular gives the impression that here is a man who laughed a lot and who enjoyed every aspect of living. I can't recommend it too highly."
3,"Since I have such a busy schedule I occasionally miss some of the new episodes of Cheaters, so now that I have the dvd set I was able to catch up on some of my favorite episodes and some new ones that I didn't catch earlier. Since buying the set I haven't been able to stop playing those ugly and gruesome confrontations, I even got my sister into Cheaters, now we can both watch all of the episodes together!"
3,"I use this mat daily for my ""Baby Bootcamp"" class I take, and I use it mostly in the grass. It is VERY easy to clean (with a damp sponge) and is more water resistant than a Tuffo mat. I didn't give it a 5-star because it doesn't always fold up easy (when you fold it up you really have to squish all the air out) so most of the time I don't velcro it up closed. I get a lot of compliments on the colors."
3,I take this with us every time we go on a trip to the coast. It is perfect for sitting or laying on for the beach. Never lets the dampness of the wet sand through and is a lot more comfortable than a towel any day.
3,"I had purchased this item perviously for a gift and planned on purchasing one for myself to keep in the car. I had to wait as it wasn't available only to be sent the item in a different pattern. The pattern (stripes) I received is fine, but definitely not the cocoa bubble pattern that I waited for. As it isn't imperative that I have the cocoa bubble pattern, I am keeping the item I received, but it was a disappointment after having to wait."
3,"It's big (for an infant), it cleans up easy, and it's relatively cheap. Not unattractive, either. If it just folded up a bit more easily, I'd give it five stars. As it is, we haven't found a better ground blanket for our babies."
3,got this for my wife when we managed to leave our previous zip up picnic blanket at a soccer game ;-) so far she loves it the insert guide that helps with folding makes life easier and it's heavy enough that light winds and little feet don't move it around/create wrinkles/ and flip parts over.
3,"its really cute and a good size. very durable. we already used it at a barbeque, a baby shower and in the park. cant wait to take it to the beach!"
3,This product is as described.. Comfortable and portable. Received sooner then expected. I bought this as a gift for a friend.. And she was happy with it.
3,This blanket looks just as shown and folds up easily. Its lightweight which will make it convenient to pack along wherever you go. Also the price is low enough that even if it doesnt last forever it still a bargain. Love it!
3,The periscope arrived undamaged and works fine. I purchased it to look into the space under my low-slope roof to see possible leaks in the future. Nice views of rafters and insulation.
3,my chinnie hangs out on this thing all time! i also noticed she likes to chew on it once in awhile though lol
3,"If you haven't heard Judy Henske what she does is pretty much beyond explanation. If you have heard her - you don't need any explanation.Through fire and flood and the other calamities of life I've managed to preserve or replace about a dozen of my favourite lps from the early 60s -- This one and ""High Flyin' Bird"", Judy Henske's second album are among that dozen. She is the only living person who can compete with Bessy Smith on ""Nobody Knows You When You're Down & Out"" - unfortunately that cut is on another album which didn't survive.Some of the comedy on the album gets old fairly fast. For many years I've listened to a tape I made of it, which cut out the comedy -- it was pretty good but after a few hundred hearings you can live without it."
3,"Just for fun I looked around the room and plugged in a random item or two, and this came up! I had no idea Amazon sold LladrÃ³ porcelain.Although we received this as a gift some years ago, it is still a current catalog item (Issue year 2000, Nao #02001350). You can order it direct, but the shipping would cost $22.""My Little Bouquet"" is a beautiful piece of art. The subject matter and delicate coloring make it a perfect wedding present. Sculpted by Marco Antonio NoguerÃ³n.What else is there to say? I am still flabbergasted this is on Amazon. Not just through a Marketplace seller, but ""Ships from and sold by Amazon.com."" I wonder: does it drop ship from Spain or did Amazon acquire some quantity of these for its warehouses?What's next here? Buying a car? (Maybe.)"
3,"Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, is a great game. I just have some disagreements with some parts. The graphics could be better, the 3rd person view is terrible, and the fighting style isn't all that great. On the plus side however, you have 100+ hours of gameplay, a captivating storyline, and the ability to make your character look like whatever you want. Also, the landscaping job is awesome, I absolutely love free roam games."
3,"The greatest adventure role playing game of all time. You will find yourself completely immersed in the many layers of the Oblivion world for not just months, but years."
3,"Yes! Si! Oui!, este es una de las artistas mexicanas que realmente escribe, canta, toca su mÃºsica, el albÃºm en sÃ­ no es supremo, pero Julieta Venegas se merece todo el exito obtenido por este disco, ""ANDAR CONMIGO"" ha sido su exito mÃ¡s fuerte en la radio, no se le puede acusar de tratar de comercializarse, por que ANDAR CONMIGO tiene su mÃ©rito, y no es cualquier canciÃ³n, solo por la inteligencia de este sencillo, el resto del disco es digerible y predecible, pero los temÃ¡s que se tocan son mÃ¡s profundos que el primer corte promocional, vale la pena darle una revizada a los dos trabajos anteriores que son tan bien muy buenos, en especial el sencillo SERIA FELIZ. Este disco vale la pena, porque es una latina con talento y agallas para cantar lo que siente."
3,"Watching True Blood the First, second, and now third seasons has gotten me hooked. I love the series so much and have finished the third season and now am watching the fourth season on my comcast account! amazing!"
3,"Love the third season....it was far more gory and gruesome than 1 and 2 (and so far 4). Of course there's going to be lots of blood, but it was a bit more raw. But of course still fantastic."
3,"I just can't help it. This series is so sleazy, but so fun. The third season was great. Loved all the twists and turns, and of course the sex and violence."
3,"Item shipped fast, and was packaged very nicely. I'm glad it shipped fast because my boyfriend had a thirst to watch yet even more true blood. It's a nice 5 disc set, and the disks are clean with no fingerprints."
3,"True Blood Season 3:The product came in the original packaging, which promptly arrived shortly after my purchase date. I am satisfied with my order through Amazon."
3,My mother loves this series. She couldn't wait to watch it after she opened it. It does not follow very closely to the sookie books
3,"The True Blood series gets better and better each year. I love the books, but love them coming to life even better. It's vampire love, humor and blood letting that begs you to return for more. Enjoy!"
3,Start with season one on video streaming. It doesn't stall and the story line goes pretty close to the books! PLUS it stays in my video library!
3,"Well, i know this may seem picky to some, but I was sent True Blood season 3 from Scandinavia or something. It has thse weird ratings on the back of the box, and its packaged in a blu ray box that is the same size of a regualr BR movie. All the discs are in their, it's just not the same as my True Blood season 1, and 2 boxes, you know like the fold out thing where each disc is separated from each other? I'm not sure why I was sent this version and not the US regular version, but I would have rather had the standard, fold out package. Oh well."
3,"Esther Kaplan is prescient. If this book had come out before the recent presidential election, and her thoughts had been widely diseminated, the American public would have a very different view of what was, in fact, happening in our country. On November 3, every democrat was running around screaming, ""how did this happen?"". Esther Kaplan already knew.The extent of intermingling between this administration and the hardcore right wing is novel, and bizarre, when one considers the dearth of media coverage on this very issue. Esther Kaplan gives the reader a map to who really controls this government and their plan. A must read."
3,I love Charlie Chan movies and I found the book to read much like the movies. The character still makes you smile. I really enjoyed the book and I am looking forward to reading some of Bigger's other books.
3,"just as represented, sturdy, right size for the job I had in mind. Easy storing in small area and not unsightly"
3,"I have this stroller for 2 months and so far I am pretty happy with it/I have used it in malls, airports,planes, beaches,parks /easy to use/easy to fold/good on bumby surfaces/stains come out/easy to carry/good 5-point harness/recline position is fine/small basket comes in handycanopy top is a bit flimsy but hey it is an inexpensive umbrella stoller.I plan on buying another to keep at Grandma's houseI bought this stroller in April 2005, it is now Dec 2006 and it is still in great shape!"
3,"As far as prequels are concerned, this is probably one of the best ones that came out this year! Kidding aside, it's a very entertaining book. It doesn't have the slow and steady rythm of the original Dune books, but then again it's not supposed to be like the original. First time readers would like it because of that reason while long time fans would be suprised to find something fresh and different. All in all, it still captures Dune's spirit of high adventure, Imperial court intrigue, ""wheels within wheels"" plot lines, and codes of honor and loyalty. A must read for old and first-time fans!"
3,"House Atreides is a thoroughly enjoyable read. The intrigue within the Houses of the Known Universe and the background of the Bene Gesserit's birthing program were fascinating. I thought the characters were well developed and reflected what they would become in Dune, if they survived that long. I learned more about what will happen in Dune by reading this book. I have already recommended this book to several people."
3,"I haven't read Dune in 10-15 years, but this prequel felt/read like the original to me. Dad would be proud."
4,"Sorry, but William Adams was not a trusted advisor of Tokugawa Ieyasu's, or even his friend. I've read two books on the subject, both bought at Amazon. Conrad Totman's book, for example, in page 104, states: ""He lived in Edo and was a shadowy figure whose path occasionally crossed Ieyasu's"", ""Ieyasu furnished them with simple homes and modest stipends in Edo"", ""Ieyasu found Adams helpful on occasion as interpreter"", etc.The novel and the series, however, are magnificent."
4,"What else is there to say? If one didn't like this candy, would they buy a case of 12 bags? The deciding factor obviously was price. Easily half what is paid at local chain drugstore."
4,I would say on many levels Child's Play works and for good measure since it all takes something from are childhood and turns it into a nightmare. Some say this is not scary aand to tell you truth if you just look at it it is not however (since I tend to think about movies)the idea of something trying to kill me and is hiding and im in a dark small apartment in chicago does. Thats how the movie works it dives into fears that we all have been through.However what does not work is something I ponder for a long time I feal that the writers at one point clearly wanted us to think it was andy doing all these killings and if they did they failed big time also if you are trying to do that dont put a doll waving a knife in the air(in other countrys specially europe they had just a case of the good guy doll)
4,"I saw this film when I was 10 years old and I don't remember getting much sleep afterwards. If you want a decent scare I'd recommend this film for it far outways the films that follow. This is a genuine thrill ride with state of the art effects and a creepy as hell plot. A murderer comes back as a doll and starts killing everyone. Brilliance. Too bad it could never be repeated, at least not effectivly."
4,what a great movie! this was one of the greatest horror flims i have seen in a long time! a cute inocent doll who suddenly turns psychotic is a great idea. when i first saw the movie i would not go near my dolls for 2 weeks. now thats my kind of horror movie.
4,"What a joy to wake up to birds singing! We already have an ""Indentiflyer"" and all the bird song cards for birds that live in our region.Birdsong Identiflyer Portable Audio Birdsong GuideWhen we saw this clock, made by ""Identiflyer"", I told my wife I wanted one. She put this in my Easter basket. (Yes, after 25 years of marriage, and even though the kids are out of the house, we still make up Easter baskets for one another.) I wake up to this alarm clock in the morning. I have the volume turned down because it can play very loud. (Some have left reviews saying this clock isn't very loud. Perhaps they have an older version...perhaps they need a loud, obnoxious alarm to wake them...perhaps they need to get to bed earlier so they don't sleep through their alarm!) I'm delighted with the clock. It's the best gift I've received in years."
4,recent African Grey owner and have read many books. Most appear factual but quite outdated. Best one yet !
4,I liked the selections and the renditions. The remastering was well done with the equalization set to emphasize the mid and upper mid ranges resulting in exceptional presence. A must for all Anita fans.
4,"Bill Bellamy performs original material. His topics include:Michael JacksonRappersCaliforniaWhite People NewsDogsAtlanta strip clubTaking a bath and oral sexHis humor uses the F-bomb, but unlike so many of his counterparts does not rely on it. What Bill failed to do was to ""bring it home"" with the big laugh at the end. Comedians normally try to end on a big laugh by using earlier material and connecting it to the final laugh."
4,"The dog boots I bought are ok, there is no water going into them,but I would like them to be more quiet while my dog is walking.Bye"
4,This album is much better than their first. The melodies are of a higher quality and the sound is really great. The song Dream is one of the best i have ever heard (and very good to send to a girl on a special day). You can hear very easily this album from the start to the end and relax. Its not too moody as their first album was. Great work. Recommended to all atmospheric metal fans and people who like something to chill out.
4,Bought this unit to try out a mapping unit after having 2 Garmins and a Magellan w/o maps and I must say I am impressed ! Battery life is triple that of my other units. Accuracy is just as good as my units that I paid twice as much for. The maps are pretty basic low to medium detail but I wasn't looking for high detail maps. I have mapping software for that. This unit has many more features than I expected and is a great buy for the money.
4,This book is cute for kids. My preschool students loved it. I would recommend it for anyone with kids or teaching kids
4,"I have enjoyed a lot of things in life and Terry has been one of the enjoyments. In fact, I believe I read Sword of Shannara before any of Tolkein. In the Wizard at Large, he continues the story and brings it to our world again. Excellently written for the adventurer."
4,"This is the second time I've purchased this particular product. Unfortunately, last summer one fell in the pool and that was the end of that. We live in a small neighborhood on a dead end street with lots of kids. When I send my kids down to play they attach this to their pants with the belt clip or put it in a coat pocket. When it's time to come home or I want to check up on them, I just give them a call on the radio. I also use it when my kids are sick. Their bedrooms are upstairs and if I'm downstairs doing laundry or working on the computer, they can just call me on the radio rather than yelling which isn't something they like to do when they are sick! Great for what we use it for."
4,"I grew up and live in Oklahoma. I got to see my first ""demonstration"" of Native American dance when I was in kindergarten and it left me wanting more. This type of dance has to be my favorite. It's not just people dancing to someone else's music or idea. These dances are about the people dancing them, their culture, their beliefs. To be able to look into their world is a great gift. I have to admit, I would be just as entranced even if they didn't have on their dance outfits but just wore their street clotes. The footwork is really amazing--especially considering that non of the dancers were taught in a professional studio but by generations of dancers before them. This type of dance is a treasure handed down from father to son, and mother to daughter.Watching the video, was like seeing history."
4,"With Street Raised,a dÃ©but novelist gives us a story that would fit in comfortably with the dirty realism of Richard Ford and Tobias Wolf, but also with classic a crime novelist like Elmore Leoanard. This is a mature, touching, exciting and complicated novel which will stay with you."
4,"I'm puzzled by the complainer from CT who can't run Tax Cut without Internet Explorer. The software doesn't require a web browser to run, though of course you need one to update it or get online help. I tried unloading IE and loading Opera. Then I loaded Tax Cut and clicked on online help. It connect to the Tax Cut website without any complaint. If there's a problem here, it may be with Netscape. I can't check, because I recently installed Netscape 7.01 and it won't connect to the web at all!"
4,"There is a reason that fans of P.C. Hodgell can be seen frantically scanning used bookstore shelves looking for the elusive copies of her books. They're amazing. The stories of Jame, her brother, and the other members of the Kencyr are enthralling and gorgeously written--the world they inhabit is one of the most original and complete in all sf/f and the stories themselves are complicated enough and fascinating enough for any reader. If you want enthralling characters, interesting background myths and some of the most lyrical writing anywhere..these are the books. plus, they DO have a sense of humor! This book, in particular, is wonderful because it brings together the first two in the (currently) trilogy and a few short stories that also take place in the same universe. A must for anyone--pick these books up and you won't regret it! They're wonderful!"
4,It took longer than usual for the item to arrive but when it did finaly arrive it was packaged well and the product was as advertisd. I will probably buy from this seller again.
4,"I purchased these filters with the understanding they had the black filter on one side, when in fact they did not. The picture used showed the black filter, but the product is different. I noticed they were 500/600 filters, not 501/601 filters...watch out if you need 501/601 filters!"
4,I loved this book as a child! So happy to find a copy here to add back to my book collection.Thanks Amazon seller!
4,"Disco espectacular para disfrutar con tus amigos tomando unos buenos tragos, se recominda un Jack Daniels. Acid jazz vertiginoso, con una calidad impresionante, de lo mejor del cuarteto Altamente recomendable para darte un gustazo o para quedar bien con alguna seÃ±orita"
4,"Broke my original pair that came with the knives, this pair of shears is even better. Great price."
4,I love these! My friend has a pair and I watched her use them while making dinner and realized I needed these! I use them for cutting all my vegetables super fast. I was a bit intimidated with taking them apart thinking that it was real involved but it isn't! Just presses back together and your all set to go! I would highly recommend these for anyone who works in the kitchen and likes to work fast!
4,"The second piece of italian based band Domine, following their debut album Champion Eternal,in the same trend of sound as Labryinth and Rhapsody (no need to add comments to that). It's a great heavy, epic, metal melodic album,look for pieces like ""The battle for a great Silver Sword"" & ""Mars, bringer of War""......if you're a lover of this epic metal sound and bands like Manowar, Rhapsody, etc, you'll find this CD it's just a great"
4,"When I came to this country years ago, I purchased an LP with several jazz singers and I immediatly became fascinated with Arthur Prysock's voice, so strong and melodious, that from that moment I became his best fan. I was a little disappointed because as I listen to the radio, very little is played of his music in most of the radio stations that I used to listen to. So now I have my own CD which I thoroughly enjoy. M. JONES"
4,"I came across this book by change when in the US and I am glad I bought it then. It made good reading on the long flight back home,Australia, and left me with a couple of thoughts about how languages change,evolve into new languages, etc. English from England has become a bit like Italian in Italy after the fall of the Roman Empire. Good old English is a long way away from what is spoken now in the US and Australia as well, and other parts of the world. Behind this fragmentation of English lies different cultural experiences as is clear from this usefulbook. I cannot help thinking that it would be very useful to have a similar book for the Australian language."
4,"Meg Ryan meets Tim Robbins and Einstein plays the matchmaker, abhorring the all so straight and boring professor played by the never than excellent Stephen Fry. The cast alone is enough to glue you to the screen, even though the remodelling of Tim Robbins is far from convincing and takes quite a bit of the film, as does Meg's infatuation with the new ""top I.Q.""This being a good old fashioned romantic comedy love triumphs, of course - and why should that be such a terrible thing?"
4,"I.Q. is a well-crafted comedy. Set in the 1950's, a young auto mechanic named Walter (Tim Robbins) falls head-over-heels in love with Catherine (Meg Ryan), the niece of Albert Einstein (Walter Mathau). As a mathematician, Catherine mistakenly believes that marrying her fiance, a psychiatric researcher, is a good idea because it will produce smart children. Uncle Albert would rather she follow her heart. He decides to launch a scheme to make Walter appear to be a brilliant scientist in an effort to convince his niece that Walter is a better choice. Needless to say, not everything goes according to plan."
4,"What I like about this movie is the lighthearted aspect of it. Tim Robbins and Meg Ryan were two of the most unlikely couple to get together. Walter Mathau plays a great Albert Einstein. I like how he had his friends involved in getting these two people together. Meg's fiance truly was a nerd and could never see the need of true love. Einstein wanted his niece to be truly happy and knew it would never happen if she married this idiot. Tim Robbins plays a wonderful genuis working as a mechanic. People have no idea how intelligent a person is. They only take them at face value. This movie is great in showing that intelligence comes in a variety of forms. For a wonderful lighthearted movie, I recommend this movie to anyone who still believes that love is always possible."
4,"This is a great ""little"" coloring book. I didn't realize it's size until it arrived, but the pictures are great, simple and attractive."
4,"John Cage worked in collaboration with Margaret Leng Tan (toy pf.) for several times. Tan is so good and successful at expressing Cage's magical world. ""The Seasons"" was originaly piano solo number and translated into orchestra version here. Like Vivaldi's (or Piazzolla's) 'Four Seasons', the color of the music differ from piece to piece. It really excited my imagination. ""Concerto for Prepared Piano(1951)"" and ""Suite for Toy Piano (1948)"" (Tan's second recording) are not avant-garde anymore, they can come into center in classical music scene. ""Seventy-four"" (which Cage wrote for American Composer Orchestra in 1992) is rather new piece and anyone who loves Part, Gorecki or Tavener will love this."
4,"My 8 year old son got this for a birthday present and absolutely LOVES it! I'ts important to get a METAL erector set (the lower priced sets are plastic - too ""little kid""). A great way to get your kids away from the TV and video games!"
4,"This toy is so cool. The day I got it I opened it up to find tons of pieces and instructions. I spent a lot of time just building the models that were in my head. This is sooo cool. If you buy this, you are NOT wasting you'r money."
4,"My son was absolutely thrilled with this erector set. He has built several of the models and he feels like he has the ""best Erector set in the world!"""
4,"We purchased this one to replace one that was about 30 years old. Was hoping it was as good as the original, and it is! It keeps coffee hot to the last cup. The handle on the side makes for easy handling and pouring. Does not need to be "" new and improved"" because the original is fantastic. Is large enough to hold coffee for the whole day, not just a cup or two for a commute."
4,"Fabric strength is sufficient (does not tear easily) and it appears to be good for its intended function, i.e. wrapping around perforated drain pipes to prevent silt from seeping in and plugging the pipes. I did not award 5 stars because I would have used a wider roll (6 ft would have been ideal) if it had been available. I buried the pipes in crushed stone and wrapped the fabric around the outside of the stone layer to allow for better drainage. At 24"" the fabric was not wide enough and so I had to overlap 3 runs for complete coverage. Other than that, very happy with the results. Drain worked great during last rain storm."
4,Definately the best Planet X album so far. Absolutely Stunning! Put on your headphones and get ready to travel the Universe! Derek Sherinian is the best keyboard player on Earth. The only drawback to this record is that the Great Allan Holdsworth should have had alot more playing time.
4,This is one of the best books I have read in years. I was hooked from the first page. It is obvious that Mary Blue did her research not only into the many pantheons of mythology but also into the subtle nuances of the dieties. She played upon them brilliantly. When one reads the acknowledgements it becomes clear that the suffering endured by the heroine Hope has been Ms. Blue's suffering as well. The adventures are authentic and fun. I've never been to Sturgis but I can really imagine what it must be like. The book begins in another realm but comes to earth and covers the country from east to west with gorgeous detail all the way. The characters are people I am sure I know! Her artistry at exposing the fractured mundane aspects of the seemingly deified and then shining a light on the divinty in all of us is touching. I hope she is planning a sequel.
4,"This album isn't a Pinkerton, but actually, this album has some characteristics similar to Weezer's 2nd album. For those who thought that Pinkerton was better than the Blue Album, I disagree, however, progression of an artist calls for an interesting response. Pinkerton did not do as well as it should have, and because it was an experiement. This album, is an attempt to keep sales alive, however, what we wont see from Weezer is any progression, for it was for the worse (sales wise) while some fans consider Pinkerton to be one of the best emo albums out there. Ok, anyway I'm off topic. This album is pretty pleasant, with only 1 or 2 tracks that seem out of the norm. The rest is just pretty much like the Green Album. It's good, but not great. A little better than the last album, but not much."
4,"Anyone who picks up this album will not be disappointed as it contains all the ingredients of a great rock record. Rivers and the boys bring all their talents together to create one of the best rock albums of the new millenium. With songs like burndt jamb, slave and fall together, there is no way you could not love this album. If you are not a weezer fan and love rock n' roll music just pick this album up and you will realize that it is the shiznit."
4,"This is a great cd. I love the fact that it is different from the green album. Death and Destruction is such a different song for the Weez and they pull it off beautifully. Possibility, Love Explosion and December are strong finish to an excellent cd, reminds me of the power last three on the Blue album. If this is your first Weezer purchase imediately order the Blue cd and Pinkerton. Weezer Rocks!!!!!!!"
4,"It's true too. Members went to HARVARD and graduated. But seriously people. I do not like to compair to previous albums but this album and the ""Green Album"" both capture the magic of the ""Blue Album."" POWER CHORDS GALORE! Melody, lyrical, harmonization, short and sweet. There isn't more I can say about this album except that you should support good rock and not the commercial B.S. Buy this album."
4,"Irreverent yet accurate, Mark Steele takes people who have made a mark in history (or at least are mentioned often enough that their names are familiar) and gives you the highlights of their lives in a way that makes you remember the important bits. If you are looking for fun and history at the same time, these lectures are worth your time and investment--still worth the investment if you are just looking for great laughs!"
4,"Three generations of the Giorgio family have been in the lobster business in Brooklyn. When the bank that had their restaurant renovation loan went under, the FDIC insisted on immediate payment--if not the place goes up for auction.Oh yeah, and it's Christmas.It's a great tale of a long-time family that struggles and survives, keeping their fight, their ingenuity and their sense of humor."
4,"This engaging summary propels readers through the epic story of how Western thought has evolved through the centuries. If you are new to philosophy, you will find that this book gives a lucid overview of subjects ranging from the early Greeks through the evolution of Christian thought, and proceeding onward through the Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution to current-day Postmodernism. This book gives many insights on the context underlying current-day views and assumptions about man's place in the universe. If you seek answers to existential questions or religious uncertainties, you may find the Epilogue wanting, but the book as a whole will intrigue you."
4,Comparing these knives to the rest of the available choices is unfair. They have great weight and balance and cut very well.
4,I thought that this movie was better than any of the Star Trek movies yet. We finally had a movie about the Romulans and the battles were amazing. I don't know why so many people ripped on this movie. Porbably the same people who destroyed Enterprise. So don't let them scare you away from such a great film.
4,"Nemesis(the word not the subtitle) usually means fate, destiny, or some cosmic reason, but in Star Trek Nemesis it's science that is the reason for the title.Picard must outthink his counterpart to save the crew,(typical), while Data discovers a new counterpart of his own.Through 2 reasons by the end of the movie 3 bridgecrew members are gone.Can You Guess Who?You Might Be Surprised!"
4,"Definitely an entertaining addition to the series of Star Trek motion pictures, my wife & I enjoyed it tremendously. I consider it 116 minutes of time well spent. -kd5-"
4,"This installment played for me much better on the small screen where the action sequences (which are a little exaggerated and maybe a tad gratuitous) don't overshadow and undercut the relationships and storyline for which I've always felt TNG excelled.Some have conerns about the storyline. I thought it was good enough to hold up the characters and I loved Tom Hardy as the evil Praetor Shinzon. He was a physically and mentally impressive and a capable ""nemesis"" to our beloved Captain Picard.Hardy takes away valuable screen time from some of our usual TNG characters, and the performances of Dr. Crusher and even Deanna seem perfunctory at best. I grew weary of Deanna's uncharacteristically sad, tear-stained face.Overall, it's a great TNG romp through the evil underbelly of the unknown and a showcase for good versus evil as well as Captail Picard and Data. Definitely worth seeing and a worthy film for your collection."
4,Excellent value for the money. Does its job. Has a rough feeling to it. I guess that's the way its supposed to be.Make sure you order the correct size. Luckily i did.
4,"These are BASIC work out gloves. Not the best design or feel but they do their job and are priced appropriately. (You get what you pay for.) If you're looking for something flashy and comfy; look else where. If you're serious about your workout and your money and want to protect your hands as well as your wallet; these are the ones.Secondly, GO BIG OR GO HOME applies here. They're made in China so they may be XL over there; but in the U.S. these are a size large at best. XL Fits me tight and I'm 5'11"" @ 195lbs with average hands."
4,"Great gloves for the price. I'm comparing them to a pair of cheapo neoprene gloves so these ones are definitely superior. Good materials that look like they're going to last for awhile. A barbell never twists in your palms with these as opposed to the neoprene gloves.Take care though that (like most others reviewers mentioned) these gloves are kinda tight. I've medium sized hands for my height (6'1""), and the large size I bought feels a little cramped. Just make sure to get at least one size more than you expect."
4,Thank you for this book. I learned a lot about memory loss and how to possibly prevent it without being overwhelmed with medical phraseology. I look forward to hearing more about the latest research in the cause and cure for Alzheimer's Disease.
4,"Battery works very well. I fall asleep with my wireless headphones every night, so they basically run out of charge every night. These batteries seem to last me about 1.5 years of this 'abuse'!Not much more to say than that. :-)"
4,"It's pretty hard to write a review of a battery; it either works or it doesn't. This one does. It also fits the unit for which it was intended. So that's two points right there.If you have a set of Senns, and the batteries that come with it aren't enough to keep you going (I actually find that they last closer to five hours than the four advertised), then this is the product for you. You might even want a recharging unit too, since they take at least fourteen hours to recharge, and the headset stand only holds two batteries. The spare battery can be crucial if you're like me, and often use the headset all day at work! Go for it!"
4,"Received the battery very quickly, in just a couple days, and it fits and works perfectly. Definitely would have my future business."
4,"This book was a huge surprise: it has everything in it a great children's book must have. The elements found in this book include:1. Counting. My son greatly enjoys how the numbers of Miss Muffet's visitors keep growing.2. Rhyming. One thing that really grabs my son's attention is rhyming. The rhyming in this book is very clever and definitely rivals Dr. Seuss's best works.3. Rhythm. This book is easy to read quickly. Not that the book is short, but that the words flow extremely well. As a result, even an 18 month old doesn't have time for attention to wander.4. Color. The illustrations are full of color and wonderfully illustrate the story. Looking at the pictures is as much fun as reading the story.5. Story. The story is interesting! My son is excited by each page every time we read the book.This book, on it's first reading, became one of my son's favorites. I even look forward to reading it!"
4,"I purchased this item to enhance the addition of a laptop to my family of computers. I got a Hawking Technology PC card to go with. Setup went flawlessly and I was networking in 30 minutes. And I may know my way around a computer but I'm no networking expert. I would highly reccomend this product for someone who wants to share one broadband connection but doesn't require the intra-computer file transfer be at a lightning speed that the ""G"" network would offer."
4,I HATE the way me ears 'burn' when using ear buds. The sound from these is great and ther are comfortable.
4,These earphones are wonderful! I have never had anything fit so comfortably in my ear. You don't know they are there. Set is light and just right for my usage. Walkman while doing yard work.Highly recommend.
4,"I adore these headphones. I have a number of issues when it comes to finding headphones I like.Firstly, I'm a distance runner so I need headphones that will stay in my ears for a long period of time. I hate having to fidget with headphones during a run so the more stable the better. Secondly, I have tiny ears which normal ear buds tend to fall out of.I've tried many different types of headphones but I keep coming back to these. I first got these headphones (or this style) probably 10 years ago with my CD player and I have yet to find a pair that better stay on my head and in my ears. The sound quality is great for what I use them for. Also, they are pretty resistant to sweat and weathering."
4,I have used similar models of this product for many years. They are light weight and the sound quality is excellent considering their costs. They are easy to store and unlike plug in ear buds will not easily fall out.
4,"Great sound, light weight, stays in place good when on the treadmill. I really like the quality of the overall headpiece. I am a little concerned about durability. The sound reproduction is great. Recommended for those who want an inexpensive headpiece."
4,SO I JUST RECEIVED THESE AND HOLY CHRIST THESE ARE THE BEST HEADPHONES I HAVE EVER GOTTEN IN MY LIFE!!!! THEY ARE LITERALLY FEATHERWEIGHT AND SO GD SNUG ITS UNFREAKINGBELIEVABLE LIKE COME ON IM LIKE TOOOOO IMPRESSED....SOUND QUALITY...ITS SONY NUFF SAID AND I BOUGHT THESE FOR RUNNING AND THEY STAY IN PLACE AND CAN'T BE BEAT!!!
4,"I love these headphones! After searching far and wide and being willing to spend up to $50 on headphones, I am happy to report that these inexpensive ones are the best of the bunch. Evidently, my ears are smaller than most people's because all other types of headphones I have tried hurt my ears after a half hour or so. These do not hurt my ears even after hours of wearing them. Plus they are lightweight and sound great.The only thing I don't like is that the cord seems too long, but that isn't a huge problem."
4,These are great headphones for those who don't like ear buds but still want to have lightweight flexibility. I use these with my IPOD during my workouts.
4,"This is an informative book to read, if only to be better informed about how the FORD ECU works. This won't make you a high performance tuner, but it is a great guide if you want to understand basic tuning procedures. Easy read, lots of good info."
4,"This is the main lens I used for so long, and now it is back focusing. I have had it for just over a year, and used it on many amateur photo shoots with great success! It was clear, super sharp, great colors, but now I can't use it at all. I will say though, for $99, I got more than my money's worth with this lens. The casing is cheap, but that doesn't affect the quality of the photos which is all I really care about. I am entertaining the idea of fixing this lens myself (as it would be more expensive to send it in for repairs) and if all else fails, I will probably purchase another. It was a great lens and I loved it so much!"
4,"Very likable crisp and clear image - f/1.8 is more than enough for me. One thing I found weird is that when it is on manual focus, the photo does not always come out as expected. Auto focus works fine though - I guess I will just stick to AF - nothing much you can ask for for a lens this cheap."
4,AMAZING LENS FOR IT'S PRICE.WHERE ELSE CAN YOU FIND A LENS THAT TAKES INTENSELY SHARP IMAGES WITHOUT BREAKING THE BANK NOR TAKING THE WIFE FIRST TO SEE HER FAVORITE RELATIVES ON ANY GIVEN DAY? LOLZOK...DON'T THINK TWICE OF GETTING THIS LENS. IT WAS NOT BUILT LIKE A TANK BUT IT WILL GET YOU THERE....AND FOR THE PRICE??? MY CAR'S WEEKLY GAS CONSUMPTION IS WAY MORE THAN THE PRICE OF THIS AMAZING LENS.700+ POSITIVE RATINGS ON AMAZON...I WILL LEAVE IT ALL TO YOU!
4,"Great Lens! I wish it was Image Stabilized, but for the price, I can't complain. I Guess it is plastic and somewhat cheaply made, but that doesnt bother me since I like the light weight of the lens for carrying and I tend to take care of my lenses.Over all, A Great Lens!! A must-have for my Rebel T1i"
4,"Great little lens for the money ... I got it for the price. Shots are above average compared to others in same price range. However, beware, it's pretty much a plastic lens... the housing feels very cheap and quality in build but just be careful when you are traveling or waking around with it. Actually it's so cheap in price, if it does break just buy another one. But I know Canon will honor any issue with it. I recommend this buy"
4,My boyfriend is into photography and this was a gift for him. He loved it! This lens does exactly what he wanted it to do. The lens takes great pictures. I am glad I purchased this for him.
4,"Until I got the 50mm f1.4 as a gift, this was my favorite and most-used lens. I found that shooting with a really fast lens like this takes some getting used to as it is very easy to not perfectly focus on exactly what you want as the DOF is so very shallow, but this is a great lens. The fact that it is so cheap is telling though. It takes great images, but this is not a lens you can be at all careless with. You have to be careful with all lenses, but in all the time I have been doing photography (20+ years) I've never had a lens as fragile as this one. The first one I had fell off a low table onto a rug and it was destroyed. The second one was pulled out of a camera bag by a pet and rolled a few feet across the floor and it was also dead.If you want a fast, sharp lens and don't want to or can't spend a lot of cash, buy this lens. Just treat it as though it were a Ming vase."
4,"This is a great lens. I is very small and light but is sharp and fast. It is plastic but it does not feel ship, is just light. If you got the kit lens you must buy this lens and it will probably become your main lens. You can get great boken with this lens an at 50 mm is a great portrait lens in the XTi."
4,"Awesome lense, took a little to get shipped but it was well worth the wait. The one issue I noticed was a what looks like a small scratch or black spot inside the lense. I tried cleaning but it's definitely unreachable without taking it apart. The good this is that it does not affect the picture at all. So far I've taken dozens of photos and all come out with the great quality that this lense delivers. A must have. in my opinion."
4,"What a great lens for the money! If you are searching for an affordable f1.8 portrait lens, then search no more. The images are clean and sharp and the shallow depth of field is amazing and just what I was looking for. The auto focus works fast and I have not had any issues with the lens. True, it's not a telephoto lens which means you have to move your feet. But it sure beats the $1,700 price tag of my f2.8 70-200 lens. Don't get me wrong, I love that lens too and it has it's place during weddings, but this 50mm lens has become my prime portrait lens."
4,This lens has to be one of the most 'value for money' profile lens on the market for canon users.The clarity is really good! and the pictures that come of this camera are priceless!good buy!
4,"I just ordered one of these upon seeing what my friends have been doing with this particular lens.If you're just starting out with photography, or are on a budget this lens is definitely worth the price. At $75-$100 USD, you literally will not get anything better without paying around 4x the price. Images are a little soft when wide open (but still very nice) and sharpest at f/8 (beats out some very expensive lenses at that point). The only problem you might have is with the plastic build of the lens, but at $100 or so, you'll probably get your moneys worth out of it."
4,"That's the best canon lens for the money. Sharp, with nice colors and decent bokeh. My only complaint is lack of IS and sometimes inaccurate AF. But for this price you will not find a better lens."
4,"It is a good product, the shipment was on time without problems the product was in good conditions. The lens is just like you can see on the web."
4,"The nifty fifty is an excellent lens that I highly recommend.However, I do not recommend Adorama. Long story short - they ripped me off. Lots of vendors out there without needing to use Adorama."
4,"This lens is an amazing value for the price, considering its fast 1.8 aperture. DSLR users should be aware that because many DSLRs use non-full frame sensors, the focal length will be multiplied by a factor listed with the camera specs. For example, my Canon Digital Rebel XTi magnifies the focal length by 1.6x, resulting in an 80mm effective focal length, even tho it is rated at 50mm. This limits this lens, in my case, to being either an excellent and versatile portrait lens, a somewhat useful macro lens (with appropriate filter to reduce minimum focus distance), or a very short, long lens.I love this lens for its price and its speed. It was definitely worth the $, and is a great lens for specific uses."
4,"this is a great lens for the price.it blurs the background very nicely,and is able to take great photosin dark places.i recommend this to anyone wanting to buy a lens with a limited budget."
4,"On the one hand, this is a great lens for the money. I'd blow off the crummy zoom that ships with the kit Digital Rebel XT and buy this one instead. I use it for 80% plus of my family pictures, with my Rebel XT APS-sized sensor it's a compact portrait lens.On the other paw, I dropped the camera. The lens might have hit first. The next day it wouldn't come off the camera. I forced it off (bad move) and found the inner ring of the lens had broken. This prevented the lens from full disengaging. My forcing it off may also have damaged the camera, though at this time the one retracted contact pin is again working and the camera seems to have survived.So .... there's a downside to cheap build quality other than the lens itself coming apart. It could damage your camera.Bottom line, don't put this on a >$1000 body. I bought another because I didn't have time to shop, but I think I may end up getting the 1.4 instead."
4,"This is the best lens you can get for $100. Using the fixed 50mm is so great. I am not pro or even amateur yet, but this lens allowed me to step up my game. My next lens will cost $800 or so, since the quality of this just makes me want to buy L-series if it is truly that much better."
4,I absolutely love this lens. For $90 you can't go wrong and the pictures are just what I wanted. Nice and clear with the required depth of field and nice blurring in the background.
4,"As a neophyte in the video DSLR field, this was my first purchase moving away from the kit lens. It is a very sharp lens, great picture and awesome dof. Definitely an outstanding purchase for the price and quite frankly don't know why you wouldn't buy this lens if you had any kind of budget at all. It does feel like a toy, light, cheap plastic...wouldn't want to drop it on the pavement...that is for sure. But if you did...it less than $100.00, so the heartache is minimized. I use it more than the kit lens as I think it produces a sharper picture. Again, if you are starting out, have a budget, can't afford all the cool stuff, this would be your lens!"
4,"zooms all your shots really far in, not great for video (it has a really hard time focusing). We end up keeping this on our camera all the time now"
4,"I bought this lens with my new Canon Rebel XT. It was recommended by one of my friends and I thank him very much for letting me know this beauty. It works very well for indoor portrait shooting and I got quite some nice photos for my baby.Only one thing worries me a bit. It doesn't look like it is going to hold on for a long time. But with $70 something as the price, I know I should't expect too much."
4,"I bought this for my girlfriend and she can't get enough of it. One of her comments was ""this lens opens up a whole new world of photography for me"" I have also used the lens a few times and while it takes some getting used to, once you do its hard to put it away.So amazing lens from Canon, great purchase!"
4,"I have been waiting for a new single since '98! I knew Hanson would be great, they always have been, I just didn't expect them to be AMAZING! ""This Time Around"" proves, for those of you who didn't already know, that Hanson are magnificent songwriters and have many talents; they get better with each passing day. If your looking for a great, new song....buy this single and mark your schedule for May 9!"
4,"This Time Around (the song, not the albium) is not about what music today seems to be about (ie- touch me here, touch me there; oh baby oh baby; yeah [read that like the girl from ""ten thing i hate about you: really bland and dry]) The first verse, is actually about war. (listen to me carefully now-->) This song has a very inspirational message behind it, infact it really reminds me of the story behind ""Hero"" by Mariah Carey-- although it sounds nothing like it. If you like REAL music (ie-- real instruments and real musicians on a track) you'll love This Time Around.Take Hanson for what they are: musicians. Nothing More, nothing less. This Time Around proves that with an ""in your face"" attitude."
4,"Although, still holding on to their teeny-bopper image and style, their sound is becoming more mature. Voices have changed, melodies have become more complex, but they still hold on to their brotherly harmonies that made their sound on their first couple albums. Jonny Lang's performance is hidden because of the nature of Hanson's music, but a nice listen-to, anyways."
4,"I can now understand why Kanye won that race between himself and 50, have you heard this album!!! Its hot, ""good morning"", ""stronger"", ""good life"", ""everything i am"" and my favorite song of all ""homecoming""!!!!! HOT. You can really bounce to these!"
4,"I haven't been much of a Kanye fan. This is actually the first CD I purschased of his. I'm not even going to try and compare Kanye vs. 50 because I feel that they are just two different types of music. I was really feeling the song ""stronger"" and decided with all the hype I would check out his CD. Definelty worth buying. All the songs are good and you find yourself listening to the complete album without having to skip most song, like I find myself having to do for so many other artisit.So putting aside Kanye's full of himself attitude, which I can careless for, the album is still worth buying."
4,This was the sickest album I have ever heard. OMG! I'm about to go and listen to it again. This IS the hottest album of 2007. Every song is a 5 star song! Once again Mr.West didn't dissappoint. This album made all 3 of his albums the College Trifecta of Perfection.
4,We all know this cd was one of his best! Love me some Kanye! He brings it every tme and I thank him for it!
4,"This is a pretty impressive album. I was rooting for 50 but you simply can't deny that this album has life to it. Hip hop probably did die in the late 90s with Biggie and the last few imitators who followed. I can't help but feeling that 50s album just followed the same tired rap album formula. As for Kanye's album, it simply defies any genre. It's not really rap, not quite pop. It's just very original and fun to listen to. There are some really powerful songs on this album. I would recommend this refreshing album."
4,"Very nice album. It isn't like College Dropout, which is a future classic, sort of like Jay-Z's Reasonable Doubt. Kanye has a different swagger on this album, and the production is great. The whole album is like an experiment, but it worked out better than Late Registration, his sophomore album. All the tracks were amazing, probably except Barry Bonds, featuring Lil Wayne. Drunk and Hot Girls is also not as great, but I'm growing on it and the sample is getting to me.Hot album, definetly worth buying."
4,Great Album....It has not left my CD player since the day I bought it. Kanye is back and this album proves it.
4,I've had my iRiver IFP-790 for a couple of years. I use it to play my Old Time Radio shows. The Music Manager is a breeze to use and I've never had a bit of trouble with the unit or the software. It has a true resume feature which is a must for OTR. It picks up exactly where you left off when you power down.Sound quality is great.I'm sold on iRiver quality!
4,"Regular size tights must be made for skinny short people because I am average size and a large regular costume tight never had enough material to make it all the way around my bottom and would slip down the entire time I was wearing them. The 1X in these tights, although a little big, had plenty of room and do not constantly roll up or down and are very comfortable. These went great with my Alice costume"
4,This battery has allowed me to do some filming without the need to plug the camcorder in all the time. I can go for hours between charges.
4,"I learnt lots of these poems as a child in school - perhaps I had a teacher with a wicked and somewhat warped sense of humour! And I have never forgotten how wonderful they are. My personal favourite is about poor Jim, who gets into so much trouble, but the others are equally delightful.These gleefully moral tales are never out of date. Children will be naughty, and a good rhyme has a timelessness of its own. Share them with your own children and be amused together!"
4,"this is the only pentagram album i have, and because this is one of their latter ones, you can understand that i am not a huge expert on them. this record is still probably one of my favorite doom albums, mixing perfectly the rocking parts, grooving moments, and all out doom. there isn't a lot to say, Bobby's vocals are completely awesome, and some of the riffs here are completely, udderly great. get it if you like doom metal."
4,This stanley food bottle is perfect for him when he goes to work. He puts chili in it mostly but it works great for other foods as well. He had one that didn't keep his food hot and by lunch it was cold. This one he says works great and he loves it! He puts hot water in it for a few mins to get it extra hot before he puts his food in there!
4,"I purchased this product in April 2009 on Amazon for $79. At that price this is an excellent kettle, very convenient to use and heats up water fast. Comfortable handle, does not spill when pouring, overall its well designed as could be expected from a german design (it's made in Czech Republic though). I use it to make french press coffee and for this a kettle is so much more convenient than heating water on the stove.However, as I'm writing this review I see that the price has gone up to $199 which I can say this product is definitely not worth. It is a premium product compared to the $20-$30 kettles I've seen but not that much premium. So, at $79 it's a no-brainer but at $199 it's rip-off, simply put."
4,"I had this kettle for about a month and have been very satisfied with it. I use it at work, and have it right on my desk. No smells, it's quick, takes up very little space, and is fairly atractive.I gave it four, rather than five, stars because it's a little larger than I'd like, I would have perfered all stainless steel, and the cord is about 2"" too short to reach a power strip on the floor when placed on a typical desk."
4,"My wife and I are frequent tea drinkers, so we like having hot water on-hand all the time. We initially bought an Asian electric boiler with auto-reboil, but it ended up costing us an arm and a leg in electricity bills due to its poor insulation and constant re-boiling.Recently we found the Braun AquaExpress and haven't looked back since. It's extremely fast and eliminates the need to boil water ahead of time. It also looks great on our kitchen counter, and the construction seems very sturdy and reliable. Highly recommended!"
4,"We had the same Kettle while we lived in Europe. We were very satisfied with it but couldn't bring it to the US because of the different electrical system in the US. When we found it on Amazon we were very pleased and bought it right away. The Braun Kettle is the best electric kettle we have ever had. It's cordless, boils water fast, it's light weight and it's beautifully designed. I can recommend this product to anybody who wishes to have a Electric Water Kettle."
4,"i got this yesterday, and the only real problem i found was the fact that it had no built in light for night shootingi got a mini led mag light thoughworks just as well"
4,The book was delevered promptly and in good condition. I am very pleased with my order.thank youmichael
4,"Wow. This is one of the best Melodic Death Metal Albums I've heard ever. APP is Soilwork's 3rd release. I think soilwork's musical career if graphed, makes a mountain with this cd being the peak. It went uphill to this then downhill after this unfortunatly...But anyway about the album. The first song, Bastard Chain sucks you in and doesnt let go untill the cd is over. There is not one dull song. APP combines the perfect amount of elements needed for a good melodic death metal record...speed, musicianship, melodic vocals and leads, a technical yet musical drummer and solos. This cd portrays each of those and does it well. Nice work Soilwork...now if only you would have stayed like this...Best Song: NeedlefeastOne Word Review: Innovative"
4,"A British meterological station is in danger, and those staffing it will soon be dead without help. An American nuclear sub is sent out to help them, along with a doctor that is an expert in the sort of afflictions they may have developed.However, this American sub also has an underlying spook mission to go along with the rescue. This hidden agenda causes a hell of a lot of problems and casualiies throughout."
4,"We are very happy with the iLuv dvd player. The only thing we would change is that we would like to be able to watch the ipod videos on a television connection through the dvd player, but that doesn't seem to work. However, we would definitely buy this product again!"
4,A good movie designed to let people know a little about gang life although there was a little too much fictionalization in the story. It ended up being very misleading and caused the death of several people.
4,This is a great musical for the whole family! Timeless classic that I've been watching since I was a kid.
4,"An absolute classic, everyone should own this movie.Literal laughs and tears story."
4,"I bought this DVD as a present and I haven't seen it myself,so can't review it, though I have had very favourable feedback from the recipient who enjoyed it immensely."
4,"Music, problems for a family and community, and changing times in the world make up the plot of this very enjoyable story."
4,"I consider that this film must won an Oscar Prize. It is fascinating with regards to: - Music - Actor (The father) - The dances I have seen this film many times and every time I shiver when I see it. It's so meaningful. It's not only a question of Jews and Russains. It's a social problem that may occur in family whether they are eastern or western families. Marriage of girls all over the world is a problem and parents are always after marrying their daughters and don't worry that much about son's marriage. It also deal with parents' love, money problem and how in some countries marrying young to old rich men seems to be solving poverty problem regardless of happiness or unhapinness of marriage itself. It also deals with Jews versus Russians an item that I am not up to discuss. But in my humble knowledge it deals with misery that happened to the jews."
4,"If you like musicals, you'll love Fiddler. It's a story of a Jewish community in Czarist Russia, and their lives and trials told in rich songs: ""If I Were a Rich Man,"" ""Sunrise, Sunset,"" ""Tradition,"" and many more. The story revolves around a peddlar, is wife, and three of their daughters. The matchmaker finds husbands for them, except the daughters have other ideas. The play ends with a sad exodus forced by a pogrom, but the peddlar refuses to give up, and carries on despite it all. END"
4,"The Bottom Line:Fiddler on the Roof is really long and plays as such sometimes, but the movie looks gorgeous, is acted well, and offers spirited renditions of songs that most of us know by now: recommended to musical-lovers and normal people alike."
4,"This DVD is of Conway's 1982 Mississippi river boat tv special. The sound quality is very nice, though parts of the 90 minute special were edited out like, Conway playing baseball with Barbara Mandrell, in fact her name is mentioned on the box, and Conway singing his latest hit at the time ""We Did But Now You Don't"" and there were some more songs sung, I remember, by Jerry Lee Lewis and Charlie Pride but this is a very nice DVD to have in any fan's collection."
4,"Book arrived in reasonable amount of time. Good condition. Some highlighting but was able to use for my class. Good price, too!"
4,"""Still Got The Blues"" is stand-out wonderful. Gary Moore is obviously one of the great rock-blues guitarists of our time. With great tone, fiery runs, sensitive phrasing, and intensely passionate playing, Gary breathes new life into my stereo speakers. He is in the same talent league as Stevie Ray Vaughn. What a delightful discovery this CD was."
4,"Reading this book on my daily commute certainly stirred up an appetite by the time I reached my destination!The colourful speech and frank tone of Kitchen Confidential is also present in this book, and still very entertaining. However, I found the book more like a collection of short stories than one continuous piece, as it jumped from country to country, and sometimes back to a previous country.There's some discussion of the culture that surrounds the food, but it certainly doesn't have the detail that he provided about professional cooking.My favourite aspect to this book is the flair and passion for describing food, done so well with imaginative descriptions that I feel like I can almost taste it. If restaurant menus were all written with such expertise, I'd by hypnotized into always eating out!"
4,"The book arrived in a timely fashion and was in pristine condition. Great price, too. Thanks."
4,"If you hate DVDs being made with bad lighting, poor audio or scripts that put you to sleep the YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE THIS DVD! Gary Katz demistifies many of the problems with todays carpentry. He shows specific tools and brings in guest speakers that are the inventors of those tools! You absolutley cannot go wrong with Gary's DVDs!If you have not made the investment yet, click the buy it now button and get them on their way!!!RobSchramm's Remodeling"
4,"while not so much the fault of the disks themselfs but rather the -rw format itself. You may find earlier (older) dvd drives including set top boxes will not read this format.i use -rw's more for replay on the burner then for use on set top boxes, or for sending to family and friends. Using them to get the format and feel then burn to a -r disk. This is the most availble brand and is recomended for most inhouse uses. I find the -r the most compatable, and the +rw format the least."
4,"I do highly recommend this product for dogs with any arthric pain,I do the method of 3 caspules a day for a 55 pound dog,I will stay on this does till I see physical changes in a dog,less limping/easier getting up persay,at this point when I do see less limping/easier getting up up to 75% at least I then will lower dosage to 2 capsules a day,when and if I see even better results I then will go to a steady dosage of 1 capsule a day,,,,though if limping/difficulty getting up increases,I will jump back up to 2 capsules a day,the dosage will always depend on how well the dog is doing,when their are NO benefits with this product it is absolutely a trip to the vets for further testing,,you can always go up to 4 capsules a day also and then start lowering dosage till your dog is 100% where they are happy/less pain,,,but needless to say if your dog is not getting better please seek the advice of your Veterinarian,best of luck."
4,"i luv this book because it was bout Madison helping out at the animal clinit and she did have alot of fun during her everytime visit. <with Sugar> =P Was having a little mad times when Egg's<Walters> was late for the extra-credits project that the teacher assign they were partners, but the end it turned out FINE.I also likes this book because it was the first book i got and then i started to like reading Madison Finn! =D"
4,"This game is endlessly amusing and super easy for almost everyone to play. All the details are super delightful, from aquiring 'young 'ens' to getting a 'rig' and getting married (and divorced and remarried) the options are endless, you'll never have the same journey twice. The game even offers suggestions on different ways to play and an expansion pack which offers even more options. By far the best game I've purchased, I reccomend it to anyone who wants a laughter filled, light hearted evening."
4,"This collection of Christian favorites will not only stir your memories, from your childhood right up to now, but is a good inspiration builder. Compiled by Readers Digest, you take a nostalgaic road back along the pathways of the the earlier part of your life, when you learned and probably sang most of these melodies. And if you haven't listened to most of these yet, you must still be young !!"
4,"We've been using this DVD for 5 years now - all 3 kids love it - grownups will think it is cheesey, low-tech but kids have fun dancing to it and learning all the silly move."
4,"I have admired Rocio Durcal since I was a child. However, Caricias is the first cd of hers that I have purchased. I had been unable to listen to her music for a number of years and Caricias was the cd which reintroduced me to Rocio's stunning voice. From start to finish, this cd takes you on an incredible emotional journey. Rocio speaks to your heart and shares the emotions she feels while singing each individual song. This cd is a must for anyone who appreciates beauty and who can relate to the summits and valleys which are experienced when one falls in love or is betrayed etc... since purchasing this cd, I have purchased several others."
4,"I kept 3 editions of this important title. No doubt on its authoritativeness. This new 2001 edition caught my immediate attention when I first saw it. I browsed thru it nearly from cover to cover. There are some newer entries not listed before (the 1984 ed), e.g., tiramisu. However, information on other cuisines is brief, e.g., only 2 pages on Spanish cuisine. For a serious cook like me who own 100+ cookbooks, this title is not essential. But, if you haven't yet owned previous editions, this is not a bad idea."
4,"Jeannie St. Marie tells a very entertaining, poignant, and personal story -- her real life experiences with John Denver. A must read for anyone desiring an inside look at the mega-star's intimate side. Jeannie's conversational and down-to-earth writing style makes you feel as if she's right in your own living room. Through her eyes, I've come to a new level of appreciation for John's beautiful musical works and his passionate spiritual service to our world. Many John Denver facts and reference sources are also included."
4,"After reading the reviews about this book, I ordered this book from Amazon.com. I received it and riped into the box to get it out. Actually, my wife stole it from me, but I got it back. I am about to be a new dad and I loved this book. It was funny, gave real life tips and made me want to read it from cover to cover. The book shows a dad with a tool belt filled with everything he will need for his baby, but I think this book was left out of the belt. It is awesome!!!!"
4,"My Husband was not one to read the typical 'Daddy' books. Handed him this one and he couldn't put it down. Our son is 6 months old and my husband is still referencing it. Fair warning ladies, he gives me advice and suggestions on how to do things and prefaces it with ""Well, my Daddy book says...""! Good buy, I would definitely recommend it because while he gives me unwanted advice sometimes at least he is involved enough to care to give that advice!"
4,My husband actually enjoyed reading this book. It's really quite funny and also full of useful information. Definitely worth picking up.
4,"If you're looking for a simple how-to, with very little frills, this is your ""new dad"" book. It's got amusing pictures throughout for entertainment value, and the information is concise and accurate on most fronts.If you're looking for a scholarly work, you'd do best to look elsewhere. For those who want a quick low-down on any number of parenting issues, this book fits the bill quite nicely."
4,"Jeff Goldblum......you should do more comedies!Steve Zahn........you funny dudeSalma hayek....what a gorgeous creature you are!Elijah Wood......definitely do more comedies!This movie is a rare gem. Watch this if your sense of humour isa little odd and you want to see the stars above shine like you've never seen them before.........oh, and for Michael Rappaport fans, his cameo half way in the film is unmissable."
4,"While slow, the first season had a good story arc. It still struggled with ""finding itself"". By the third season, the characters were well developed, but the episodes got increasingly inconsistent and it became even more clear that the producers and writers had no idea where this thing was heading. The end result is a show that occasionally lurches around, sometimes going wildly off plot, then back again. In spite all those problems, it still a very good show with some brilliant moments."
4,"This show worked pretty well as both as romance and sci fi. It didn't do them both at the same time though. Around half of each season focused on the romance and the second half on the sci fi.The second season has the most sci fi adventure, with numerous interesting and sometimes shocking plot turns. Everytime I thought I knew where this show was going I eneded up completely surprised.The special thing about this show was the way in which I was drawn into the lives of the characters. I really cared about them and was sorry to see the series end."
4,I enjoyed this movie. I especially enjoyed their take on Abraham's relationship with Isaac. And the scene of his willingness to sacrifice Isaac.
4,"This is great at making toast - what a concept! The toaster is a bit larger than most two slice toasters, but it is a clean and handsome design. The controls are straightforward, effective, and intuitive, with a solid feel to them. The results are very consistent. The bagel setting lets you tap a button right after pressing down the bread lever and it reduces the power to the outer toasting elements and lights up an indicator lamp. The inside of the bagel, English muffin, or whatever is then toasted to perfection without scorching the outer crust."
4,"This is an extremely well-written, insightful and poignant piece of writing about one of the greatest cities in the world. Anyone who has ever lived, or wanted to live in New York should read this book... however ... the title is extremely confusing! I was recently on vacation in Seattle and picked up this book in a bookstore I happened to stroll into, thinking it would help me find my way around downtown Seattle! I was halfway through chapter 3 before I figured out what was going on!"
4,"This is a great book, but you should know that, as far as I can tell, it is EXACTLY the same as Lomonico's Shakespeare 101 published by Gramercy Books the same year as this title. I don't know why neither of the listings here indicate this, but it's true. Don't buy it twice!"
4,"While I'm not 100% convinced that Marx was a Satanist, this book has some great quotes and letters proving what an evil person Marx was. I'm also pretty sure that he was in some sort of underground society, maybe not Satanism, like Freemasonry that guides the way the world goes. Nothing else would really explain his enduring popularity and his ideas being continually pushed to the fore front of our culture and education even after all these years, and all the proven horror and failure that is Communism.Any economic system based on government force and coercion instead of freedom of choice is bound to bring on gross human rights violations as has been seen where ever Marxism has been applied. It really worries me that this is still such a popular philosophy being force fed to our high school and college students."
4,"I believe strongly that educating yourself about cancer is one of the best ways to prevent it, treat it, and make it less scary. This video taught me a lot. First, it reminded me that we aren't out of the woods yet. Cancer is still deadly, though many people are surviving (myself included). The video talks a great deal about fears of death and the attitude one must take about cancer. Can you be fighting cancer and still be well? I believe you can. I will be adding this video to my library and plan to share it with the college students I teach."
4,"I owned the vinyl LP of this album for years and played it to death. Except for ""Wig-Wam Bam,"" I liked all the tracks. It was especially good to hear some of their early hard rock songs. It also includes some very interesting songs like ""Man From Mecca"" and ""Spotlight"" that transcend the typical heavy style. And ""YNWFLM"" is a beautiful CSNY-style ballad. The one strange thing about this re-issue is that they included the LIVE version of ""Need A Lot of Lovin'"" from ""Strung Up"" instead of the studio version my LP had. The bubblegum bonus tracks are OK if you wanted to hear what they sounded like before they ""grew up."""
4,"For those who want designs for flowers this book has many wonderful ideas to follow, I am sure that I will be using it often."
4,"This book is one of the best on the subject of mold and what to do about it. I have purchased other books on the same topic, but frankly they didn't impress me much. And after I finished reading them I felt like they hadn't really been helpful.But this book was a pleasant surprise. It's a quick read, and it's interesting. The author is knowedgable, and a certified and registered mold inspector. He provides very specific and practical information to the reader.I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for good, helpful information on the subject of mold and how to deal with it."
4,"Just like the original. get it. However mine said Ultrasonic, which is not shown in the picture. Lame but oh well."
4,"I did.I found it very amusing, and not a serious story it was laughable. I like your books, this was very good. I read forever first like I hope everyone else who read this book took the time to do the samething.So Jude, now, don't let a little bad press, stop you from writing about how she finds her husband, and where is her Daddy? what happen to Lincoln? It was a cute story, but you have to do your thing on the next book cause I know how to be a disagreeable reader as well as next person. So Write away, Jude , Write away."
4,"I've had this for a few years and everything I've made from it has been delicious! My husband and I aren't vegetarians, we just prefer to limit our intake of meat to once a week or so. This is a useful resource to have in the kitchen."
4,"This television production is family entertainment at its zenith. Perhaps best suited for girls (my daughters take turns pretending they are Vickie, the lead character), although both my three-year old son and I love it as well.Tightly constructed moralistic tales, interesting characters, solid acting, gorgeous scenery (New Zealand), sentimental music and a terrific horse. 4+ stars from a picky person."
4,"This printer is easy to set up and use and produces striking results with Photoshop, but it drinks ink by the gallons. I am able to get less than 20 11x17 prints from a set of cartridges that cost about $100. I think there is an option to use less ink and of course you can set the quality lower than ""best"" but for the work I do it isn't worth the risk. Apparently HP has come out with a pigment based printer that uses less ink."
4,"I've had this printer for several years now. I bought it (at an incredible bargain price) refurbished, which worried me at first. But it has turned out to be a super performer.The (photo) print quality is very good, and the large format images are impressive.On the down side, you start to realize you (and other people) don't have the wall space for too many tabloid or B-size prints. And framing is expensive.Also, I like the fact that this is a network printer, but the print drivers stopped working after a year or so (reinstalling them is on my to-do list). I can still use it by reading media cards directly from the printer.I have printed over 100 large (12x16"" or larger) photos, and countless smaller ones. The ink does last reasonably long, but a big print is going to cost you probably $3 or more in ink, plus the paper. But it's well worth it."
4,"On the splendid visual backdrop of turn-of-the-century India, 'A Passage to India' is a timeless and classic masterpiece of English literature, poetically exploring relations between rulers and subjects, men and women, Englishmen and Indians. Forster's lucid style and unsurpassed technical ability comes together in a carefully crafted and delicately balanced work. With great sensivity and sincere love of the country, he conveys to the reader the full emotional spectrum of the cultural mosaic of India, from the most deeply felt pious devotion to various religious duties, to the unfathomable chasm of misunderstanding between natives and colonial rulers. On an higher impersonal level, Forster weaves an exact and finely constructed plot with almost supernatural undertones, as if the characters are drawn imperceptibly and unknowingly towards their fates by forces within the land itself"
4,"It's a quiet but intense movie showing the spread of a killer virus with what seems like realism. The infection spreads at a believable rate with consequences that are predictable but understated. The science aspect was fascinating as well as the bureaucratic maneuvering you'd expect in government agencies dealing with an epidemic. Mostly it is a study of how various people respond to the spread of the disease. Not the action/science fiction you might expect from the title, more of a science/drama taking place on the set of a PBS documentary. Great performances, amazing direction. And it was fun to see Demitri Martin in a serious role."
4,"I'm a disaster movie junkie, so when I saw the trailer for this movie on television, I pre-ordered it from Amazon and waited anxiously for it to arrive. Amazon was able to ship it a bit earlier than I'd expected, which I greatly appreciated, and my husband and I settled in with our popcorn and started the movie with great anticipation. I won't spoil the movie for someone else who may have not yet watched it...I'll just say that although I did enjoy the movie, it was not what I expected."
4,"Changing Habits is a great vehicle to show the superb talents of actress Moira Kelly. She shows all facets of her acting ability from being mad, sad, hate and love throughout the movie. It is an excellent movie to see how a person can come about 180 degrees and it also gives us all hope and faith."
4,"This CD captures all of the big moments of the New York Yankees historic 1998 season, and even throws in a few 'jock-rock' type of tracks in between radio clips. It includes John Sterling from WABC making all of his classic play-by-play radio commentary...including his famous quotes like ""It is high...it is far...it is GONE!"", and of course ""The Yankees win...THHHHHEEEEE YANKEES WIN"". This CD is a treasure for any New York Yankee fan."
4,"I've used this for ~6 weeks now, and have no complaints. The ""clip-on"" model I have sits quite snug under my seat, is large enough for everything I like to have on hand, and doesn't interfere with pedalling.Currently I'm using it for:- Hand pump (storing inside the bag using the top elastic loops- Alien II multitool- Digital tire gauge- Small front-pocket wallet (bill fold and a few credit cards basically)- Keys- iPod- InhalerWith that load it's full and needs to be expanded, but it gets everything out of my pockets without needing to use my larger bag.It seems to be quite high quality. Others have commented on concerns about the clip strength, but I don't think it will be an issue. The clip doesn't need to be flexed much to release and appears sturdy--time will tell."
4,"The atheist probably wouldn't fully appreciate this book. The target audience for this one, like the un-named man that Wormwood has been assigned, is the Christian who needs a booster shot. Lewis, a former atheist himself, speaks through Wormwood of how a Christian, who despite being surrounded by the church, might fall away through simple atrophy. He is biting, sarcastic when he needs to be, and most of all, dead on target."
4,Lewis writes with such incredible insight into the ways satan attacks us. The wisdom in the book is timeless. The language is a bit awkward but that's okay - it just means you need to slow down and read it more carefully. A must read for Christians regardless of your spiritual age. A true literary classic.
4,"A well written book, designed to cover many issues and circumstances in recovery. It has helped me deal with issues and feelings that I may push aside that can cause relapses and stumbles in my day by day journey into renewal.In addition to being highly personal it is also spiritually based, making it a wonderful guide to assist anyone in recovery from other substances (and addictions) beside alcohol and drugs. I think it would be a great tool in recovery/rehab groups too.If you're looking for a COMPLETE interactive guide to recovery that covers everything from emotional, physical, spiritual and personal health and restoration, this is the book for you!DEFINITELY A ""MUST READ!"""
4,A group of us is learning how to play bridge and this is a really vaaluable tool - I would recommend it for anyone learning to play.
4,"this guy is to reggae as Willie Dixon is to blues - snubbed - left out of nearly all compilations - yet anyone I know who has played Best Sellers rates it among the best reggae albumns they have heard - if he has shortcomings they are more than matched in other strengths - this is ""heavy reggae"" - perhaps the best tracks here are Barber Saloon (celebratory carnival mood) and Roots and Culture (eerie but positive)"
4,"Erin Hamiltion (Carol Burnett's daughter, for those not in the know) doesn't so much remake this song as recreate, revitalize, and reenergize it, making it into an instant dancefloor classic. I bought Erin's CD ""One World"" after hearing this song off the ""Trick"" soundtrack, and found that EVERY song packs the same powerful punch as ""Dream Weaver."" You won't be disappointed."
4,"Thanks to Amazon I could buy this for Christmas for my sister-in-law with the non stop sense of humor. This is a hard to find movie, along with the other 2 ""Oh God"" movies starring George Burns. She was pleased and surprised I found all three movies."
4,"Getting to the bed of my Silverado Truck was difficult when hauling my 5th wheel. I had to carry a small stool in order to access the bed. I purchased the Bully AS-550 side steps and the problem was solved. They were a snap to install and they are rock solid when I step on them. When not in use, they rotate to the side out of the way. The step is built out of cast aluminum and the supports are thick welded steel, all giving the step a solid mount. The only negative, and it is slight, is that the step could be a bit wider and they do rattle a little when I hit a bump.Otherwise I give them an A. A definate need on a pickup. Ken"
4,"I was really impressed with my purchase. It arrived in perfect shape,and in a very timely manner.Very good work!"
4,This is a fantastic book. I am a beginner in pen and ink drawing. But the first drawing I created after following her example came out well that I got lot of compliments. She explains all the techniques very well. She has shared years of experience. Thank you!
4,I am not dis -n the song i am just saying that me and my sis think that she sings out of her nose well that is just are opinon even though she has a great voice I still like the # 1 song on her CD well that all we have to go so talk to ya later P.S My friend cass sing real good....From US
4,"......If you dont know,you better ask some body. SPM aka Carlos Coy is given little credit 4 blowing open the doors for latin rappers down south. He should and probably will be ranked with Cypress Hill, Frost, Big Pun, and Fat Joe for their contribution to latin hip hop. But any ways about the album itself I was impressed with his last one ""3rd wish.."", and less than a year later he releases the compilation ""..THE PURITY ALBUM."" This not just a compilation album like Dre's Aftermath album and all the other compilations that make you want your money back he knows how to flow and the beats are slammin, you wont be disappionted. Infact you be anticipating his next one because after all this is almost like a dinner that satisfies but the main course hasnt come yet. But never mind all that this album is a must have."
4,"This is the slowest toaster I've ever owned, but I have to admit - after trying one cheap toaster after another, this is the first one that does exactly what it's supposed to do - toast bread nicely. We had a house fire and mine was destroyed but I am definitely buying the same one again."
4,"I love the way this toaster evenly toasts bread, bagels and english muffins but wish it would raise higher in order to remove the english muffins."
4,"This assortment should be sufficient for most folks around the house. I have purchased these as gifts and they have been well received, especially for sets to be put in lake houses, RV's, and for folks who aren't professional mechanics, but need a tool occasionally. I combined them with some of the drill bit assortment sets Amazon offers, and they make a nice combo. These are not professional grade tools, so don't buy them if you make a living with tools. These are for the homeowner."
4,"Marcio Faraco's impressive vocal performances really distinguish ""Ciranda."" This Brazilian performer's voice is hypnotic and ethereally beautiful. The rhythms of these songs are generally mellow, with touches of playfulness. Although there weren't any songs that particularly stood out from the pack for me, the CD as a whole is definitely worth listening too."
4,"It's 83 A.D. and Pliny the Younger, with his friend Tacitus, is en route to Rome after a tour of duty in Antioch. While stopping over in Smyrna, a gruesome murder occurs, throwing Pliny into the role of a 1st Century Sherlock Holmes. Before we learn who dunnit, Mr. Bell treats us to a romp through the byways and highways of ancient Smyrna while at the same time painlessly illuminating for us the laws and customs of the 1st Century Roman Empire. He does an excellent job of incorporating historical personages into the plot. I especially enjoyed the inclusion of two well-known individuals from the New Testement and their ""peculiar"" beliefs.This is the first of a series featuring the detective exploits of Pliny the Younger. The second, The Blood of Caesar, is equally good and I look forward to more such adventures."
4,"I bought this for my son.....He is healthy and strong, and it gives him quite a work out. I enjoy watching it and maraveling....but much to advanced for me."
4,"I've had this dvd for a few years. When I am in good shape I can do the whole thing. When I'm out of shape I can only do half. It is long and strenuous, but a calm practice, with a great teacher.Rodney has great control, and that is inspiring."
4,"I did this for the first time--got through it all, felt fabulous, and only fell down once (half moon pose)! Excellent, indeed, for those of us more advanced. I am blown away that Rodney crafts a workout that is rigorous, yet the entire time I am mentally and spiritually relaxed and happy within. Bravo!Regarding other reviews about lack of core work: try Sadie Nardini's Core Strength Vinyasa Yoga...that is my other favorite. Sadie weaves specific abdominal work into the Vinyasa flow (ex: rather than going from down dog w/leg extended straight into Salutations, she'll have you bring the leg forward to half plank at the chest, extend back again (twice), then go into the Salutation. Ab work is woven throughout. I feel Sadie's practice may be more tailored to women's bodies specifically, but I respect and appreciate this workout from Rodney, and will enjoy doing it regularly also.Thank you, Rodney!"
4,"I am a beginner/intermediate in yoga. This is a great full-body workout with several repeating sequences that are not too hard to follow for anyone who knows most basic poses but challenging enough for someone more advanced. Great pace, not too fast or slow, every position change is verbally queued. If you only get one yoga video this is a very good one."
4,I got this for a project my son is doing on WW 2 Raf. the Battle of Brittain. It is so well detailed and beautiful. He is 13 and wants to continue learning about WW 2 and USA. Thank you for effusing his enthusiasm.
4,"A child's story, as in the harry Potter series where the heroes are very young. The witch craft is better explained if far fetched but I just suspend the irregularities and enjoy the story and the very adult themes. I have not finished the last book, The Amber Spyglass so I don't know who is going to get theirs in the end. Catholic church does take a drubbing but the very young heros and heroines are so unworldly that the author can sort of get away with it. I like the books,they are an easy read and not likely will be on the children's shelf in religious homes if the parents read it."
4,"Ok,so these books do have dark parts.But that's life,take the good with the bad.During the first few pages of The Golden Compass,I was hooked.I love the plot and how Lyra had a tough life.She stumbles upon a door to a different world and gets taken on an adventure she'll never forget.The Golden Compass has to do with an artifact with special powers.In the Subtle Knife,Lyra meets Will,who finds a knife that can open up doors to the other worlds.The Amber Spyglass is when Will and Lyra go on a trip,I won't say where.I love all three!"
4,"As a teenager I enjoyed reading the 'Lord of the Rings', 'Narnia' and a few years later, well outside my childhood years, I did derive significant pleasure from the Harry Potter series. As an adult though, these novels register as good works of fantasy well worth their entertainment value but it stops there. (Although I still envy the young mind that opens the Lord of the Rings for the first time). Philip Pullman's trilogy 'His Dark Materials' plays in a different league altogether. A child will enjoy it for the adventure and breathtaking storytelling. An adult will find the retelling of the ""Felix Culpa"", with a twist, very titillating and the penmanship mesmerizing. This work truly ranks with the likes of Selma Lagerlof's (1909 Nobel literature Prize winner) 'Gosta Berling Saga'. A true Masterpiece for all ages. Already showered with numerous awards, the best indicator of the excellence of this work is in the passionate debate it generates."
4,"Ever since I first read Northern Lights (UK name for the Golden Compass) over two years ago, I've been competely obsessed with this series. I just couldn't stop reading it from when Lyra and Pan crept into the retiring room right until Lyra and Will made a pact to come to the bench on Midsummer's Eve. This book is perfect for people ages 10 and up who like a little bit of Fantasy, Sci Fi, and Reality. Philip Pullman, you are without a doubt the best author that ever walked this, and other, worlds!"
4,An exciting tale with great imagination and characters. NOT for younger children because of violence and religious topics.
4,"Good quality, and great books to have it at home, and after you done with it will looks great in your bookshelf, until your next generation would be able to enjoy it too."
4,"This book incorporated three stories - The Golden Compass, The Subtle Knife, and The Amber Spyglass. I brought the books with me on vacation, on the recommendation of a friend who reads a lot of (and teaches) adolescent literature, a genre I haven't touched in 20 years. I was really impressed with the stories - the themes of freedom, adventure, innocence/experience, stewardship, friendship - it was an amazing trilogy. I recommend it."
4,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I am not huge into fantasy so it took me a while to get into them. Once that happened, I had all three read in a week. Unfortunately I was a little bummed out by the ending, but getting there was worth the mild let down."
4,"Brent Henderson's Review For The Golden CompassIt was a great book because it was very adventurous and it made sense, although the ending was kind of sad. It was long, but not too long. I read the whole ""His Dark Materials"" series, but this is my favorite. I couldn't put it down!"
4,Other reviewers have written detailed reviews of this wonderful novel but I wanted to add my praise. I fell in along side these characters and shared their joys and pains. Justin Cronin is a great writer and this is a great work. I'm glad I found this gem!
4,"Just finished reading Mary and O'Neil, and I know that it will stay with me for a long time. I laughed and cried, sighed and nodded my head as I read. This a very well crafted novel comprised of short stories, reminding me of the chapters of our lives. The relationships between parents and children, siblings, spouses and friends are realistically portrayed. Thanks to the author for a special experience. I look forward to reading his novel, The Summer Guest soon."
4,I received exactly what I order promptly and in great condition. This is the first frame drum I've owned. I can only compare it to others I've used and it is above average to me and a good value. I like that it comes with a beater included. I already have dreams of a larger tuneable drum in the future :)
4,"Received the album today, put it in my CD-player and found that the album was more spacey then what I heard of Sasha before, including Norther Exposure. But then halfway of either disc, the trance kicked in, the bass got pumping and gradually I went from floating on a cloud into rafting on a wild river, seamlessly. Sasha had done it again. So now I think I'll call in sick tomorrow and listen to these tracks all day."
4,"I've heard and played a lot of trance in my time, and Sasha's CD stands out as iterally the greatest CD I have ever owned, and the greatest mix I have ever heard.I prefer the first CD over the second one, as it is easier to move to, but both are supreme in both their composition and execution. Breathtaking to hear, unbelievable to dance to, essential to own."
4,"The Global Underground series started back in `97 I think and it played a very important role in elevating the quality of trance music. Before that, we were seeing some cheesy trance being mixed into CD`s and sold and on the other hand, some big tracks being the only forte of some CD`s. But GU, hiring the best DJ`s in the world, changed that trend somewhat. All the GU CD`s have been exceptional, with my personal favourite having been NY ... till now. GU 013 surpasses the already high quality standards of any GU cd upto date and sets a new high, and with it Sasha (always the best) comepels the others to raise their standards to his. If ever there was a CD from Global Underground that you had to buy ... it is this. I should know .. I have all of them."
4,"Freefall is my second book by this author,and after reading her Edge Of Recall and now this,I have to say how very impressed I am with her writing skills and originality.She takes me places that I have never been before and the historical lessons she gives are at the very least,very interesting,and at times fascinating.Her writing skills make me feel that I am there and experiencing the story myself.Having this story set in Kuai,Hawaii,I found especially pleasing,since I've always enjoyed an armchair love affair with Hawaii,but have never been there. Her descriptions really put me there.She also does an excellent job developing her characters.This is a wonderful,exciting mystery without the gore of so many mysteries,which causes me to avoid most in the 'mystery' genre.I have become an ardent fan of this author."
4,"I can't say I loved this book. It was well-written (what else would you expect from Heitzmann?) and the characters were fully developed and believable. The story itself was intriguing and fresh. What caught me by surprise was that the story started out as a thriller, then with about 150 pages to go slipped into a romance, then morphed into a thriller again at the climax. I must say this, though, kudos to Heitzmann and Bethany House for pushing the envelope with the romantic elements as far as CBA fiction goes (it got quite racey at times). Overall, Freefall was a solid book, a little long (over 460 pages), but written well enough to sustain the story."
4,"I bought this cd originally for one song,""End of the Beginning"". I thought it was worth the purchase,and it was. However, now that I have listened to the whole album, I enjoy every song. This cd is wonderful!!"
4,"After some effort, I was able to install Mandrake 8.2. Once it is upand running it is really slick. A few things did not work, like Xsanefor my epson 1240U scanner. Other than that it was capatible with everythingelse that I had hooked to my computer. It even had a slick j-pilotapplication for syncing my palm pilot."
4,"I've been using MDK 8.2 for a few weeks now and its performance is really good. It requires a good quantity of RAM (128 are okay, but double that and it flies). I run it on a 400 mhz PII with an 8 mb Trident card and it works really well. Its ""wizards"" are very useful for the new user: they make tweaking your machine a very simple process."
4,"I like this book a lot because it gives me an introduction to Rat hunting and made me familiar with the subject. As it is written by a man with vast experience in this field, it is very accurate and useful."
4,This router met every one of my specs. If you read the manual it says to use this code 09 f9 11 02 9d 74 e3 5b d8 41 56 c5 63 56 88 c0.
4,This integrated seamlessly into my old linksys router. Easy set up and good online documentation. It does not have as great a range as I expected. I am in an old 3 story house (plaster walls). It did not reach from the third floor to the first floor (as I hoped it would). Hard wired to the 2nd floor it has good range througout the house and through brick walls into the back yard. Zero disconnect issues after 2 months of use. (Old linksys with antenna booster sucked).
4,"Rebeccasreads recommends THE SEVEN SYMPHONIES as a masterful immersion into murder, music & morality.Rather heavy on the language, yet overall when you've finished THE SEVEN SYMPHONIES you'll know a lot about Sibelious & Finland, as well as what makes a killer tick, if not what makes the heart love."
4,"Although I found DD to be repetitive because of the way the material was presented, I did learn alot of MM's personal life's history, and that she was probably overwhelmed by her personal problems and overdosed on her medications."
4,THE MOTOROLA MD761 ANSWERING MACHINE IS A QIUCK AN EASY initial setup with custom settings such as ringertype and caller id. I was told that the system eats through batteries on the handset but i haven't owned it long enough to review this critique for my own. i like the system so far and reccomend both by seller and her product that she sold!
4,I have been a fan of Left Behind since 2000 and I was so ecstatic when LB1 came out but I viewed it and I was slightly disappointed. But when I heard that LB2 was coming out in October 02 I WAS SO HAPPY! I rented the movie and I loved it. All 95 minutes of it! no complaints. Watch this movie only if you have seen the first!
4,Milton is the only air pressure gauge I trust for high pressure applications. My motorhome steer tires require 120psi and every inexpensive gauge has failed to properly inflate the tire. The Milton has been crossed checked by several commercial sources and always comes in +/- 1 pound. My last Milton lasted 16 years so the cost spread over the life makes it a good investment. The larger size also makes it a lot easier to use and a lot harder to loose!
4,The book arrived on time with no tears and in good shape. I have no complaints about this particular product.
4,"YOU CAN GET ALL THESE GREAT TRACKS ON THE JSP BOX SET ENTITLED ROCKIN THIS HOUSE FOR ALOT LESS ,ITS AROUND $22.00 ITS LISTED UNDER MEMPHIS SLIM.

GREAT STUFF FROM 1946-1953.SO SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY THE JSP BOX SET AND ENJOY ALL THE EXTRA CUTS AND ARTISTS."
4,"This cd is a very cool remix album of the original (Dex, Effects, and 909s). Very minimal and very groovy. After hearing numerous other albums and bootlegs this cd is a collectors Item. Cant wait to hear more from the plastik man himself."
4,"I truly believe that every person can learn a great deal about themselves by reading and implementing the recommendations in this book. I would reiterate what many of the other reviewers mentioned here. Take more control of your life and put it on a better track to not only achieve your goals but interact with the world.That said I would like to say to the author that this is absolutely the worst edited book I have ever read. There are so many examples of a ""the"" that should be ""he"" or and ""of"" that is in a sentence that shouldn't be there, or similar grammatical mistakes. Interestingly these are not errors that would be picked up by a spell checker in a word processor.Despite that, the book can truly change our life. It is all up to you."
4,"This film, from Richard (A Hard Day's Night) Lester, is a black and white, darkly hilarious comedy about sexuality and relationships in 1960s England. The filmmaking is anarchic and brilliantly edited; it looks modern compared to films of today, even thought its influence is not widely known. Lester is working at the height of his ability here, and ""The Knack...and how to get it"" stands as his greastest achievement in a long and varied career. It's fun and the performances, though all comically exaggerated, are top-notch.I bought the video on a whim, and I consider it a great investment in any video collection of experimental, obscure films.Grade: A"
4,"I like E.M. Forster's book, I love the opulent Puccini-filled Merchant Ivory version of the book, and I also loved this PBS version. The acting was excellent and its overall tone and the characterizations feel closer to Forster's novel. Yes, liberties were taken with the plot and the ending, but that didn't bother me at all, just made me want to view the movie a second time."
4,"Some-where between star wars and star trek, there lies a distant galaxy where great films reside. Films such as Galaxy Quest, The Last Star Fighter and Ice Pirates. This is a film not to be missed as sci fi comedy is all to hard find. This is a very serious comedy with serious aliens and some very serious battles,that will make you laugh. I have been looking for it on DVD,not vhs."
4,"An unparalleled book on Western Martial Arts. After reading this book and applying the techniques and principles therein, my ability with the sword increased radically. Mr. Clemonts Practices what he preaches: I have seen him in action. There's a lot of people talking, but not many delivering. John Clemonts delivers."
4,"I'm Italian and love to cook -- these canisters fit my kitchen perfectly. The exterior is gorgeous, and the interior has a clean satin finish that's perfect for storing dry goods like nuts and grains. This larger canister easily holds 1 lb of rice, nuts and bread crumbs.The lids are a finely-textured and understated black plastic, with a very smooth-functioning metal clasp. They come in two different designs and two different sizes; I have both and highly recommend them."
4,"This foreign film was heartbreaking and heartwarming. It was very interesting to see how the characters develop throughtout the film, there is a short part where the audience is left wondering who is who in the story but then it is all quickly revealed. Very well written film. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
4,"Great story. I watch it over and over to practice my Portuguese but it's such a good story, it's a joy every time."
4,"Wow, this mix is GREAT!!...I mean once I heard it, I was like wow, nice intro and nice selection of songs...I highly recommend this CD to anyone that likes hard/progressive/trance/club music... If you are one of those people that do, get this CD...you won't regret it...By the way be sure to check out djslurp dot com for the VERY BEST of *Progressive*Trance*Club Music! Be sure to preview his new mix on his site ...once again its djslurp dot com ... You won't be disappointed! :)"
4,"Sailing to Utopia is definately one of Moorcock's best works. It's sparse language and epic plot lines will leave you terrified, yet at the same time you are completely fulfilled. Each story in the novel is fabulous, even though they don't tie in to each other. Moorcock has written concurrent stories with other Eternal Champion novels (Hawkmoon, Corum: the Coming of Chaos), you can't let this influence you in any way of how intense this book is. Instead of having a concurrent plot line throughout, Moorcock's places themes behind his stories that tie them together as one. However, each story is so enriched with life that each one can definately stand alone as an extraordinary piece of writing."
4,"I received this book as a Secret Santa gift, and although I'm slightly out of its targeted age range, I still adore it. The artwork has thick lines so one can color well, and the many pages of pictures insure most characters are depicted. I recommend this book not only to those purchasing a gift for a small child but for any Harry Potter-lover."
4,"This is another outstanding achievement for BoC. My only qualm is that some of the most interesting songs are so short.In terms of sound, in is a natural progression from ""in a beautiful place in the country"". They still use vintage samples from old documentaries.All in all, I enjoy this one more than ""Music has the Right to Children"". It has more of that atmospherical quality to the music that just makes you feel nostalgic for times you've never even experienced."
4,"they do great things with synths and samples. much more complex than most folks out there, but they did that last time 'round. little risk and lite growth, especially in the beats."
4,"The sneakers were very comfortable as soon as I put them on. I immediately went for a walk and they felt great. The velcro straps probably could be an eighth of an inch longer to allow for extra tightening, but the shoes looked smart and I received compliments. They seem to be well made and I would buy Propet sneakers again."
4,"I've got these shoes in 10EEEE size for Grandma. Her feet and ankles swell with water. She has trouble finding socks that will fit, forget the shoes! But these ones were different. She easily put her foot in, velcro opened all way up, and first thing she said: - feels comfortable."
4,THIS WAS PURCHASED AS A GIFT FOR A FRIEND WHO IS A ROY ROGERS FAN. SHE JUST RAVED ABOUT THE MOVIE AND HOW MUCH IT BROUGHT HER BACK TO HER CHILDHOOD.
4,While not the world's greatest singer Shelley Fabares compensates for this with Charm Plus. I think that she is Shelley Fabulous.
4,"This is another masterful biography by Troyat. In this case it is of the Russian poet who more than any other is revered and loved as the supreme creator in the Russian language. His story is a tragic one, of violent love and early death. His story is also the story of one who in every genre he tried became the archetypal master. And of the one who to this day is loved by the Russians most."
4,I first read this book when I was 10 nearly 25 years ago and I liked the book. It was a good book and I was surprised to read the reviews about the book ruining their child's Christmas. I knew by 10 years old that there was really no Santa. That did not ruin the book for me at all.
4,sense and sensebility;I did not expect to like this series.Because I am hooked onEmma Thompsons movie.But it took me with suprise.I actually enjoyed it.I have watched it twice already and will watch it again many times.this series is more detailed which is good.Persuasion;I was suprised how much I liked it especially Anne.she is great and her lover is very handsome indeed!They look at each other so lovingly.very much romantic.Dont like the kissing at the end though.They didnt have open lip kissing then I dont think/.it takes away the romantism.anyway.lovely movie.I will watch it again for sure.
4,"the quality on these dvd's were/are just as I had hoped, great. I have been watching them over and over. Thanks!!!!"
4,"I really liked the 1995 Sense & Sensibility movie, and pretty much shunned other versions until I came cross this one. Now it's my favorite of the two, mostly because of the expanded version, wonderful acting, terrific casting, and drop-dead gorgeous scenery. It's well worth the watch, and I probably will watch it many times over. Casting was right on, especially for Edward Ferris and Colonel Brandon, as well as the two Dashwood sisters. Everything about the production was very touching. Worth the purchase to add to your library of Austen works."
4,"A must read for all serious Robotech fans. It ties all plot threads together and also includes a flashback to an awesome Zentraedi-Invid battle. Want to know what happened to the Robotech Elders, the Regis and the SDF-1 fold drives? Want to know where the Flower of Life originates from? Then read this book!"
4,"I have followed Safire since she emerged onto the music scene with her huge dance hit ""don't break my heart"" back in 86. I have seen her perform, and loved all her music videos. This is one true talent. She was by far one of the most popular entertainers in the latin dance/pop movement of the late 80's & early 90's & continues to be very popular. this cd is awesome, all of her dance/radio hits reworked & updated. All vocals are brand new. I understand she will ""retired"" from the freestyle genre to pursue another form of music. I look forward to her next project. safire is a true talent and deserves the attention she once garnered. i love you girl!"
4,"I should have looked at the description more closely. This has very little storage space. Even the top is less than an 1/2 inch deep, if that. But so far, everything else about it is great. It IS made with paper, so don't let it get wet."
4,"I bought this jewelry box for my 5 year old's birthday. It is very well made and will last many years. As with anything, I made sure she understands how to wind the box, to not overwind or touch the horse too roughly. We both love the design and it is something she will grow with until she gets into her teens at least. Very happy with this purchase."
4,"FAMILY MEMBER'S AND FRIENDS LOOK FOWARD TO GETTING TOGEATHER TO FELLOWSHIP AND JUST HAVE FUN, AND THIS GAME CALLED SEQUENCE IS THE TALK OF THE PARTY."
4,"Very nice replacements for the originals. These have a large capacity, have metal sleeves and have Cross imprinted. Works great, good price and I expect many hours of use by looking at the ink reservoir."
4,"The standard US version of this release is mysteriously OUT OF PRINT for some reason! However, this is an import version titled ""World mix"" with different cover artwork and bonus mixes and therefore is an essential item for those who cannot get a hold of a copy of the original Deep Forest albumDeep Forest came around shortly after the huge success of Enigma who combined Gregorian chants to ambient dance rhythms. Deep Forest came up with a similar concept except it was to mix Pygmy/African vocal samples with dance rhythms creating a sound all it's own. While the following Deep Forest cds have been great as well, none of them have matched the qualities and beauty found on this release and therefore it is among one of most essentials albums of the progressive world music genres of all time."
4,"I saw the leper of Saint Giles one day in a book store and thought it sounded good, It is the 5th book in the series,I liked it so much I decided to read the series in order. I thought this book Was really good also. Brother Cadfael is a very enjoyable character and, I'm getting a great mystery and learning something about 12th century England at the same time."
4,"This book starts off slowly, but fans of Hercule Poirot should really like it. Brother Cadfael is an unusual detective, and this story is a real change from modern detective stories that are full of foul language and crudity."
4,"I have another version of this cookbook that my mom looked through on her last visit. She commented that she'd really like one of these. Since we both agreed that the crockpot is the working woman's best friend, I ordered it and sent it to her for mother's day. She was very excited. The recipes are easy and although somewhat bland in several instances, they are great bases for using your own spices and ideas to spruce them up. It certainly helps with having dinner on the table by 6pm!"
4,"I enjoyed reading this - I loved the examples it gave, and it's easy-to-read format."
4,The condition of the book was like new. I wanted toread this since in the 1960. Thanks for the book.
4,"I was a lifetime Mormon till I went through a divorce and decided to take a critical look at my own beliefs. Having been born in the Church, serving a full time Mission and marrying in the temple I thought I knew all about Joseph Smith and the history of Mormonism. This book changed my life more than the Book of Mormon ever could have. For the first time many missing parts of the Mormon puzzle began to fit together and my life, as I understood it came crashing down. I literally threw up as I discovered what a bastard Joseph Smith was. No, this book isn't perfect, but having been written in 1945, it has proven itself to be the definitive expose of Mormonism's founder. I bear witness it has more truth in it than you will find inside the whitewashed history of the Mormon Church. I found myself unable to return my copy to the library and chose to pay the replacement cost. It is one of my most cherished possessions."
4,"I purchased this set for my granddaughter who is getting ready to go off to college. She hasn't used it because she doesn't leave for two months. However, we are very pleased with how it looks now. It's an attractive set and the quality is good."
4,Fantastic product. It makes a great night light to see the dash and console trays containing items. I wish I had found this item years ago.
4,"No matter what diet you do you will not be successful without being honest. If you use this book and accurately record what you eat, your activities and your fluid intake this will be the best guide to what works for you and your body. You have to 'bite it - write it' means if you eat it you write it down. This personal history with the record of your weight loss will show you what works for you and more importantly what doesn't. Work? Yes but you are working for yourself and as the days past you can look back and use that information to make better choices. When taken to your doctor or a nutritionist the advice they given will be more personalized."
4,"THE TALL GUY has been a favorite of mine for years. I take great pride in being a fan of this ""guilty pleasure"" film! I try to turn people onto it as often as possible.THE TALL GUY, first and foremost, is very British in its humor, which means there is irony, surrealism, and jokes that don't depend on insults (Americans *love* the insult-joke).THE TALL GUY has the funniest sex scene (Goldblum and Thompson) that I've ever seen. And as others have mentioned, the ELEPHANT! musical is hysterical. I cried the first time I saw the musical numbers ... it's that hilarious.At heart, THE TALL GUY is a sweet romance. But its British sensibilities and backstage humor (Goldblum's character is an underdog actor) lifts it above an average screwball comedy. And Emma Thompson is very charming as Nurse Kate! One forgets after all of her serious Shakespeare and Jane Austin roles that she is quite a comedienne.So enjoy THE TALL GUY! And remember: ""Somewhere up in heaven there's an angel with big ears."""
4,"This is a very funny, well-acted piece, for anyone who loves real, true comedy. It is a very perceptive commentary on the world of theatre, and the very idea of a musical comedy version of the tragic Elephant Man just makes me laugh again and again. Jeff Goldblum and Emma Thompson are really great!"
4,This refill was what I expected and I am enjoying using my Cross pen again.
4,"I had a Webster's 10th some years ago on CD (Zane) which had a great interface and additional features this does not have. To me this edition is burdensome even though all of the words have complete entries. The addition of the unabridged version is very helpful and tilts it into being more useful. Speaking for myself, I really don't want to use a book type dictionary and this software mimics that process which makes it less intuitive and not integrated at all. I never open it feeling it going to make my task easier, although it does; it simply makes it more complicated than it needs to be."
4,The book is a good introduction for the people who want to learn the Greek language beyond the greek basics. It offers a comprehensive approach in teaching and it has been updated to cover the modern Greek language. It is also a good book to have because it extends beyond the limitations of other Greek-language books which are focused for travelers only. I would recommend it.
4,We're addicted. A friend recommended it - I bought it a year later and we play it every night. We play with our neighbors and also our six year old. Our six year old is able to get the strategy and wins sometimes. A great game for two people or six people.
4,Great game really had not had time to play it much but glad to know it is in our home when ever we get the chance to play.
4,"We have this game and played with my twin sister and her family, our daughter and her family and our son and his family. They loved it so much that I purchased 3 games, one for each of them for Christmas as a family gift. The thing that we love about this game is it is for any age."
4,"not only have we enjoyed the game, all we have played it with did also.Some have purchased it, and this is our 3rd order."
4,"Love this game. Played it first at a family reunion, and had to buy it for our family. Challenging and fun."
4,Deluxe SequenceWe found this game and have enjoyed playing it. It combines the luck of the draw and a lot of strategy.
4,We have large family gatherings and this game is fun to play with entire family or with just two players. Ours is out on the game table right now!
4,I played an older version of the game at a neighbour's and immediately ordered it from Amazon.It is simple enough that kids of any age can play - yet contains enough strategy that it will keep older players coming back.A great game period.
4,"This is a great video, my grandchildren really like it. It came in time for Christmas, so the service was great."
4,"Yes, this is the North American Format--works just fine on my cheap Japanese DVD player. The DVD is high quality considering NMA is a band of limited means. It boasts 8 different quality camera angles and the sound quality is great. This was shot a month or so after the 2003 Justin/Dean tour, and has a song from ""Navigating by the Stars"" on it. This is a must for any NMA fan!Keep the faith."
4,I grew up watching Johnny Carson and always thought he did and awesome job interviewing his guests.This DVD is the best of the best so go ahead and buy it!
4,"The news of Johnny's death really saddened me, as I always thought we'd hear one more xmas special or something out of him. Unfortunately, it seems, the networks rubbed him the wrong way, too bad for us. Otoh, I'm glad Johnny stayed Johnny till the end. I feel priviledged to have grown up watching Carson on late nights, he had a great personality and was great with people, and a great American, imho.Most of the footage I've seen in the various 'tributes' after his death is in this set, which kind of spoiled it, but still nice to see again. I never thought much of the last couple shows, the Bette Midler singing has got way way too much airtime. I wish I had a few taped episodes from the 70-80's. Here's hoping that we see some in the future, sure there'd be some money in that, lol. Hey Ed, you're great too. I'll have to look for some old starsearch episodes now."
4,"With taking Geometry this year, I got stuck with a not so great teacher, and decided I needed extra help. We saw this product, and decided to purchase it. So far, it has great animated examples, quizzes, and tests. It also includes a ""game"" for when you pass a test with a good grade. This program contains eight discs starting at pre-algebra going up to calculus and also statistics, and ""real life math."" A great deal for brushing up or using for high school, like I am!"
4,"we love the old shows we recently have beed watching (METV, AntennaTV) all of them are on there so now we have our own to go camping with. We watched McHale for breakfast last Sat & Sunday what a way to start your day!"
4,"Yeah it's that good... I was amazed at how easy it stripped the wire, despite the simple design. I'm surprised that they were even able to apply for a patent for such a simple mechanism. It even strips Teflon 20AWG wire, (24AWG doesn't work though) Of course, it also didn't cost $140."
4,"The shirt is great. I feel like it ran a little on the small side, but if you are looking for a fitted style shirt it should be fine. It has held up very well and looks great with khakis. Go Vols!!! :)"
4,"Lovesey's latest Peter Diamond mystery is, not surprisingly, good. Diamond, still recovering from his wife's death is brought in to investigate the murder of a Bath woman. As the woman was involved in the investigation of a serial killing, Diamond is gradually roped into that as well, bringing both cases to conclusion.What I liked a lot about the novel and the series is the ongoing character development we see from book to book. Ingeborg, the journalist turned policewoman we met in a previous novel is a fresh new addition, together with Hen--Diamon's counterpart from the beach town where one of the murders occured. I will strongly recommend this book to fans of police procedural series."
4,"At the March 2008 meeting of the NYC LGBT Center Book Discussion group, we discussed ""Nightwood"" by Djuna Barnes.We had a very small group that was surprised at the difficultly and rewards and incomprehensibility and pleasure of the novel. One reader brought his notes about Barnes' biography, which were very helpful. By discussing several aspects of the novel, we learned more about what was going on and made sense of much of it, including the ""what just happened?!"" ending.We all agreed that it is much more understandable on its second reading. This may be a great novel (#11 on The Publishing Triangle's list of 100 Best Lesbian and Gay Novels), but it seems very odd and difficult to approach without knowing Barnes' life and having some additional tools to handle the text.Why did I give this four stars? This is a three-star review for the book itself and a FIVE-STAR REVIEW for book groups considering reading it."
4,"I am new at doll customizing and Sabrina's book is a KEEPER!!! Step by step instructions WITH PICTURES for choosing a doll, face painting, styling hair, designing a costume, beading techniques, accessories and boxing your doll. Lots of added helpful hints that are easy to follow. Its the next best thing to having Sabrina right here showing me what to do. Its a must have book!"
4,"If you're like me and wish Slowdive/Mojave 3's former frontman Neil Halsted would stop trying to be Nick Drake and go back to composing the beautifully crafted pop we came to enjoy back in the early 90s, Monster Movie is for you. Monster Movie includes Slowdive's Christian Savill and pretty much continues where the legendary British band left off. This is truly dreampop and shoegaze at its absolute finest. Last Night Something Happened was my favorite album of 2002 and still one of my all-time favorites.HIGHLY recommended for fans of Slowdive, Mahogany, Ride and Chapterhouse!"
4,"A nose trimmer is not a complicated piece of machinery, but is a necessary one. Using clippers or scissors just doesn't make it and you risk infection. This device has tiny surgical stainless-steel blades and runs fast and smooth. No pinching and no discomfort. It is a bit touchy to clean as the central shaft and blades once out rather easily for cleaning under tap water. I could easily see losing a piece down the drain. But for a small, lightweight and packable `nose and ear' trimmer, it does the job and it's not that expensive. I'll be the first to admit that nose trimmers are not sexy, but neither are nose hairs!Battery not included. Also, when I first got my trimmer, the ON/OFF button wouldn't turn off. I returned it and was given a new one within a week."
4,Works better than at least 3 types I've bought since I last had this type. Can't find this in any BAM in this part of the country. Happy to find it on line.
4,"So far this Braun Multiquick does the job. But it is not as well made as my original that was 12-14 years old. The steel blade and other parts do not fit as securely on the base as the older machine. They wobble on the stem when inserted. I guess that just the way things are made today...not as precisely as in the past. But it does seem to work. I haven't tried the many attachments and am looking forward to doing so.Delivery was prompt, etc., so no complaint there."
4,"This is our first food processor, and we've been using it for about 9 months now. So far, it is working great. We use it to grate and shred cheese with no problems. It chops vegetables well. We have used the dough hook for creating pastry doughs. We have not used the whip or the juicer yet. I do wish that it came with two different size slicers (thin and thick), but I've managed on just the one. Our food processor gets used at least once a week, if not more. Love it.I hesitate to offer any criticisms, since I haven't used another food processor for comparison purposes and I'm still learning how to use the processor effectively. That being said, I have noticed that it is easy to overfill, and that sometimes the food gets stuck under the blade. However, I still gave this product 5 stars because I feel that these two ""complaints"" are probably more in the line of user errors."
4,"Feel this machine does a great job overall, but must confess that I just use one of the attachements, the chopping blade. I did try a few of the other attachments when I first got it, but wasn't thrilled with the performance of the other attachments, such as the one that slices thin slices. I also tried the juicing attachment when I first got it, but decided that it was more trouble than it was worth to use it. It has been a long time since I tried any of the other attachments, but if you just mainly want a blade for chopping up stuff, it works great. Very powerful and does a quick job of chopping up everything that I put in there. I have used it for cabbage, carrots, garlic, onions, nuts (made nut butters with it using raw nuts), sweet potatoes, frozen broccoli, and other fruits and veggies. No complaints, would buy it again."
4,"No, Marilyn can NOT act, in this film or any other. Yes, she is a great screen presence, worth watching just to watch. Sad, because this could have been a very good film (NOT great, just very good). She has all the wonderful lines in the movie, but with no sense of timing or inflection or delivery. Olivier is merely wooden. The dowager is admirably restrained in a role that could have gone over the top in cutesyness. The young king/prince Nicholas, played by Jeremy Spenser, is charming and gorgeous (It's totally illogical that Marilyn doesn't fall for HIM!--and by the way, whatever happened to Jeremy Spenser?) Still, overall I give it 4 stars because it is quite watchable. And I'll watch it again (if for no other reason than to try to understand the strange ending)."
4,"Ever since i was in 7th grade i have been doing musicals, my grand total of shows is about 20 (i'm only in 11th grade). And HONK! is the current one, and it is more fun than anything other show i have done! I'm not a lead, but suporting, and it is worth it to just be in the show! The musical is beautyful and witty, it will have your audience in fits of laughter!"
4,"I have been using older model, basically the same as the one I ordered for the last 5 years. Wouldn't have had to buy this one if my wife hadn't dropped the old one."
4,"My last nose hair trimmer was my Daddy's. It was big and had handgrips for each hand, an old plug- in- the- wall type. It was best if you had someone help holding it cuz it was heavy. You had to keep the blades sharp, or it'll rip the hairs out of your nose. Most of the time it left you bloody.I like this one better cuz all you got to do is put a battery in and turn it on. This thing cuts all types of hair. I bet this thing would cut a male gorilla's nose hair pretty good if you could teach a gorilla how to turn it on. It's real easy; you just push that switch on the side. Big thick black hairs too. It isn't like those cheap trimmers that were made in Japan. This one was made in China. I bet I could teach a Gorilla how to use this trimmer. It works on batteries. It works good."
4,"I ordered this product based on the testimonials of the other reviewers for this product. I have not been disappointed and feel that these reviews indicating an excellent product are right on the money! This trimmer is easy to use, discreet, and fast. Great product."
4,"This truly is the MACH 3 of nose trimmers, worked great for those hard to reach hairs, worth every penny!!"
4,I have owned mine for about a year. Still works great. I just bought one for my Dad (on my Mom's request...)Does the job simply and easily. The single battery lasts quite a while.
4,Works perfectly for my Apple TV to Apple Stereo connection. All Digital now and crystal clear! I thought the product quality was excellent with very good fit and finish.
4,"I use this to port digital audio from my Airport Express to my receiver. Works great, and you can't beat the low price."
4,This was the first themal pot coffee maker I bought and it is still going strong four or five years later. In the meantime (in different houses) I have had a Cuisinart version and a Rowenta version and neither is as good or as easy to use as this one. The Capresso even manages to have an interior that doesn't stain. Good job!
4,"I was happy to find a 3-6-9 Omega that I could take. I have had no issues. I take this with Folic Acid and B-12 every morning and have no issues other than needing to eat something or drink coffee after taking it. If I don't, it will make my stomach hurt or make me nauseous. Other than that, no issues."
4,"MR. JONES IS A POET. HE TAKES HIS LYRICAL STYLE AND TRANSMUTES IT LIKE NO OTHER. I APPLAUD HIM BY TRYING TO SEND OUT POSITIVE MESSAGES TO OUR YOUNGER RAP LISTENERS. HE'S ALSO GOING TO HAVE THE RAP INDUSTRIE ON LOCK. BLOW UP BABY. STAY POSITIVE,AND FOCUSED. ONE LOVE..."
4,"Alright, as we all know, Illmatic was a straight up hip-hop classic. You couldn't get any tighter than that, but I think that with I Am, Nas is pretty damn close. I was kind of impressed at how he balanced his two personalities--Nasty Nas and Nas Esco. When I heard that both his ""personas"" were on the CD, I was hoping for a face-off of both (think something like DMX's Stop Being Greedy and you'll catch my drift ;o} ) My favorite joints on the CD were ""Pray,"" ""Big Things,"" ""Undying Love""(c'mon, u had to love that surprise ending), ""I Wanna Talk To You"", ""You Won't See Me Tonight"", etc., I don't know about the rest of you but I was really feeling Nature's Shine, too... K, that's my two cents."
4,"WHAT CAN I SAY? I REALLY ENJOY THIS CD. MY PERSONAL FAVORITES ARE YOU WON'T SEE ME TONIGHT, I WANNA TALK ,GETTO PRISONERS AND HATE ME NOW AND NAS IS LIKE ."
4,"Nas has done it again. This cd is all that. It starts off with classic lines and clips from his past songs, which reminds you of the skills that this kid has. I have to say that i think every track on this cd was really good. He goes from mainstream hip hop like ""hate me now"" with puff daddy to hardcore stuff like ""life is what you make it"" featuring DMX. There is even a track where he raps over an R. Kelly song. Nas has put out probably the best album since Biggie Smalls's ""Life after Death"".Best songs- Life is what you make it, Nas is like, Hate me now, Undying love, small world, and Big things"
4,"The Monster in the Closet is a wonderful send up of classic man-in-a-rubber-suit b-movies of the 50's. In this one, a mysterious monster suddenly appears in a closet in a small town North of San Francisco and proceeds to start killing people. It is able to move from closet to closet unseen.Richard Clark is a hopeless reporter who is sent out to cover the nutty story. What he finds is a true story of horror and terror that can shock the world. He is suddenly in the middle of the biggest story ever.A wonderful cast helps keep the movie right on track. Claude Akins is the tobacco-spitting Sherif and Henry Gibson is an Einstein-like scientist plus many others.The movie is rated PG although Stella Stevens has a nude scene and many of the disks extras (there are dozens) are obviously R rated. But if you have ever loved those campy B flicks, you will really want to see this one."
4,This is one of my favorite movies. I watched this with my 10 year old granddaughter because I thought it exemplified the Good Samaritan of which Jesus taught. Also I don't think strong language defines a person's heart or intentions.Mississippi John Hurt's 'Farther Along' is magnificent as well as the rest of the soundtrack.
4,"I purchased this for my son (4.5). He has just recently become a HUGE Scooby fan. He LOVES it. While I find the dual zipper a bit awkward and the water squeeze bottle rather lame, he loves it just the same. His also did not come with the little sandwich container which was a little disappointing, but he didn't know any better so it's OK. So far he's used it all summer at camp. It stays fairly clean. As with any plastic you have to leave it open at night and wash with a disinfecting solution to keep mold and smells away since it keeps the cold moisture in frm his freeze pack. Overall he AND his classmates Love it!"
4,I wish she would just sing w/o the gimmicky scats. The album is great nonetheless.
4,This product is amazing! it really works! smells like bleach and taste stronger than pool water. But its manageable and doesn't leave your breath smelling like bleach either. morning breath disappears pretty good. you really have to have time to do it because it does take 3-5 minutes to do the whole process each morning and night. i reccommend it completely!
4,"For the price, it is a very good value. There is velcro on the bottom of the bag, so it mounts easily to the side of your trunk. The first aid kit is just some band aids and antiseptic pads, so you will probably want to add some more first aid supplies."
4,"During the tenure of Peter Davision, the Fifth Doctor, there were several one-hour storylines. This is similar to present-day Doctor Who, but different from the 4 to 6 half-hour episodes of most classic Who. The second storyline here, ""Black Orchid"", is notable for placing the Fifth Doctor in the Edwardian time frame for which he always appears to be dressed anyay. It's similar in tone and content to the recent Who episode featuring a fictionalized Agatha Christie in a similar setting. This feels like a natural setting for the Doctor, and especially this one. Enjoy the period costumes, and the bonus of having two complete storylines on one tape."
4,ALL WILBUR SMITH BOOKS ARE OUTSTANDING. I WISH THEY'D MAKE MOVIES OF HIS STORIES...............I HAVE PURCHASED EVERY BOOK HE HAS PUBLISHED!
4,"The holders (jewel cases?) for the DVD's in this set are way too tight. It is difficult to remove the DVD's without bending them, as simply pushing down on the button in the center of the holder does not release the DVD. I ended up putting the disks in regular jewel cases...otherwise the repeated bending would destroy the disks after a while."
4,This is a great continuation for the simpsons series! I love the fun box that it comes in! Its definately worth getting to continue any simpsons collection!
4,"Season six is very solid. It gave us several classics like Homer Badman and A Star is Burns, and contains perhaps the best Treehouse of Horror episode ever. The so-called bad packaging isn't a reason not to buy the DVDs. I haven't had any trouble with mine. It's not half as bad as everyone on here says it is. Yeah, it's a little cheap, but nothing like I was expecting after reading the reviews on here. Grow up, you retards. You don't watch the packaging. If something small like that keeps you from enjoying the episodes then you don't deserve to enjoy them."
4,"I too did'nt like the new package.But I'm not going to give this set 1 star or 2.There are some great episodes in this season.I just received my replacement box,now 6 maches the other 5.I was worried that FOX would make us order replacement boxs for the rest of the series,but I just read the news season 7 will have 2 releases you can get 7 in the new style box,or the old box,I know I'll be getting the old style box.Great job FOX!They listen to there fans."
4,for all that have complained about the crappy box. Here is the moment you have been waiting for it is a grey box wtih a picutre of homer on it with a magnifiging glass and a big eye.I am not sure if the Grey case slides over the orignal becuase it has a big eye but i noticed the pupil was in diffefent directions.
4,"The product came very quickly and is as promised. The exterior box was lightly scratched, which wouldn't have bothered me except I was giving it as a gift and would have liked for it to look nicer."
4,My son (age 18)asked for this movie for Christmas. It was a good movie with morales and the teenagers like it; I liked it as well.
4,"The writer-director-star, Mars Callahan, deserves a hell-of-a-lot more recognition & opportunities to write, direct, & perform.Christopher Walken in a small role is fantastic. Chazz Palmentieri, terrific, too.Just a wonderful movie."
4,Introduction to Windows 98 programming is a good book for beginners. The good thing about it is that it concentrates on the true basics of Windows; that is the Win32. The authors progressively bring the reader throught the concept of Windows Programming and handling the basic resources. The only mention of MFC is in the last Chapter - this is good because MFC can be tough on the beginner. This book is good for the beginner.
4,"Even though I do not understand Arabic language,I feel an ecstasy when Umm Koulthum's playing. I really have no words to describe that woman because there are no words that can give the real value of her voice and personality. I invite you to listen to her just one time, and you'll never hesitate listening to her more and more."
4,I love that this book has such large grids. It makes it a lot easier to makes notes in the boxes and do erasing without making it a big mess. There are different levels of puzzles and some challenging circular and larger puzzles at the end. I definitely recomend this book for Sudoku addicts such as myself.
4,"Sayers has much to offer the British mystery aficionado. Indeed, readers of that genre must inevitably read Both Sayers and Christie for their engaging characters and well constructed mystery plots. This one would be enjoyed most by anyone who fancies bell ringing. It may not be the best example of Lord Wimsey, but it's not bad."
4,"A wonderfully written mystery, with beautiful observations. There are some who say one of the best. For me I can not say, for I have read very few mysteries. I would not call it a page turner, but I do find it quite clever and unique. Perhaps it is because it is written in British vernaculars that makes it somewhat hard to follow.I didn't realize there was such a complex structure behind church bell ringing."
4,"This books is the epitome of the English countryside murder mystery. There's a mysterious dead body, an old parish church, a bumbling rector, and lots of foul weather. When Lord Peter Wimsey's car breaks down in Fenchurch St. Paul he is taken in by the rector. When an unidentified body turns up in the churchyard, Lord Peter is on the case.In Fenchurch St. Paul Sayers weaves a gripping and atmospheric mystery. At the heart of the mystery are the ancient church bells. They are tended by a close-knit and somewhat suspicious coterie of bell-ringers, who display an almost-slavish devotion to their ringing. More broadly, the book is fully infused with bell-ringing culture. The bells give their name to the the book; each has a name and together they are called 'The Nine Tailors.' In all honesty, there was more about bell-ringing than I needed to know. Still, this is a gripping mystery."
4,"This oven is versatile and one we use everyday. There are separate controls for convection and toasting, so we get the benefit of quicker cooking on one and perfect toast on the other. The interior is not large enough to cook a pie (except :) Easy-Bake)but we still get lots of use out of ours."
4,"This is a great little kettle. It only takes about a minute to boil a litre of water, and the handle stays nice and cool (although the body of the kettle does heat up). The entire blue plastic body of the kettle is translucent so although it is not completely transparent, you can see the water level all the way around the body of the pot, which I actually like better than have just a small window to look through. It is much easier to tell at a glance how much water is in there.The flip up lid is nice in that you don't have to take it off to fill up the kettle, but I did find that the opening is a tiny bit too small to comfortably get my hand inside to clean it. The interior design of the kettle is also a bit awkward to reach all the surface bits to clean, but since it is just used for water, cleaning the inside shouldn't be a huge issue.All in all, it is an efficient, sturdy kettle, and much more stylish than many of the others on the market."
4,"I was sad when our previous Braun kettle died after ten years of service. My husband picked out this one and it's been great! I love the cordless design, it boils the water very quietly and its ready bell is not annoying like some other models we've seen. We use ours at least ten times a day. I love it when an appliance just does what it's supposed to!!!"
4,"I bought this toy to go with the sand/water table. It was a big hit right away. My granddaughter and grandson love it, and it keeps them busy for hours."
4,The socks showed up when they said they would and they work as described. Your feet must be somewhat cold to notice the heat but they work well.
4,"Jan has really done an impressive job on explaining USB and how to create applications for it. This is by far the best USB resource that you can get - included with the book is a CD-ROM with Visual C++, Visual Basic and example Tools that you can work with to develop your own USB applications."
4,I find this book to be well-written and comprehensive. The writing style is clear and unencumbered by attempts to be cute or clever. Both the broad overviews and detailed explanations are relevant and accurate. My only complaint is that some of the diagrams (e.g. transfers) have a primitive feel. I would recommend this book without reservation to beginners.
4,My daughter loves this show! I love how it gets her involved and she learns at the same time as she's being entertained.
4,"The story line and music are fun for kids; even our almost-18-month-old granddaughter can't resist dancing to the tunes. The lessons taught by the young pirates (doing what's right, cooperation, kindness) are the kinds of messages we are glad our little ones are learning when they're enjoying these tales. The package said it included a music CD and a pirate eye patch, but we didn't receive either. That's why I only rated this 4 stars."
4,"i have had a number of blenders in my life, but this is definitely the best one i've eber had. great for smoothies! yum!"
4,"This movie was wierd and neat. there was a lot of action and a little bit of every different type of action movie, car chases, guns, explosions, fights....everything and then some. i really liked it but it did have some cheesy moments. I did buy it and decided to keep it after watching it. I have had the incling to watch it again, so that must mean that it wasn't too bad."
4,"The adjustable temp means you don't have to over cook the first waffle like fixed temp waffle makers do. It cooks pancakes evenly, you don't burn one side while the other is still to raw to flip. The ready light on the front means you can see it while sitting at the table."
4,I bought this for the waffle making capabilities and not all the other things that it can do and so far I have only used it for waffles. It makes great evenly cooked waffles. The biggest feature to me was that the cooking plates are detachable which makes for easy cleanup. With my old waffle iron you had to wipe it down with a wet rag and it took a lot longer and more effort to clean. It seems to be a solid waffle maker with the easiest cleanup around. They should all be this way.
4,"Looked at similar products in stores, but they were small this one cooks 4 sandwiches at once. Great product."
4,"I bought this for my daughter and her family. They love it and use it to make all types of foods. They of course make waffles but also pancakes, grilled cheese, hamburgers and so much more. They say it is easy to use and easy to clean. Also it was less expensive at Amazon than at other department stores I looked up online. I would definitly recommend this product."
4,"I am a lover of nice crisp waffles. My old waffle maker quit and I had difficulty finding a new one but AMAZON provided me with the one I wanted. It is great, better than the old one."
4,"I've been after a waffle maker for some time, reading reviews and checking them out online and in the stores. This is a great, very reasonably-priced appliance. Of course the best part is the crispy waffles it produces, but I wanted one where the plates were removable for cleaning - these snap out easily. I haven't used it yet on the grilling side, so can't comment. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that the snap closure is a little metal clip that seems cheap - a smoother clasp would seem more substantial - but if it lasts, all's well."
4,"This grill/baker makes great waffles and is easy to clean. I mist olive oil on the plates and the waffles come out easily and cleanly. I haven't used the grill side of the plates yet. The waffle recipe that came with it was bland and lacking. We only use whole grain flours and this recipe was horrible with whole spelt flour, but we've found other recipes that we love. Beware, the outside of the unit gets very hot!"
4,"This is the 3rd. that I have had. I bought my first one about 15 years ago. I just love this Grill and Waffle Baker. It is the only one in the market that has both features. It makes so easy to cook to perfection wafles, arepas, pancakes, grilled cheese sandwich and even steaks!"
4,Really like the waffle maker. Love being able to remove the griddles and putting them in the dishwasher. Only problem I have with this item is it takes aboout 5 minutes to make a nice slightly brown toasty waffle. The end results are yummy and the versitility (its also a grill!)makes this a winner so its worth the wait. Just wish it baked a little faster. The waffles are jumbo sized so you don't need to make alot of them to fill you up. I know we will be enjoying our waffle maker for many years to come.
4,"Great item, makes delicious waffles and sandwiches too. Not too big, it's a perfect size if your kitchen is small."
4,"I looked all over locally, after spying this one online, to get a bigger waffle iron to supplement my letter-blocks character waffler. I waited 3 weeks through Amazon directly previously and had cancelled my order. Placed this order and it arrived within days.I use it every Saturday to make healthy whole-grain waffles for breakfast and to freeze for the school week. With 4 kids, we go through a lot of waffles and peanut butter for easy before-school breakfasts. The waffles come out fluffy and the perfect size for putting in the toaster frozen. Makes multigrain very well. I do brush veg oil on it about every 3rd time as recommended for safe measure and make sure I have enough oil in my recipe. Taking the grids out to wash is sooooo nice. I used the grill side once to make french toast and it turned out wonderfully too. I highly recommend it as a great multi-use appliance."
4,"I am a coniseur of waffles and this grill makes a great one. It also serves well for making grilled sandwiches. My first one broke after 10 years of weekly use. So while not perfect, I did get a lot of use out of it. Price is reasonable too. Cooks Illustrated also rated this unit a good one for making waffels."
4,"This is very much like the waffle iron I had many years ago and works as well as that one did. It does get very hot to the touch so you must be careful. However, it makes great waffles. I make a full batch and freeze what I don't eat. They are the perfect size to slip into the toaster after that. No waste and a quicker breakfast. I haven't used the grill side yet."
4,"I had used a cast iron waffle maker that I found years ago in a second-hand shop. After several decades of my use, it died and couldn't be repaired. I have tried replacing it with several different waffle makers and none has compared favorably to that old one, until now.Pro - Using the ""Joy of Cooking"" recipe:* The waffles from this maker have a nice texture, have an even thickness, are crisp, and are a nice serving size (unlike the little products from a round maker).Con:* The back half (close to the hinge) of every waffle is always darker than the other half (but never burned or unpleasant tasting).* This waffle maker takes longer to warm up and cooks a bit slower than others I have used.Conclusion:* I ignore the uneven color, and we enjoy some nice waffles!"
4,"I read all the reviews and looked at several different brands, and this was the best choice for the money. We have only used it once (it is now just my wife and I), but it worked perfect. But I made sure we did a few things, like letting it pre-heat, spraying the grills, and making sure we had a good batter made. We had one of the old school ones and made the mistake of letting a family borrow it, and then it was never returned (long story). I like having the abilty to flip the grills, put probably won't. I can also see who the grills could fall out as they are held by two metal clips, but I also see that if that happened, just gently bending those clips in a little would fix it. We do not have any issues with un-even heat or cooking areas. I would recommend this to anyone. Didn't give it 5 stars just because it isn't has ""heavy"" as our old one."
4,I purchased this Black & Decker G48TD grill before Christmas. I am well pleased with it and especially like it for making sandwiches. It toasts both sides of the bread and does an outstanding job.
4,the laptop is perfectly good as new right is it like store bought items like from the apple store huh ?
4,"I have just read this wonderful book and can recommend it toanyone interested in the art of conscious creation. I am a greatfollower of Esther Hicks channelled information and thought I wouldnot need anything else. However this book has added so much more tomy knowledge on this subject and I felt I had reached a state ofcomplete allowing and non-resistence just half way through. If youcan replace the religeious references to God with your ""HigherBeing"" then you will find it very relevant today. I would alsohighly recommend the work of Esther Hicks..."
4,"""Gruber's Complete Preparation for the New SAT"" is truly one of the best SAT Preparation Books out there. Unlike other SAT books that claim to ""Prep. you for the SAT"", this book focuses, not on drill, drill, drill, but on enhancing Critical Thinking skills and teaches the strategies that are needed to successed on the SAT and which will last a life time. Strategies and Critical Thinking Skills taught in this book reflect those of test makers them selves, and is a sure thing for SAT success! I would highly recommend this book to anyone taking the SAT!"
4,"I think this book is very good. The only problem I get with the book is that whenever I write on the book with a pen or pencil, it sometimes breaks the page. So the paper's not very good. However, I found this book very interesting and unique from other SAT books. It offers a very complete SAT at-home preparation and it teaches you Critical Thinking Skills that last a lifetime. I also find this book very easy to read and to understand, and they make their explanations clear, to the point, and easy to understand. It offers a lot of practice tests/quizzes and I find that very helpful. Also, they suggest you memorize the roots of words instead of memorizing a whole word one by one. I can't say if I got a good score on the SAT with this book yet because I haven't taken it yet. All I can say is good luck on your SAT book search!!"
4,"I give the 4th season 4 stars, even though it was dominated by Brooke and Billy, two characters I heartily dislike. Kim was still around stirring up stuff, and Sydney. I look forward to getting Season Five on DVD. It was one of my favorites - lots of good Kim episodes, and Sam arrives near the end of this season. Anyone know when Season Five will be available?"
4,"My three year old daughter received this for Christmas. She loves to set up then sell us snacks. Some of the food (like the donut) are realistic enough that I tried to eat them and was sorely disappointed as soon as I touched it. She also loves the play money, probably more than the set itself. It is portable which means that it is made of paperboard covered in vinyl. If it were sturdier, I would have rated it five stars. I am not sure how long it would last in rough play. I would still recommend it."
4,"I was extremely satisfied with this product except for ""A Fine Romance"". The recording began AFTER a line of the song had already been sung and I had obviously opened the cd case, making it non-returnable. I was, however, EXTREMELY satisfied with the rest of the recordings."
4,"Loved the air pump, but the bed seemed to deflate more and faster than it should have. there was no leak, maybe the wieght was too much. two people might be too much for it"
4,"We bought this bed because we were moving and needed a temporary bed while we looked for a new bedroom set. We slept on it for about 3 weeks. We found it to be pretty comfortable and it stayed inflated. We were ready for a real bed after a week or so but this isn't meant to be a replacement for a real mattress. Overall, pleased with the purchase and happy to have a bed for guests."
4,"we purchased this air mattress for my husband when he took a job working on the road, he says its almost as great as being at home in his own bed!"
4,"I bought this inflatable bed based on the reviews here.It has beaten my expectations. The built-in pump works great and it doesn't take long before the bed is inflated.Also, it stays inflated. We have kept it in our living room for almost a month now as a ""couch"" until our furniture will arrive.During this period we also had a guest sleeping on it for 10 days. I had to inflate it very shortly 2 times.I have slept on other inflatable beds that required inflation during the night.The bed is awesome. Only minus is I expected and ordered the bed to arrive in ""black"", but it was ""army green"". I can live with that."
4,"My wife and I visit my mother often.She has a ""sleeper sofa"",which is far from the truth.Over the years we camped often and tried several inflatable mattresses.None of which lasted long at all due to seam leaks.Reading the reviews on the inflatable mattresses on Amazon we decided to give the Wenzel a shot.I am 6'2"" and 240#'s so for me obviously am skeptical. All in all we are pleased.It inflates and deflates easy,packs up nicely.Our first visit we slept great.I dont think that the mattress loses air but the weight of our bodies stretches the vinyl and the center gets softer.The second visit I over inflated to try to compensate which was a mistake.The outer perimeter became huge and was literally an uphill battle.The last night of the visit I didnt over-inflate and we slept fine.For the money and what it is.........we're very satisfied."
4,"This is a great product allowing comfortable sleep. Easy to set up, but the wide ridge around the edge tends to throw you toward the center of the bed. Good quality construction."
4,"First off, the extension bed is great. From time of delivery to time of putting the bed extension to use was about 30 minutes. Took a little tweeking to get the two pieces aligned but went relatively smooth. Second issue, the packaging for transit sucks. Inside the box they designed the padding poorly (expanded styrofoam). One end had a large block of foam surrounding it the other had little padding at all and in turn one of the plastic foot pads was broken. I was able to make the repair in short order but this should never have happened. A full block of foam padding at both ends would have prevented this."
4,The item arrived right on time is a good kit for not being a high grade kit It's a must have for any gundam wing fan.
4,"A modern-day classic. An excellent, fun, quick read. This book is the inspiration behind so many young novelists of today. Unfortunately, it's also the inspiration by pretentious English Grad Students who wish they could have written this book and have been trying to ape it ever since.But it's a great book. And, by now everyone knows, written in second person. Yeah, yeah, it gets a lot of press for that alone. But look past it and just enjoy the thing. It's a quick read, a real exploration of the 80s, and what it's like to peak young and fade out fast.I could tell you the plot, but just go read it. It's about a magazine drone who becomes a bit of a cad due to his shallow model wife leaving him. It's the 80s, so he drowns his problems in booze and coke. But there's so much more to it than that. And told in such a simple way. Check it out."
4,"I love this CD, it's excellent party music, I always play this cd at partys along with HI-voltage bass"
4,"I borrowed these words from Robert Brinkmeyer, Jr who wrote the book, 'The Art & Vision of Flannery O'Connor' which I read side by side with 'Wise Blood' and the Short stories that he refers to. I am a painter and a southerner, influenced by all the forces Flannery so brilliantly writes about.I am awestruck by her brilliance, her faith, her genius at challenging her reader as she challenged her own faith, her own prejudices. I am humbled to have even read her work. We suffered quite theloss when she died at 39. Ah, Flannery... 'Cheers' to you. You have given me the gift of new visual imagery and challenged me tonew realms of the spirit."
4,"Ok guys, I started out never having owned a sleeping mask in my life and I wanted one for sleeping on the hammock ... No mask came close to this thing... It blocks 100% of light, and this is outside mind you.. the foam is so soft, I can't see how people can call this discomfort! The front is a hard plastic.. very tough.There you have it: the best sleeping mask on the market.Also... I sleep on my side with no problems with this on ... So again... I just don't get the dislikes with people saying they can't sleep on their sides with this mask.. You tighten it up a bit and it works fine, the foam is so soft it doesn't bother me at all.."
4,"This is the story of Libby, a Texan who goes to Rome to marry her true love. Once she arrives things seem to take on a bizarre life. On her way home she meets Ethan Redwine and his family and from that moment on her world is turned upside down.This book has taught me to never judge a book by it's cover. I had this book for awhile before reading it. Now I'm sorry I waited so long. This book is fully of funny characters and incidents. I was cheering Ethan and Libby on from the moment they met. I literally laughed out loud while reading this book. The author did an excellent job of making this story a light fun-to-read experience. It is entertaining from the first page to the last. You won't be disappointed."
4,"fast shipping, product work fine, my new vacuum cleaner parts supplier! i have a eureka contour model no longer made. parts and acc. hard to find they had it . I wish i knew about this company before i ordered more items from a more expensive company who had to back order. it took 3 weeks to get them. ezvacuum company has fast free shipping and great prices. thanks"
4,"THIS ONE WAS MADE BEFORE BUT RELEASED AFTER ENTER. IN THIS ONE, LEE GOES TO ROME TO HELP OUT A COUSIN WHO'S RESTARAUNT IS BEING TERRORIZED BY LOCAL GANGSTERS. YET ANOTHER MASTERPIECE FROM THE LEGENDARY BRUCE LEE. THIS ONE NOT ONLY HAS GREAT MARTIAL ARTS ACTION, BUT IT ALSO HAS GREAT HUMOR TO GO ALONG WITH IT. AND THE BATTLE AT THE END BETWEEN BRUCE LEE AND CHUCK NORRIS IS EXCELLENT. LEE HAS DONE IT AGAIN. HE'S MADE ANOTHER MASTERPIECE THAT WILL BE REMEMBERED FOR YEARS. DON'T MISS OUT ON THIS ONE. AND IF YOU DON'T ALREADY HAVE IT, YOU SHOULD REALLY GET IT."
4,"I used to have Sony MDR-DS3000 but I could not stand the hiss! I bought these headphones after some claimed that there are no background hisses. Unfortunately there are slight hiss in the background when watching TV programming with mostly dialogues. otherwishe the hiss is unnoticeable. I love how the RF transmission allows me to walk around the house while listening to tv unlike the Infrared ones like Sony where you are limited to 90 degree angle in front of the base unit. The connectivity is very good with two toslink inputs, one RCA input, and one toslink output. I have my PS3, cable box, and the dvd player hooked up and its very convenient. I'm not much of audiophile, but as far as I ( an average joe who wants a surround sound for gaming/movies and doesn't want to wake up the neighbor in process) these headphones have great sound. I highly recommend it over any other wireless headphones with surround sound decoder."
4,"I watched Tucker give a preview of his book on C-Span at the Miami Book Fair and couldn't wait to order the book. It was great from page 1 but when I got to page 142 I just couldn't believe what I was reading. Mr. Carlson is totally believable so I have no doubt this is an accurate account.I hope he writes a book like this every year as he does have a knack for interacting with some real ""characters"" in and around the world of politics and the media."
4,"Melodic, atmospheric, timeless ... it's a nice listen. Produced by Dave Dobbyn.8 May, 2006: Grant McLennan, singer-songwriter with legendary Australian group the Go-Betweens, has died in Australia. He was 48.McLennan died in his sleep at his home in Brisbane. It is thought that he suffered a heart attack."
4,My 6 year son and I enjoyed every minute of it. Great workout! It also teaches my son some smoothe hip hop moves.
4,"While not an album it's an excellent single with TDF remixes. The tracks are typical Kraftwerk with their minimalist approach and instantly recognisable style. For Kraftwerk purists the CD is a definitely one for the collection.To the band - Florian, bring on more new music! Awesome concert in Sydney Jan 03!"
4,The chain I received is better than my expectation. One who can get white gold chain in cost of sterling silver? I would definitely recommend this to a friend.
4,First one I received was wrong so I called the Shipper and they sent out the right one right away and got it in 4 day shipper was wonderful to work with.
4,"From my point of view, this is the best version of Shelley`s tale; I have seen Branagh`s, Whale's(and others) but they are all very far from the spirit of the novel... Per Oscarsson and Leon Vitali are fine on their roles... If you like the true Frankenstein, this is your movie....Beautiful landscapes; a very peacefully film... A must see."
4,"Brita Immergut makes math fun! And accessible. There's not much more to say. Except that her publicist should be out trying to book her on every day time talk show in America. She's turned something difficult into something that seamlessly draws kids and parents closer together, and make them smarter in the process. The author deserves a platform and, even more, the huge audience of families who want to learn together. Buy this if you don't just want to work with your kids on math but want quality time together."
4,Good heavy construction and will not topple over. You have to insert the black phenolic holder into the top of the spring and it sits a little crooked. This does not hurt the functionality and it holds the iron solidly. Every tech needs one. Much better than the flimsy aluminum U-stand that comes with a Weller iron.
4,Actually in the middle of watching this DVD set as I write this. Season 4 is probably the best yet and I look forward to seeing the second half of the series. The transfers are excellent and the show plays as well now as it did 40 years ago. Bravo to Paramount and CBS Distribution. Let's see Season 5 before the year 2011 is out!
4,"Mannix is one of the few series from the 60's and 70's that doesn't make you feel like your taste was bad when you first got into it...the show is still slick, fun, and loaded with off-beat storylines and excellent casting. Mike Connors and Gail Fisher carry the show on strength of character, personality, and acting that makes them feel like old friends, while the various supporting players and guest stars, both recognized and unrecognized by today's audience, give the show depth and believability. But the bottom line is that it is great entertainment, like the Rockford Files a few years later perfected. Of note in this release is that Mannix drives a Barracuda convertible for the first time, following the previous years' Plymouth Fury."
4,"This book was delightful to read. It has the flavor of Alexander Smith's Ladies #1 Detective Agency. I wonder if he read this and got the idea to begin his series. It's also a ""feel good"" story as Maisie goes from rags to middle class independent women which is unusual way back around WWI. It's part historical fiction and part mystery. Maisie is intuitive, smart and resourceful.I think you will know if you like this book by the end of the first chapter. It's first in a series and I already have the next one."
4,A fun read with interesting characters that make you think. I enjoyed the viewpoints expressed in the story and I liked the different perspective and the success of Maisie Dobbs as she works to change her station in life.
4,"The primary character in this story is Maisie, a private investigator whose rise from the servant class is due to careful mentoring by her upper class employers. The second character is World War I, seen over time from the horrors of the battlefield to the devastating legacy it left on the minds and bodies of the survivors. Maisie too served in the war as s nurse, and her empathy for the ex-soldiers leads her to investigate an establishment where their lingering traumas are in danger of being exploited. Maisie's complete life is told via a series of long, rather maudlin flashbacks. There is considerably more depth in Winspear's details about ""upstairs and downstairs"" life, her accounts of the war and its aftermath, and in Maisie's physiological approach to her new found trade."
4,Jacqueline Winspear writes with great style. MAISIE DOBBS is the first in this series. It is romantic like CASABLANCA with the same mysterious air. The book is set in wartime England. Both the setting and the characters are very well drawn...you can't help but to care for them as you get to know them. The other two books in this series are BIRDS OF A FEATHER and PARDONABLE LIES. The story continues through these books although they can be read seperate. Each title is strong enough to stand on its own merits. Winspear's book should be added to your permanent shelf whether you like mysteries or not.
4,"Like so many colored pencil how to books, this book names specific colors to use. This is probably the only sure method to achieve the same look as the artist writing the book. I find this is often frustrating because I don't ever have the EXACT colors mentioned. I forge ahead using colors ""somethng like"" as close as possible to the recipe. Yes, this is like painting from recipes. I don't really approve of it all together, but I have to admit, if you do follow the directions to the letter, you most likely will find it easier to create your own mixtures. The examples are very well done. I particularly like the method of drawing the eyes in such a way as to achieve that moist and reflective quality. I would not have been able to get that look without following the pattern as prescribed"
4,"Well worth the money. Gas mileage went up 2.5mpg and there is a slightly noticeable increase in power. Easy to install, only took a few minutes."
4,"I'm always on the hunt for new and interesting travel shows on TV. When I first discovered Aerial America on the Smithsonian channel I knew I found something that would be enjoyable to watch. More than enjoyable, I discovered how beautiful the aerial photography is and how informative the narration of the particular state being shown is. At that point I knew I wanted to have Aerial America on dvd to watch anytime I wanted and to share with others. Until I have the chance to get out there and see more of America for myself I'll enjoy dvds of Aerial America."
4,Great for keeping items from sliding around in the trunk and for transporting the grocery bags home. Folds flat for carrying large items like luggage or large boxes. I would have given this product 5 stars if the side walls were a little taller and a bit stiffer.
4,"I got this in Jan 2011, and there was NO bad odor associated with it what so ever. So it looks like they fixed whatever caused that. Like so many have said, it's pretty rugged, heavy enough so that it doesn't slide (on carpet anyway,) and is easy to reconfigure. The dividers can be removed or repositioned to adjust the storage size very easily. Good product for the money, and much-much cheaper then buying something at the dealer.FYI, I put this in my 2010 Honda CRV. I wish it was a few inches longer, but it's a good fit."
4,"I was concerned that this would not fit in the back of my car, but it fits EXACTLY. I was surprised and relieved. Anyone else with a Scion xB knows how it is with a bunch of groceries back there--now I don't need to worry about opening the back hatch of the car and having strawberries end up in the parking lot."
4,This is a great movie with an interesting plot. I've seen it several times and each time I see something that I missed before. It's a must-have for any movie collection. I think it's one of Arnold's best.
4,"This is by far my favorite Sci-fi action film ever.Bluray quality:video 9/10audio 10/10features 10/10film 20/10I found the video transfer to have grain to keep up to date in today's picture quality, but still a great picture after 22 years.I remember I was 13 years old when this gem was first released on VHS 1990 and many of my classmate friends used to talk about the nude parts of the film back then. XDWow, Nostalgia trip feels like a kid again! I watched this film at least 15 times on cassette VHS, 5 times in DVD quality, now bluray about 3 times on the big home theater PC.This film is a treasure in my movie collection and I look forward to playing the video game episodes on Android OS. Yes, you can use Arnold in the Total Recall android games!"
4,"I'm really enjoying an old classic. The DVD is in great condition, just as described. Thank you for an amazing product."
4,"I think Total Recall is a classic movie. I was extremely excited when I saw it had been released on Blu Ray, and I immediately bought it. Overall, I think the upgrade was nice, and of course I liked the movie itself."
4,I can see why this film is an aquired taste and how some would find it a waste. Personally i thought this movie was very good and quite moving. Amazing cinematography!
4,"This is some early stuff by a great band. It is very good,but they had not reached their peak yet. Great stuff! Check them out!"
4,"This bible even though used is in good condition as Amazon said. Its a great study bible. I'd recommend it to anyone to be used for personal study or with a study group - so helpful, referenced, and easy to use."
4,"The original books are wonderful and tell a wonderful story. You can't go wrong. But I like how the 2002 HBO series started and ended the story the same... The original books do not follow that same premise...""It was Harold's bedtime..."" and ""Harold dropped off to sleep and his purple crayon dropped to the floor."""
4,This is a great book for anyone interested in learning about jade. The color photos are excellent and really show the beauty of the fascinating stone.
4,"These are great...the only way they can improve them is bring down the price! Actually, the price was very reasonable."
4,"Far superior to ""Break it Down."" The stories are clearer, more enjoyable, the lengths are perfect, the language is wonderful. Read ""break it down"" as well -- to see how dramatically better ""Memory"" is."
4,"This dvd/cd rack is pleasing to the eye and structurally sound. It is a breeze o put together, and will even hold up very well without using the gle supplied to secure the joints. I suggest this dvd rack as an economical and overall good choice."
4,"I picked up this book on the off chance when it came into the bookstore that I work at. The title caught my attention. I found the story a little lacking in places, but on the whole it was a wonderful piece of writing. The most lacking part of the story seemed to be the budding romace that was building during the novel. I think that could have been developed a little more to work a bit better with the mystery story line. The blending of fantasy and sci-fi was nice. It is rare when an author can take the idea of the future and combine it nicely with the average aspects of fantasy. I hope that her other books turn out to be as nice of a read as this one was."
4,"i have enjoyed listening to this cd. rosemary clooney is one of the best female vocalists. i love listening to her singing jazz & of course w/ one of the greats, duke ellington. how can you go wrong with this combo??? it is a great listen!!"
4,I've become dependent on this to level up. I use it every time I go out now. Would recommend this as a quick way to level.
4,This was a gift. It was well received. I believe this was his favorite wood working magazine. He enjoyed it.
4,"This wrest is the King-of-all-Rest at any price, but at the price it's offered at, i had to buy two for each of my customer service attendants. They are on their wrists all day long and with the coverage these pads provide, I can feel comfortable i've given them the best comfort available. Sometimes it's the little things you do for your staff that mean the most, and I received the most appreciative ""thank you"" smiles after the first full day these were used. If you have ANY reason whatsoever for a heavy duty wrist rest, this is your best bet!"
4,Classic light hearted comdey with suspense and intrigue that all the family will love
4,"Jessica Lange gives a great performance as the hungarian daughter who's father is accused of war crimes. Well plotted and suspensful, this film was overlooked at oscar time. It should have won a few."
4,"Excellent sound, very good quality, it could include more songs, but this is only what I want from rocky!"
4,"Cables to Go has everything you could possibly need. I have been dealing with them for over a year now and have been very pleased.Either on a professional level or just tinkering, all can be found at CABLES TO GO."
4,"My wired router came with a Cat 5 cable. Why can't companies use better wire like Cat 5e cable. So I changed the Cat 5 to a Cat 6. The price is cheap, so why not.UPDATE- 3/06/11...Cable has been hooked up to my modem since day one. still not a single problem."
4,this brand is far supierior. You can tell by looking at it. It is snagless too.Comes in many colors.Love it
4,"Flowers in the Attic was just the beginning to a wonderful Saga about a family filled with horrible secrets and mysterious endings. Cathy and Chris and their twin brother and sister are locked in the attic of their grandmothers mansion. Until a time-or so told by their mother- that they can leave without the knowledge of their grandfather who is on the verge of dying.V.C. Andrews was a wonderful writer she had seen a side to human nature which is not expressed much in modern literature. For people looking for sex, mystery, and deception this and the rest of the books written by her BEFORE her death in 1986 are works of art. All books written by her Ghost Andrew after her death are just money ploys by the publisher and The Andrews estate to make a fortune off a dead womans name.But if we look at the books written by V.C. Andrew before her death we see a genius who wrote what she felt and wrote what only others fantasize about."
4,"I have read only two books in the series of the Dollenganger family, and this is a thrilling and mysterious novel. Those who haven't read it... SHOULD!"
4,My mom is not as selfish as Corrine(the mother in the book). I could not imagine my mother locking up in the upstairs bedroom and the attic to fulfill her own selfish desires. I can not also imagine her poisoning me like what Corrine did! I could not believe the lap of luxury that she had while her kids were starving upstairs!
4,"This is her best work in my opinion, I love all of her books but this one haunts me still! I felt like I was in the attic with those poor children, feeling the pain that they went through. V.C Andrews has a way of bringing charactors to life!"
4,"This game is great. each level is EXTREMLEY LONG. It never got boring, and I wish there was even more.Thats how fun it was.The graphics are spectacular, and the levels have a puzzle action adventure theme.Buy it NOW."
4,Really has helped reduce inflammation! I purchased it to help with inflammation pain and it has really helped. I also noticed it helps soothe acid reflux problems. Glad I purchased it.
4,"This is an excellent movie. I storyline was pretty good, nothing that would make you roll your eyes throughout. This one is the best Step Up with an actual storyline, if you would rather watch more dancing then check out Step Up 2 the Streets or Step Up 3D. Those have amazing dance scenes."
4,"Great movie. Set in Baltimore, Maryland, the film follows the tale of the disadvantaged Tyler Gage (Channing Tatum) and the privileged modern dancer Nora Clark (Jenna Dewan), who find themselves paired up in a showcase that determines both of their futures. Realizing that they only have one chance, they finally work together."
4,I bought these for my boyfriend to chew on while he was kicking the nasty habit of smoking and it helped keep him distracted and the flavor is strong as well. Good buy.
4,"Prior to my wife's intention to return to college as a mature student, I purchased several books for her on 'Silversmithing', and it is Jinks McGrath's book that she values most highly. In fact her lecturer reccomended it to all the students on the Jewllery Making & Design course. It is an invaluable guide to the beginner with its easy to follow instructions and information. It is well laid out with precise information and an easy reference source to fall back on. You won't be disappointed."
4,"The author includes a wide variety of jewelry making techniques primarily dealing with metalsmithing. Full color pictures wonderfully illustrate each section. Simple wire projects, such as making jump rings to more advanced techniques such as inlaying are shown and described with enough detail to understand, but not overwhelm the reader. I'd recommend this book for the beginner who wants to learn about jewelry making, or for those who just want to learn more about jewelry making. Also included is a Themes section of artistic jewelry that will inspire you."
4,"First, this book is absolutely spectacular. Well thought out and thoroughly presented.If you expect to interact with people and exchange information, you need to read this book. Being part of society is what makes societies and governments function. Without some level of connection/involvement between people, nothing would be accomplished.Read and re-read... it will change the way you think, and even possibly make you a more enriched person..."
4,"Went the HP route first. Couldn't get it to work. Tried everyting. Punted! Bought the Espson and fired it up on the 1st try. Have had it for about 3 months now and coupled with an HP p1000 printer, I can duplicate, and I mean duplicate pictures. Scaned a professional 8x10 of my little boy to near perfection. The Twain software is great. Only down side is at times I need to place some thick stock paper behind the picture so I don't scan ""through"" it. I am now putting photo archives in the computer weekly. Very simple to use and quick. Great to be able to adjust BPI from 300 to 2400 based on what you want."
4,I thoroughly enjoy Tyler Perry's Videos. A needed point is always addressed in his media.
4,This is one of the best plays that I've seen. It is well written and extremely funny.
4,"Avalon is, quite simply, one of the most lovely records ever made. It has a sumptuous sound, it's power is in it's simplicity, and a great ensemble effort. The band works as a cohesive unit, none upstaging the other or interrupting the mood with a particularly wicked solo. Bryan Ferry's amazingly lush vocals carry the mood completely from emotion to emotion, and the melodies linger for a lifetime.I go back and forth between this record as my all-time favorite, and HATS by The Blue Nile, which is breathtaking in a very similar way. Yet I never seem to be able to let go of Avalon, and my guess is once you hear it, you won't be able to let it go either."
4,"Romantic is the first word that comes to mind. After 25+ years this album is timeless in it's music and relevantcy. I just bought it again for my girlfriend and it makes her, lets say, more than frisky. The band is tight and masters of nuance. Bryan Ferry, well is Bryan Ferry. Brillantly he casts a spell of image and tone that takes each listener to a place in their life they have been or dream of being. Excellant production quality. When I turn the lights low and with my lady the night starts of mutual appreciation, this album amplifies the our spirit."
4,"Product is good. There is a very slight amount of edge left around my PSP3000 screen that isn't covered, but it is too thin to be a problem. I use this in tandum with a silicone skin case (purchased on amazon) which provides near complete protection for my PSP. And you can't be the price of these screen protectors."
4,"I first saw this film, in the theatre, before DVD's came out. I ended up seeing it six times. At the time I thought I was loosing touch with reality, but, no, it's just that good, that poignant. I now live on a tropical island in the South Pacific, and have to special order DVD's. Field of Dreams will be my next order."
4,"Beautifully realized, old-fashioned fantasy movie that raises the spirit and touches the heart. James Earl Jones provides magnificent support as a reclusive writer who joins Kinsella on his crusade, and Ray Liotta is also solid playing ""Shoeless Joe ""Jackson. Goes down just as well on repeat viewings."
4,"This a compelling retelling of Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey in a contemporary American genre. Kevin Kostner, James Earl Jones, and Burt Lancaster provide acting heft to a modern myth that many men, including this reviewer, have found moving and powerful. The ""Atonement"" or, as Campbell called it, At-One-Ment with the father, provides the psychological depth and insight that makes this a classic. You don't have to be a baseball fan to fall in love with this movie. It's really about finding your Self, as Jung would say, or your ""bliss' as Campbell said, or that ""place where dreams come true"" as John Kinsella says at the end of the movie."
4,This is a great movie! Kevin Costner is awesome in this film. I have always enjoyed this story and now I have passed it down to two younger generations to enjoy.
4,"This movie is definitely for guys. But I know a lot of guys who will cry watching this movie including myself. It's such a wonderful film. So much symbolism. I have watched it about 60 times total and still get teary near the end when Ray is having a catch w/ his father. Not too much more I can say about it, but AWESOME!"
4,"Works, looks good. The soldering areas wet easily and it withstands my clumsiness. The pins look thinner and less shiny than the Mohawk brand though. I don't know if that's good or bad."
4,"Hello. I am actually the author of the book. If you as a woman struggle with your self esteem, this book may inspire you to value and honor your feminine identity, something that women who are successful by patriarchal standards have to contend with. The second theme of the book is to envision a society with the masculine and the feminine qualities in balance."

4,My son loves Rock n Learn videos. Between these and LeapFrog he has learned his alphabet and sounds rather quick.Highly recommended.
4,"A tour-de-force of style and substance -- one of the funniest, best-written novels I've read in a long time."
4,this is a very nice pencil that won't disapoint you. the lead is impossible to break and it ships rather QUICKLY.
4,A great magazine subscription for kids. My daughter grew out of it at about age 12 but I highly recommend this.
4,"Llewellyn's Magical Almanac is an excellent resource, I buy one every year and keep them in my library; I have ten year's worth of them now! A variety of contributing authors makes this almanac a must-read each year."
4,"This 384-page almanac is chocked full of articles with daily info on moon phases and other needed info. I like the listing of the days instead of trying to cram all the info into a calendar form. The articles or chapters, are all well written and can be read within a half hour for most so it is easy to pick this book up, pick a spot within the book and just read. You don't need to start on page 1 and probably shouldn't! I'm now going to look for 2006 just to read all the articles."
4,"This item is exactly what I expected and just as some other the others described. I wouldn't take it out to the bush, but it is perfect for transporting my weapon to and from the range. I consider this a Good value for the money."
4,This is a great gun case. It fits my weapon in it very nice. I like the looks of the case and how easy it is to operate. I would recommend this to everyone for the price you get more than you would expect.
4,This is a very well built case at a really great price! Bought to keep a .177 caliber air rifle away from younger kids...has holes for padlocks!
4,"The Sleepy Jackson hail from the left-coast town of Perth, Australia. The band is the brainchild of singer-songwriter Luke Steele, who both displays and betrays a wide range of musical influences on this 13-track debut album. The George Harrison-inspired opening cut ""Good Dancers"" is dominated by producer Jonathan Burnside's soaring slide guitar and underpinned by complementary violin and viola parts. Next in line is the Velvet Underground-styled rave-up ""Vampire Racecourse,"" which features atonal honky-tonk piano seemingly borrowed from David Bowie's ""Aladdin Sane."" Elsewhere on the album, Steele showcases a penchant for country-rock on tunes such as ""Acid in My Heart"" and ""Miniskirt,"" which sounds like the companion piece to the Rolling Stone's classic ""Dead Flowers."" The deft musical arrangements throughout the album help ensure the proceedings don't become overly-derivative. While Luke Steele may wear his influences on his sleeve, it doesn't spoil the shirt."
4,"What more can I say? This is a sensational album by a pretty weird looking band (Luke is pretty eerie - but a genius all the same). However there are so many moments of pure magic on this album that it blows me away every time I listen to it. It is one of thise albums that takes hold of you and forces you to listen intently. As the other reviews have mentioned, Lovers has a strong Beatles influence (a fantastic thing on its own) however doesn't sound cliched at all - on the contrary the mixing of styles eg country, new wave and classic 'late Beatles influenced'rock/pop makes this an experience I recommend to any lover of great rock/pop music. Grab this with The Shins 'Chutes Too Narrow' and you will have the best two releases of recent times."
4,This is an amazing soundtrack. I love all of the songs on it. For all of you who are disappointed because the two best songs from the movie were not included on your copy of the soundtrack there is good news. The soundtrack has been rereleased and it includes both 'wild summer nights' and 'tender years' on it. Those two songs are by far my favorites from the movie and they are the reason why the soundtrack gets five stars from me. It's great!
4,"Music means different things to different people. This music has heart, which envelopes ones senses to the fullest and touches the soul."
4,"It's Great, I had to do a report and it gave me all the information I needed, I did'nt read it because I had to do this Report, It was fun to read."
4,Nice color. I had to leave it in overnight to get the full color effect in my hair. Depending on the lighting it goes from rather blue to bright purple and somewhere in between.
4,"I really love the quality of the scans that I have made. This scanner scans quick and clear (my old scanner scanned really slow and very dark). However, I have had a strange problem with installation. Every once in a while, my usb port will not find the scanner and I have to reinstall the driver. This has only happened twice and does not take more than a minute, but it is still annoying. The lid is designed to raise slightly so that you can scan a thick book, however, you cannot remove the lid if you want to scan objects. Overall, I am very pleased with the scanner."
4,"Dear Sir or Madam: I am pleased with the content, clarity and illustrations in the Dorland's Med Dictionary.However, when I received it in the torn, dirty, padded envelope I was disheartened. The corners of the book were damaged and the book had come three-fourths of the way through the one end of the package. The package looked as though it had been thrown and could not withstand the impact of the rough handling in shipping. The book was too heavy for the mailer. This 6-pound volume should have been shipped in a hard cover - box.I really needed the book, due to beginning medical classes, so did not return the same."
4,"We're told that the packaging for this signature men's fragrance interoduced in 1999 was inspired by Boucheron's collection of watches. The bottle did, indeed, win an award.A rich, ripe fragrance redolent of Verbena, Moss, Sandalwood, and Vanilla Boucheron Pour Homme is a one of a kind scent.Long recognized as makers of elegrant, luxurious jewelry Boucheron began in 1830 when the first store opened in Paris. It was not until 1988 that the first Boucheron fragrance was launched.Boucheron remains in family hands today, the president being the founder's great-grandson, Alain Boucheron. To me, that bespeaks pride in and attention to product. Both of which benefit the consumer."
4,interesting video. would recommend it if you want to learn basic card counting and more.
4,So interesting and so well done! This is a great DVD> Anyone over 45 will have a trip down memory lane! An excellent tranfer too!
4,"This work commisioned by the Left Book Club, a socialist group in England in the 1930's contains an incredible description of the miserable working conditions of coal miners in the northern industrial areas of England. Orwell's power of description brings home the awful condiditons to the reader in a very tangible and palpable way. Reminiscent of Jacob Riis' ""How The Other Half Lives"" or Upton Sinclair's ""The Jungle"", Orwell's account is unforgettable social historical writing.The remainder of the book is a polemical piece critical of socialists of his day. To the modern reader that will not have as much relevance except as an example of Orwell's pursuasive writing but the earlier sections of the book are incredibly memorable."
4,this is visual reading of gods word and I love itIt helps me visualize the book of Luke correctly
4,"The product is very comfortable but it can be more useful if it was bigger, I am using it in a restaurant."
4,I put this CD on the minute I step into the office in the morning. I like his renditions of many of my favorites that he has included on the CD. It is so relaxing. Great background music for a hectic office setting. And I feel transported back to that part of the world. Well done.
4,"I absolutely LOVED this book; however, I found one problem with it---it's too short! I would've loved to read at least a hundred pages more."
4,"This book is an excellent collection of information on child abuse, covering subjects from the history child abuse to specific types of child abuse to rehabiliation to prevention, and much more. Although this edition is a bit outdated and thus lacks some of the more recent information and research, it's still highly relevant and in my opinion should be required reading not only for doctors, psychologists, and school teachers, but also for anyone who interacts with children, and indeed, the entire population."
4,"Many might frown at Gunther Schuller's lengthy, and by no means completely coherant, work on orchestral leadership. This book is not for the beginner. Here is a book for the music lover - to prove once and for all that great conducting does not come from the conductor's own ideas alone - as he [Gunther] restates something Ravel once told musicians: ""do not 'interpret [what has been written in the score] ' - ""REALIZE"" what the score itself is saying to you!"" Just one of Gunther's many messages: The score, written by the sole person who fully understood it, tells you what it wants. Don't ignore that without careful thought, and of course, 'compleat' understanding."
4,FAST EFFICIENT SERVICES FROM SHIPPER. I ADDED THIS TO MY LIBRARY ALTHOUGH I HAVE NOT READ IT YET. WOULD USE THIS SHIPPER AGAIN
4,"Christian Bale is one of the greatest actors of his generation. That said, the Machinist is a unique psychological thriller in that the protagonist looks like Death warmed over. Bale is so bone-thin, it lends to the fear factor and the realism.The story is about Trevor Resnik, a loner machinist who works the graveyard shift. Strange events begin to occur, and Trevor believes there may be a conspiracy against him. As the viewer is drawn into his world, brief moments of happiness, respite from the fear, do not last long before we are plunged into another waking nightmare. We long for release for Trevor, and it is granted at the end, but not after a bit too long of a rollercoaster ride of mental adrenaline.Recommended, but I recommend the futuristic action film Equilibrium more. Bale is his best here, physically (thank God) and of course in acting ability."
4,This movie is so cool. It will keep you guessing and on your toes until the very end. I highly recommend this movie to anybody that loves suspense movies like Fight Club or The Usual Suspects that keep you guessing on the ending. Best movie.
4,"This bleak, gloomy and sinister must be seen keeping in mind four previous films in which the mental breakdown is exposed with meridian shock; these four ones would be Repulsion, Brazil, Shock corridor and The tennant.For many young audiences and newcomers the film may seem weird with certain touches of surrealistic hints. This movie requires from you a total commitment with the semiotic lexicon.If you liked Memento, for instance or Mulholland Drive, place your bet with this one.Kudos for Christian Bale whose artistic conviction is out of discussion. having lost 69 pounds talks by itself.This work must be included among the best twenty cult movies of this decade."
4,This is a morality tale about consequences and responsibility. It reminds me of old school solid filmmaking that we never see anymore.
4,"Probably most of all the AMPAS (Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences) members and the usual Hollywood cinema crowd doesn't give a [...] or even knows who Christian Bale is. However once he hits the scene in 2005 as the new and improved film version of Batman everyone will ask themselves ""Who is this dude""?. Then they will discover American Psycho and The Machinist. This is why the Hollywood film industry [...] and so do the idiots who pay to see the uncreative CGI mess they churn out. The only thing worse than the crappy films is the wasted 35mm motion picture film and the lame print ads that are used to advertise the [...]. Props to the Underground Independent Film Scene. The Machinist rules. Go see it (even if your not a Machinist). Buy it when it is released on DVD. Rent it if your a cheap [...]. Otherwise consider yourself a pinhead that enjoys [...]."
4,A beautiful story about determination and success against all odds. I've shown this film to addicts and alcoholics seeking recovery and the reaction was totally positive.
4,"All of the cooking utensils by Calphalon are great, ordered all new. Quality, feels good in the hand and dishwasher safe. I would recommend this Nylon Spoon and all of their utensils."
4,"One wonderful thing about human variety is that it brings so many different faces and figures to the word ""beauty."" Allen devotes this book to one range of that beauty, the one dominated by its African heritage. Even that, as these photos show, covers a fair range in itself.Many of these photos focus on the hair, the curves, the lovely faces, and other features that distinguish black beauty from the other kinds. The net effect, to my eye, does not set black beauty apart. Instead, these photos display the beauty common to women everywhere, with a few genetic highlights to remind the viewer just varied that can be. This brings an enjoyable and welcome complement to collections that often under-represent this branch of the human family.-- wiredweird"
4,"I have heard this man preach for many years, and read several of his books. This particular one, brings out things from an historical view of the charasmatic/pentecostal view. It helps to establish the history of the ""gifts of the Spirit"" and helps show where they have been in the christian movement through out history.I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to start their search of pentecostal history.Shalom, and God bless,"
4,"I have had the fortunate experience of visiting Japan twice and seeing some Japanese baseball. It was an experience I shall never forget. Curious about the subject I picked up and read this awesome book. However, as much as this book is about baseball. And it is filled with some great stories and information. I wonder how much this book is really about the cultural differences between the United States and Japan. Using the history of Japanese baseball and the rough experiences of many of the American players who have tried to play in Japan, the author does an awesome job teaching about Japanese culture. This is much more than a baseball book. Its about baseball and culture, and cultural diffusion, and the differences between Americans and Japanese. This is a funny book, a fun to read book, but you will learn alot about Japan by the time you are done. I have even assigned this book to my students. This book is worth it. An unforgettable read."
4,I enjoyed this book so much that I went out and did quite a bit of research on my own about the Japanese leagues. It is entertaining and at the same time you will be educated. I recommend this one to anyone who loves baseball or is interested in the Japanese culture.
4,"I really like it when a book not only refuses to let me put it down but also catches me off guard. Words I'd use to describe this book would be clever, witty, suspenseful and exciting."
4,The first time I played this game was the first release I thought it's a unique game original. After a few years they release this version which was a big upgrade newer thing added. I am very found with game I wish there were going to be a new version for it.
4,"This was an 80s series that centered around an american sharing a flat with two other roommates from the UK. Matthew (the vain macho man who's afraid to leave the apartment), Martin (the nerdy guy) and Mandy (the beautiful blonde who attracts losers) live together in this first of three series total. There are six episodes in all:Big WednesdayWorking GirlsThe Great EscapeBad TimingMatthew - A Case For TreatmentFameMatthew is the brash american who thinks too highly of himself. Martin is the wimpy guy who always gets picked on, especially by Matthew. Mandy is the good looking blonde with great ambitions but with little to back it up. Both men sniff at her heels but never get anywhere. A very funny series that is different from american comedies. Some episodes are funnier then others but all are amusing."
4,"Although lots of listeners rave about this recording, it's quit different from most of his other work. There are few melodies, and fewer chord changes. Don't get me wrong, I like it well enough, but I think Mingus's best pieces all have at least one of these two. Hear, e.g., the songs on Pith. Erectus, Blues and Roots, Mingus Ah Um, The Clown, Revenge, to name a few. If you want to hear a long piece, I'd suggest ""Meditations"", say on Town Hall Concert (OJC)."
4,"If you want to hear on man's inner torment, confusion and resolution set to music, this is it. From the opening snare strikes that sound like a cross between gunfire and a death march to the sublime, serene and beautiful piano intro that opens track 3, replete with flamenco guitar breaks and some frightening plunger-muted trombones that sound eerily human, there is simply nothing else like ""The Black Saint...."" in all of jazz, nor in all of music! For long form jazz composition this is impossible to beat though many have tried. Mingus' Masterpiece."
4,"I kind of laugh at all the smoking that goes on in this book, but it was good. I love Clive and have read most all of Dirk's adventures. Not sure how I missed this one, but glad I found it. Short and sweet."
4,"Story that seems to transport plane enthusiasts back in time to the days of bi-planes and the First World War. Many of the important components are there: guns, bombs, planes and a woman. Great read."
4,"I must admit is was a bit suprised to find out that Darius was secretly working for Erik. Even more so suprised to find out that Erik was had took someone else's identity. He almost would have pulled it off, however he was going up against Dirk Pitt."
4,"I just received this bag two days ago, 3/21/07, and I'm happy with the quality and the size of it. It EASILY holds my Gateway 17"" screen laptop...and all of the extras I need to carry. True, the vinyl doesn't look like real leather, but real leather would become spotted in wet weather whereas vinyl can just be wiped clean. One expectation I had that WAS NOT met: side-padding. The bottom of the bag has a little interior foam padding (and little metal feet on the exterior to protect the bottom of the bag when put on the ground), but the sides of the bag offer no additional padding, pockets for everything :) but no padding. This is my first computer bag, so maybe the bags aren't made for side impact, but I was expecting more protection from a laptop bag. If I ever need to take my computer on a lengthy trip, I'm going to put a folded towel around my laptop. I recommend the bag, but I wish it had more padding."
4,"This is a great little case for my CF cards. I like the rubbery material the inside is made out of. I think it protects my cards well. If I ever have the need for more cases, I will buy more of these!"
4,This edition is the ultimate Fastball - from 'the way' live to 'youre an ocean' you cant lose! Billy and Brian Setzer add SO much! and than the background orchestra.......wow!
4,This book was amazing. To read a first hand account of what life is for Muslim who converts to Christianity was mind boggling. It made me realize how blessed we are. I admire the courage that she had to endure the price that was paid for her conversion. It reinforced how the Lord goes before us when we are in His favor and doing His will. It reminded me of our God is really our Father and we should remember that and call Him Father when it is appropriate. I recommend this to any one who wants to know what being a Christian in a Muslim country is like.
4,"Sean Connery's last Bond film for thirteen years; (Never Say Never Again would be his absolute last Bond film in 1984),Connery, if a little heavier around the waistline, and perhaps slightly more folically challenged is still the Bond to beat! Charles Gray is great as Ernst Stavro Blowfelt, adding more refinement and cynicism to a character previously portrayed by Donald Pleasance (1967's You Only Live Twice). Jill St. John is quite good as diamond smuggling, red head Tiffany Case, and Desmond Llewelynn is, as always, perfect in the role of ""Q"". Now famous Las Vegas chase seen is stuff of legend and righfully so, but look for Mustang to enter alley leaning on right two wheels, and exit alley leaning on opposite two wheels? The locations shots are magnificient, (a Bond trademark) Overall, a fitting salute to, in my opinion, the best actor to ever don the James Bond gear! Truly worth watching."
4,"After a one film hiatus, Sean Connery returned one last time to play super agent James Bond in the Eon Bond Series. Connery is back and in fine form as he tracks down some ruthless diamond smugglers out to hold the free world at ransom with a strange new secret weapon. Here is where the Bond series started it's campy 70's silliness, which mars this Bond effort down a notch. Even some of the action sequences fall flat in this one (especially the moon buggy bit). Only the Vegas car chase and the elevator fight stand out. Still ""Plenty"" to enjoy in this one. Jill St. John makes for a sardonic and sensuous love interest as Tiffany Case. One could have wished Natalie's kid sister Lana Wood had a bigger role as Plenty O'Toole, though. You Only Live Twice returnee Charles Gray is the least effective Blofeld in the series, but he has fun with it. Bruce Glover and Putter Smith are hilarious as the two gay assasins, Mr. Wint and Mr. Kid.***1/2 out of *****"
4,"Learned of Sufferer, A Survivor Parody, in Forbes (Jan. 8th, 2001 issue) and couldn't be happier with it."
4,I absolutely love my new sandals. They were in perfect shape and had the prettiest packaging. I think they may be my favorite pair I own and the price was amazing. I got them very fast also. Thank you so much and I will definitely buy more from this company!! E
4,"Although I'd only seen a dozen or so episodes on TV, that was enough to convince me that The King of Queens was a must-have collection, and that I had to see it all, right from the very beginning.The show must have been great fun to write and film, because the high standard of each episode's story-line, the excellent chemistry between the talented actors, and the lively vibe that the show exudes, is so infectious.Along with the Everybody Loves Raymond, and 'Till Death series, I just love the clever and insightful comedy that is contained within the nuances, and the highs and lows of grown-up human inter-relationships.This show delivers a truckload of laughs!"
4,"Simple, very fast, no hassle, no problems - the perfect purchase. Makes shopping a pleasure."
4,"I really love watching this show cause it is so very hilarious, Kevin James is extremely funny, I really enjoy watching this show & his movies"
4,I like this product. I got 4 of them on EBay for the same price and less shipping. But the product is good if you like your hair soft.
4,"The performances on this CD are uniformly great,from the rockin' to the sultry.Someone at Verve did a very good job selectingthe tracks and artists whose versions are on here.I think Cole himself would dig them."
4,"In the middle of the raging, multi-front conflict, Oz realises, as a half-wolf, he smells Angel. Buffy and her old friends head there to find out what is going on, and find a trap, and Camazotz.The rest of the Council teams are head pressed, even using the young Slayer Anna and Wesley as relief troops, and Buffy must face Giles alone so the others can go back and try and save some of their people.After this, Buffy and Willow realise Buffy needs to go back to her own time to the right moment where she makes the fatal mistake and allows this future to happen.Working this out, with the help of Lucy Hanover, she comes back, but again a desperate battle when her, the Scoobies and Camazotz and his Kakchiquel must be fought at the harbour."
4,This is a great book with lots of valuable information. It can be a great reference for skin care professionals.
4,This camera has to be the best point and shoot digital camera on the market for the price and for the Sony quality it produces on the picture it takes and the the fine quality it can print. I am so please with this camera as i was with another Sony point and shoot i owned. Pure Sony quality with all the bells and whistles a digital camera can produce.
4,"I received this camera for my b-day. I am a scrapbooker and I like to take my camera with me when we go different places. Our big Cannon (10x optical zoom) is great, but too bulky for day-to-day use. I wanted something easy to slip in my purse, easy to carry when visiting family during the holidays, and basically something simple to grab when one of my ""kids"" does something cute! So far, this seems to fit the bill to a ""T""! I just love the 6 mega pixil and can't wait to get my first set of photos back."
4,Everything was as stated and of good quality.The shipment was within the time frame and the packaging was very good. I would reccomend this product.
4,"The I Spy Spooky Mansion was our first experience with the I SPY computer games. My family and I LOVED it. My daughter is 8 and my son is 4 and we found ourselves playing the game for several hours straight. The game can be just a plain seek and find for my 4 yr old, but can bring out the logical thinking for my 8 yr old. I highly recommend this game, and I am eager to try all the I SPY games!"
4,"Scrabble has been an integral part of our family for over 50 years. The originators (Grandmother and her sisters) were highly competitive and were totally against the idea of looking up words prior to playing. But, in order to encourage the game with the fourth generation, the rules have been relaxed.As a result, this book is extremely helpful to teach adding on to words and multiple-word plays. While it just consists of alphabetized lists, we make it a rule that you also have to look up the meaning of the word in the Scrabble dictionary, if not known.But beware... while the book is fairly complete, there are some words that are not included which can be found in earlier editions of the Official Scrabble Dictionary.So, the recommendation is, this makes a fun and wonderful companion book, but should not be relied on alone."
4,"For anyone interested or entertained by comedy and music this a must have.The Secret Policeman's Balls were the biggest thing in entertainment. They were for Amnesty International and nothing like them had been done anywhere on this scale before. This set is a compendium of a key moment in entertainment history, literally at a turning point in Western culture.It couldnt be duplicated today."
4,"I bought these through another source, I'll admit that up front. They didn't say on their web-site that these weren't the versions originally cut for U.S. release back in the 80's. I desperately wanted to see Neil Innes performing, ""Urban Spaceman"" again. But it's not here. Not even in the EXTRAS. There are some things I don't remember seeing back then, and some of them are pretty note-worthy (I can't swear to seeing a pre-Dr. Who Sylvester McCoy do his red-hat and strip to his tidy-whiteys escape routine back then... but that was 25 years ago... the little gray cells are the first thing to go!!). If they ever want to make a decent amount of money for Amnesty, I suggest they gather up all the bits that were shown in the U.S. version but left out of this, the original british (international?) version, and put them all in a new release. My two cents. Thanks."
4,"When the bought this cd, i expected a carbon copy of alexisonfire first record after hearing 'Accidents'. But this is totally different from the self titled debut. As you probably have read, or heard, alexisonfire sing on this album. A whole lot of singing. Very good vocals, and at times you just wonder if this is the same band. Also, its obvious they have taken critics advise and cut down the long intros, which i honestly didnt mind. But this album doesnt have many long intros compared to the selftitled.I would defiently recommended this for fans of Emery, because at times they sound a lot like the mellow side of Emery. This album is brutal, melodic, and beautiful all at the same time. I would rate this one the best of 2004 alongside the Emery record.Overall, a very good album, and the recording sounds 1000x better then the self titled. Alexisonfire have moved to a different direction with this. Hardcore fans might miss all the screaming though."
4,"CDNow offers previews for a reason, so people can her the stuff before they buy a CD. If people were smart enough to preview this stuff they would know the amount of screaming and emotion in the songs. Instead they buy it and complain about the money that they just wasted. This CD is Amazing, pure and simple. If it screaming you like buy it. The lyrics will rip you apart. I saw these guys down at warped tour and holy crap some of the best stuff, there is so much energy. Usually I'm not much of a fan for a lot of screaming. But the guitar work alone makes up for it. The guitar is just mind blowing to me, I love how technical it gets. But I warn you, if you don't like more screaming then singing don't buy it. This isn't always for everyone, especially people who don't like to keep open minds about music. Screaming isn't all that bad. I find it even more emotional than screaming, if you ever catch some of these lyrics you will understand. Definitely check them out though."
4,"Ok first off I despise 99% of all screamo,emo,hardcore,metalcore, blahblahcore bulls**t bands that have molested music of this day and age. This cd proves there is a light among the dark.The melody and atmospere of this album is something to be reckoned with. I could give less than a s**t about the pathetic emo lyrics and the screaming kept me from giving it a 5 star rating, but the music still redeems this band from genre obscurity. If these musicians can distance themselves from the cliche's of music today, they might possibly have a chance to survive the coming death of emo themed music for it is almost opon us. I am personally glad of that."
4,"I haven't listened to this album much, but I've been through every track once. It is a bit different from the last album, but one thing is the same for sure... the amazing instrumentals. George's voice is a little different.. he sounds older (because he IS omg!!1) But Wade and Dallas still do some singing (entire songs too omggg!!11!) and they sound even better than the last album. I'd say if you are a fan of Alexisonfire, or just someone looking to buy a good album, then pick this up. 4 out of 5, just because so far, I liked the last album a little bit more."
4,"Well I searched alot for the best, and I bought the Peg-Perego but it was the worst! I had to exchange it three times. So finally I saw the reviews on the Chicco Cortina, and decided to go with it. Well all the reviews were right on, this is the best system. It is easy to use, and very nice. I dropped some juice on it and it cleaned right up! How NICE.... And EASE! wow, the stroller really can be closed with one hand. The infant seat is very lightweight, and the stroller with the adjustable handle... I just cant say enough, I just wish I had purchased this one first and never had to experience the other one.The Chicco Cortina is hands down the best system out there."
4,Gift to my younger grandson Noah and he just loved it. Having the magnetic was a big hit with him.
4,"Season 3 of Def Poetry Jam is my favorite thus far. The guest poets are great !! Smokey Robinson really surprised me with his poem and the message he sends to everyone is nothing less than the truth. Jill Scott also does an awesome job ...!! I highly recommend all three seasons because Def Poetry is something you can watch over and over and over ... it's NEVER a boring moment ... and you can LEARN a lot !! Southernly Yours, Daphne (Always A Southerngirrl)"
4,I wish it had been a text for one of my classes. Had to discover it later. Well...a worthwhile discovery. It doesn't get 5 stars only because I hardly ever give anything 5. Probably 4.75.
4,"My son Mikey loves to build. He is 5 , not only does he build what is in the books , but he makes up things on his own. He has 4 knex sets as well as the serpent. As long as your child likes to build I highly recommend knex."
4,"I play this all the time, and enjoy it as calm and peaceful background music any time of day. Highly recommend."
4,"I have read alot of (somewhat) negative reviews of this album and I just don't get it. I bought it only because I had heard Dear Prudence on digital cable's jazz radio station, and was surprised to find that two of my absolute favorites in the field of music (Matt Chamberlain and Jon Brion) were on the bill as well. I love traditional jazz but I really love when people push the limits of music and this album does exactly that. The songs are hauntingly beautiful, poignant, and at the same time just rippin' with energy. If you're a jazz purest you probably can't handle this album. But if you like to hear some great, innovative music performed by totally SICK (good) musicians, check out this album.This was my first introduction to this amazing painist and his incredibly expressive playing. I can't wait to dive into the rest of his catalogue. Your's truly--One very inspired (and grateful) musician."
4,"Rock isnt dead as long as really exciting musicians like bard and his gang are not feared (as in this cd) to iprovise with the music of their teenage years (in attitude and passion). This cd is a turnover in brad's till now work and is reaaly amazing how he again takes a song of radiohead (paranoid android) as was exit music in trio's vol.3 and makes a classic out of it....although some may say the album is too crowded with technology, all thumbs shoul get up for the guts to put out an album like this. Listen to sabbath and get deep into your days of teenage pessimism. I could never imagine what his next step would be....but all those mentores who find his music boring can now shut up for good.....brad will rock you....by the way i think the pice boomer should get into this album as well....cu soon live brad."
4,"This live set is very impressive. The sound is excellent. When I put it on, it just makes me feel relaxed and really good. It's a thrill to hear such enthusiastic crowds cheering on this strange, bubbling, mechanical music. Some people claim Kraftwerk is old hat, but I say it's too unique to sound dated. I've never been one to care much about how current or fashionable music is anyway. In these live settings, Kraftwerk augments these songs and makes them sound fresh. In fact, I now prefer to hear these versions over the originals!"
4,"Kraftwerk Minimum-Maximum is a Live double cd. I enjoyed it, But My favorites are Radioactivity and the best of the best : ""TransEuropeExpress"" .Good cd full of bizarre sounds and beats. TransEuro Is worth it. Of course I would prefer if it weren't Live."
4,"Best warm weather jersey my team has ever purchased. Breathes exremly well and holds up in the wash. If your team plays in warm weather anyplace this is the jersey for you. During winter ball, throw a long sleeve t-shirt underneath and your good to go. Hardly feels like your even wearing a jersey and the fit is great."
4,I am very pleased with the Jumble Madness Puzzle books I ordered. I expect to have hours of fun solving the many puzzles.I can only think of one thing that I would change - I would have two puzzles per page and have them printed smaller as I feel they are too large.
4,I bought this 3 years ago and have had it plugged in and running almost all the time. It continues to work perfectly. The large circular filter only needs vacuuming every couple of months and the outer filter you change every three months. It takes an amazing amount of junk out of the air. It sits in my bedroom so it also provides a 'white-noise' background that is soothing. This unit is not ultra quiet but that's OK because it cleans the air so well. This unit is the real deal and not a light weight piece of junk. We love it.
4,"Louisville is the second worst city in the US for allergies and this has been the worst spring season for allergies in a long time, but my home has been my safe haven because of this purifier. I do not recommend the seller though. I origanally purchased it from the seller on this site they immediately charged my credit card and notified me that my item was ready to ship, but a week later when I still hadden received the item nor a tracking number I sent them an email asking for one and they replied that this item was backordered. The next day I checked back on Amazon and the seller still had it listed as in stock! I canceled my ordered and ended up buying it from Kaz, and I even got it a little bit cheaper."
4,"This air purifier works just fine, but is a bit too noisy to be used throughout the night in our bedroom. If they just had an extra lower setting, I think it would be fine for at night."
4,"After using it for just 2 hours in my bedroom, I started to noticed that the air I breathed in was clearer and I felt easier to breath! Only con is that it's super loud, even on the lowest setting. I leave it on during day when I'm at work and turn it off at night, so the noise doesn't bother me. I've used many small air purifiers before, but they didn't have the same effect as this large! I'm so glad that I decided to step it up with this larger unit."
4,"I ordered this product becuase I was informed by my doctor that I have severe allergies to dust, pollun, and pet dander. He stated that an air purifier may help, but it was not necessary. I went ahead and bought this product and immediately noticed a difference in the air quality of my home. Originally I had it in the living room, but it is too noisy for the TV even on the lowest setting. You have to turn the volume on the television up very loud to hear it. I now have it in the kitchen so that it is farther away from the TV and am happy with the purchase. The air is cleaner and even smells better!"
4,"dr. seuss was more than a children's book author, he was an artist. i had always taken for granted this fact until i saw this as another extension of his work. beautiful pictures and fascinating sculptures...would i love to one of those hanging in my livingroom!"
4,I owned this. Many years ago n i really did well with it not only is it fun but a great workout too
4,"william joyce's illustrations make this one of my very favorite books: it is the book i always give as a baby shower gift. ANYONE can give ""goodnight moon"" but this book is special. the first 5 or 6 times i read it to my son i cried at the last line. i like how the FATHER is the one who comforts the boy (on the last page) and it is the mother who looks on lovingly. simply a wonderful, cozy book, if ever there was one."
4,"This book in conjunction with the more ""technical"" Writing Arabic by T.F. Mitchell, is awesome for learning to write and read the ruq3a script used in Arabic handwriting. The reason I haven't given it the full 5 stars is that it doesn't have extensive handwriting examples for recognition practice, but if used in conjunction with Writing Arabic by T.F. Mitchell this is solved, as there is quite a few handwritten examples at the end of the latter. Writing Arabic by T.F. Mitchell is indeed very costly, $60, but shop around, I got mine almost new for $20."
4,This movie will keep you in suspense from the beginning to end. Once the haunting begins it's enough to keep you scared until it's over!
4,"If you like the sound of Dio, a little of Black Label Society or similar, but would rather the lyrics be driven by God's word and in a very powerful way, then this is for you! Outstanding guitar, outstanding vocals, outstanding production, and simply outstanding everything. Rob rock has a classic hard rock singing voice that is extraordinary. I have all of teh Rob Rock CDs and look forward to the next one."
4,I think that the book was very interesting. It has a lot of details that help you understand the book. I also like the ending.
4,"This book was our best resource for conducting our child care search. We found it the most pragmatic, methodical and comprehensive one on the subject. It contains charts, checklists, contracts...etc. needed by any parent who faces the (scary) process of searching for and maintaining quality childcare. We highly recommend it."
4,"These are a good fit and very comfortable. Make sure you check your shoe size with the s,m,l range carefully."
4,Especially good for wearing in a wall to wall carpeted home. Easy to clean - just throw them in the machine but don't dry them in your dryer. I love them.
4,"Great features on this unit include the easy lift off tank, replaceable water filter and soft cool mist.We use this in our daughters' room every day to offset the winter dryness produced by our forced hot air heating system. It has run flawlessly for over a year. It is very quiet, and runs a long time on the low output setting. If you turn the fan and humidity level to the maximum, it lasts approximately 12 hours in our house.We have had no water leakage problems, and no problem cleaning the base (as we do monthly). It DOES NOT leave water anywhere but in the air, where it is supposed to.Our kids get a kick out of the 'fog machine' in their bedroom.Why not 5 stars? Filters get expensive in the long run - $8 each and should be replaced often. We replace ours every 2 months or so."
4,"Lots of presented values in this film, with some predictable and cheesy parts. Overall, it's a very good buy, one your kids will love (lots of dogs of varying sizes)."
4,"I started this one but never had the chance to finish. And now, I have as with the rest of my books."
4,"Can't wait to visit china and take this with me,I hope I can make myself understood, maybe I'll just show them the book"
4,"I'm brazilian and I grew listening to Gilberto's songs. But this CD is a masterpiece. Even one that's not used to his style of singing will be delighted as well as the familiar listener. The best track, in my opinion, is ""Una Mujer"""
4,"Agile Project Management (APM) is a set of simple and flexible project management tools and methods which focus on the accurate capture of customer requirements and their translation into useful software features and functions...In APM customer requirements are listed in the form of an activity backlog which is broken down into scrum sprints...At the end of a scrum sprint, a discreet number of customer features and functions are designed, executed and approved by customers and other stakeholders...This agile project management approach reduces the cycle time necessary to create software, ensures it meets customer requirements and reduces its error rate. This book is very useful in that it clearly shows, using simple examples, how Agile Project Management and scrum methods are used in practice."
4,"Ha! People are allowed their own opinion i guess. I, personally, loved Paris Holiday. My 3rd year French class watched it today, and it was perfect. There was just enough French in it to make it extreamly interresting... Plus, the really cheezy story line and special effects really made it worth while.. It's just one of those old crummy flicks that you grow to love.. the bad guys after the good guys... the good guys winning it all in the end.... only to find out that they may not really have won.. Plus all the pretty girls. It's a great movie, if you like the type!!!! :D"
4,These are very comfortable it is very hard to find size 13 wide and extra wide in a store.Amazon was quick and easy will use more often this was my first time to use this site thanks!
4,I have bought 3 pairs of these shoes for work and walking around NYC! They last for a very long time and the support is vital in this concrete city! My personal fave!!
4,"I ordered this shoe after reading some good reviews on Amazon. I spend all day on my feet at work and so I wanted a comfortable shoe and this certainly is that. My only negative is that the tongue of the shoe is well made but is a bit stiff, so the break in period had to be supplemented with some padding to ameliorate some soreness where the shoe tongue was making contact with my upper ankle. Other than that I am happy with the shoe."
4,Good product. Fast shipping from the merchant and as always a good job by Amazon
4,"I have been wearing the Rockport Men's World Tour Classic Walking shoe for years--to work, around town, and on vacation. They are as comfortable as a shoe can be, look great in all situations, and last a long time. I have four pair and as long as Rockport keeps making them I will buy them. I've tried other brands but they just don't measure up to Rockport."
4,"I purchased these after wearing a similar style while on vacation about 18 months ago. Both pairs are very comfortable. They aren't what one would wear to ""dressy"" occasions, but the smooth finish on this pair makes it acceptable for most occasions."
4,"This is my fourth pair of these shoes over many years. Most comfortable every-day shoes I have owned in a long time. Okay for almost every occasion except formal. Price has actually come down since the last time I bought a pair. Good value. My only complaint is that the quality seems to have slipped half a notch, especially in the stitching of the uppers which has a tendency to pull loose a bit around the nose of the shoe. Wish they made these with a velcro flap instead of the laces."
4,"These are the only shoes my husband will wear. He says they are comfortable and they hold up well. When they get too scuffed up, he wears them for his everyday shoes and he buys another pair."
4,I purchased this shoe for my husband as a gift and he loves them. He raves about how comfortable and durable they are.
4,"I love Rockport shoes, and the price was great. I received the shoes on time, and exactly as ordered. Absolutely no complaints about this product."
4,"Most shoes have a distinct comfort lifespan, in the shape of a bell curve. They are uncomfortable for the first few days while you shape them, then are fine for a year or so, till they start to lose padding. But, not these!I just bought my second pair of this wonderful design, as my first pair was starting to lose tread after over three years. These shoes feel great from 15 minutes after you first put them on, forever(or at least 3 years).These shoes run a little bit larger than normal, and I find myself comfortable in a 10.0 instead of my usual 10.5."
4,I was able to quickly get my book and when I found out I no longer needed the book they were quick to refund my money.
4,"Not a noise concert like live in Brixton, this has actual songs and they're great. More energy than in the studio. If you like ATR, buy this."
4,"I bought this Oliver musical combo because my kids and I were rehearsing for the musical. The sound track does not cover all the key songs (1 I was suppose to sing), which was a bummer (Bill Sikes - Strong Men...). Other than that it was a good investment in a classic."
4,"I bought this for my kids. We sing the songs at bedtime (I was in a production as a child) and they really wanted to see it. They LOVE it! This package is awesome because you get both the movie and the CD in one. For this price, it's worth it even if you want just one or the other.Try this with your kids...next time they ask for more of anything, just say MOOOOOOORE!"
4,"WEAPONS OF CHOICE by John Birmingham is not a book with an original idea, but it is a well done, a well told story of modern war ships sent back do to an accident to WW II. The part that impressed me was the impact, the negative impact that these modern warriors have on everyone. It will be interesting to see how the next to books play out. I greatly enjoyed the read. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
4,"Birmingham's book is a very good read. I like the hard collision of cultures between the future folks and ""contemporaries"" or ""'temps"". The interesting point is made that the technology brought back in time may not be the issue driving the most change in the past world -- the mores and culture of the integrated futurists may be.Good characters, good plot, very entertaining."
4,"Finally got to read some over Christmas. I was a huge SF fan when younger and can honestly say not since the first Riverworld book ""too your scattered bodies go"" by Philip Jose Farmer has a book grabbed me and caused me to have to read every minute i had spare. I will not bore you with detailed reviews other than to say this is very well written, crisp, tight prose, great concepts, minute ideas and inventions thought of, right down to the brief yet shocking history of Pres Clinton. What can i say, if you like SF, AH, or a good action/war yarn this should appeal to all......i loved it."
4,"If you like a game that requires thought and imagination, you need to try the Planescape campaign. The world is an interesting blend of steampunk & magic. The handbook covers all you need more, but I still wish it could be longer despite being complete in and of itself. It's just so fun to leaf through and drool over the amazing cool work. I'm not really into most gaming because of the emphasis on combat a lot of games have, but this particular setting allows for a wide variety of roleplaying. Just be sure to find a GM with a good imagination!"
4,"This is a great ""cool age"" Jazz album. You could sit, dim the lights, push yourself back in a recliner (with or without a martini) and just groove . . . . Stan Getz is truly an icon of this style."
4,This fabulous record shows off the great artistry of a master musician on saxophone. Getz seems to have such a natural feel to this type of music. The guitar of Charlie Byrd is also superb and blends into the music in a wonderful manner. The other amazing aspect of this record is that I never tire of listening to it.
4,"Almost 40 years old, and still the standard by which all other Bossa Nova albums must be judged. It remains a delight to the ears no matter how many times it gets played, and is never far from my stereo. Truely one of the great jazz albums ever made. I hope you and Stan are jammin' now, Charlie."
4,Just a great CD to listen to when you want to relax and visit the places of yesteryear that are long gone but still preserved on CDs like this.
4,"If you're considering buying this book, note that it is satire. Although the book takes the form of an introductory text, as satire it is not suitable as a tutorial. Satire is educational and funny only if you already understand the satirized subject. Java is a big topic and a tough subject to satirize, and we have to admire Egremont for taking on the challenge. He is often insightful, and often funny. In many ways the book is too short, skipping many topics I would enjoy seeing roasted, like package protection and marker interfaces. On the other hand, the book's 128 pages taxed my indulgence for satire."
4,"Thinly disguised as humor, this book's pathetic attempt at breathing new life into the corpse we still know as Java is just more proof of the truly evil nature of the alien being known as MISTER BUNNY.What is good about a programming language? Hah...Foof!For example, like the idiot humans we are, we once thought pointers were cool! Now we think no pointers are cool!If you cannot understand how to understand this book, understand that BUNNY understands that JAVA (J.A.V.a., and I think you KNOW what I mean by ""_tHAT"") is only a lame construct devised by a bunch of polymorphic objects (humans) devised by a bunch of amorphous BLOBs developed by a bunch of BUNNYS(Binary Universal Nil-oriented Nonsenso-YakkonandonometerS), all of whom or which may or may not exist only in the imagination of the BEitSk (Big Engineer in the Sky).I give this book one star, but it is VERY ENORMOUS and also subject to numerary interpretation by your individual browser."
4,"I just received the cards, and I am very impressed with the quality of the reproduction of the artwork, as well as the stock and finish. Also, the information card is very informative, and adds to the card's overall appeal. I wanted a reproduction like this, and after reading the reviews on this one and the others available on Amazon, I decided on this one as it got the best reviews. I'm glad I did. Thanks!"
4,"This is what my 8 year old daughter says........This book is so awesome, I want to get all the books in the world about Pixie tricks!! I want my Mom to order them all!!so........ I am sending this because I looooooooooooove these books! I think Tracey West is the best author cause she also writes about Pokemon and that is my brothers favorite thing!"
4,"My mother gave my daughter this doll over a year ago when she was 2. It goes everywhere with us and has been washed several times and still looks good. It is light, pretty, doubles as a pillow, and small enough to stuff in the diaper bag."
4,"Picked up this SACD based on the many positive reviews here and I must agree. The album is highly repeatable without fatigue. If you enjoy relaxing music mixed with soft vocals, then take a chance and in a few weeks, you too will be writing the next review."
4,This was my first Macgregor series book and I really enjoyed this one!This is the story of two very different people who live across the hall from each other in a downtown New York city apartment building....She is a cartoonist and he is a play write and part time musician.....Their connection is vivid and well written....I loved when she follow him to the blues/jazz bar!! Funny and sad at parts and a very good ending....I would highly recommend this one even if you haven't read any other Macgregor series book before....this one stands on its own!!!
4,"Nora Roberts never disappoints me! I just loved this one. The Perfect Neighbor was a blast to read, I finished it in no time flat and read it again!"
4,If you are a fan of MST3000 you need to buy this video. very funny outtakes and behind the scenes kinda stuff. You'll be happy you did!
4,"MST3K's gag reel featuring episodes from seasons 2-6 isn't to be missed by any MSTie out there. The mess ups are also mess ups from everyone, for example, See Joel as he forgets his lines! See Trace (as Crow) lose Crow's arm and reach over to get it, see Tom Servo fall apart, see Mike as he ""virtually"" (you have to see it) messes up, and who can forget watching Frank crack up on the same line over and over and over and over again, I sure can't! The only flaw of this hilarous gag reel is that it is a half hour and I am sure there are more out there in seasons 2-6.However, overall it was a pretty good tape and worth any MSTie's money."
4,"If you're a Starz fan, you need to own this! It's a bit of an amateur production, but its many small flaws only add to the realism of it, and makes you feel like you're right there watching it live, warts and all.Michael Lee Smith forgets a couple of lines, but he's a great sport about it. These guys don't take themselves too seriously, and I can respect that. All the original members are here, with the exception of Peter Sweval, who passed away years ago. The replacement bassist however, does a great job, and oddly, he's the only one wearing a Starz shirt, and even more oddly, he seems to know the songs better than the rest of the band, who do a good job overall, but could have used another rehearsal or two.Video quality: Middling.Audio quality: Decent, but definitely not the gloss-job you'd expect from say, Pink Floyd. What you are hearing is real, with no overdubbing patched in later.It ain't perfect, but the overall show is MUCH better than the sum of its parts. TERRIFIC FUN!"
4,"Gosh, this is great looking - the atmosphere, the neon, the pompadours, the cast, the bikers, the Blasters, the retro cars. The music is first rate as well. Nobody dies, there is no bloodshed (except a bloody nose from fisticuffs).As another reviewer aptly put it, the story is straight out of Greek antiquity - and it merged with a midcentury comic book. The only trouble is the lines are delivered so lamely, which is hard to imagine, given the professional cast (Walter Hill never was good at commanding dialogue from his cast in any of his movies). Also - the retro look goes strangely 1980s when the cast ends up in what must've been an MTV version of Spanish Harlem. No matter. See this. It is a good testament to the power of storytelling."
4,"I like it! The acting is not great and the storyline is nowhere near deep...but the music is great and if you are in the right frame of mind, you'll find a lot of the dialogue hilarious. I'll definitely watch it again."
4,"This toy is awesome. we got it awile ago and it was Awesome. Its Awesomeness is so awesome it makes you want to say AWESOME! But, enough with the awesomes, Gigamesh may be the slowest, but he is the strongest. you don't have to do the missions with the spybots, you can do alot more! what I like to do is take off the sheets on my bed and then make them battle! It is also kind of cool that he has the spinning saws but I don't use that. And believe it or not when we play tag with three spybots, gigamesh is rarley it even though he has the weird, but unique cog system . SO, get Gigamesh! :) (smiley face)"
4,"Whether you're wondering about given names or surnames,place names or euphemisms--or just the ageold rivalry between British and American English and your love of the language they sometimes share--this is a must-have reference book for professional storytellers by one of the greatest wits in either tradition."
4,"I am a school teacher and I bought this movie to supplement a unit on imperialism, India's fight for freedom and the changes brought about by Ghandi. It was a great aid in meeting my frame works. I would highly recomend this movie."
4,"In this grand epic we are treated to an inside look at how a small man with great conviction and big ideas took on and defeated a superpower without ever lifting a gun. Mao was wrong, power does not come from the barrel of a gun, it comes from the handful of individuals who can see injustice and find a way to use its own strength to defeat it. Truth will win out if given it's way. Injustice will hang itself when given the rope. That is the legacy that Ghandi left us. In this superb portrayal by Ben Kingsley, Ghandi and his spirit are shared anew with those too young to have felt his impact.The movie is historically very accurate though there are a few events out of chronological order or disputed with regard to Ghandi's views. Still, overall, historical drama does not get much better than this."
4,"Even after roughly six decades of his death, Gandhi continues to influence and minds and hearts of people from all around the world. This movie is a fantastic description of the life of an ordinary man who rose to become one of the world's most influential people. He was neither a scientist, nor an artist, nor a man who can boast of any other extraordinary skill. Yet Gandhi achieved something which no person could manage to. He defied the empire on which 'the sun never set.' How did he manage to do this? The answer lies in the movie. Just watch it."
4,"There is nothing I can say about this movie that hasn't already been said by previous reviewers - beyond excellence -exceptGandhi said ""my life is my message"" - and the message of this film can change lives - not many films can make that claim!"
4,"Great product, the glue turns black once is dry,it doesn't hurt when you peel them out at all. My own lashes don't suffer when I use this. This is a really great affordable glue."
4,"I really loved this product. It is so much better than the other ones. Yay, I am so happy and satisfied."
4,"Duo white does NOT dry white. I dries translucent if you apply correctly. If you are using too much of the product, it will take very long to dry. FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS ON BOX IF YOU ARE A NEWBIE... Pros, we know this product is WELL WORTH IT!"
4,"The Spnogebob snowcone maker is a great toy. The snow cones are very fun to make and also taste very good. The Snow cones were delicious, tasty, and scrumdidlyumpscious. Overall this is a very good toy. I would recomed it to all."
4,"The other reviews are definitely correct--the cover is not white. It is more of a light tan. The company should change the photo to the correct color but it does seem to be made fine. We bought it for a pop-up & it seems to work like it should. I would still recommend it, regardless of the color."
4,"These Sunbeam pads only last 5 years or so, but I buy them anyway because they feel sooooo good. I just wish they lasted longer. The coils stop working one at a time until it is obvious you need to buy a new one."
4,"I love having a heated mattress pad on my new Cal king bed. I have had others in the past and really likethe Sunbeam one because my bed warms up quickly and has many more heating levels than the ones I previously had. I did find it a little strange to have a pre- heat option, but it really helps warm up the bed."
4,Works well. Still in use after two years. No issues. I would recomend this product to others as well. Warm
4,"Before you rush out to harrass your doctor for a Tamiflu script, sit down and get acquainted with the facts. This book can help you get your H5N1 ducks in a row. Dr. Marc Siegal cuts through the media-induced nonsense with a laser scalpel and excises only the facts for us. Fewer than a hundred people have died from Avian Flu since January 2004, yet more than 600 people die every single day from AIDS in Africa. Avain Flu is like ""Missing White Girl Syndrome"" for the rest of us (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_Pretty_Girl_Syndrome).In the US, more people have been shot by Dick Cheney than have contracted Avian Flu. Yes, we are all going to die, but not from H5N1. Thank you Dr. Siegal for standing up to Group Think, Herd Mentality, and thoughtless reactionism."
4,"A.D.D. & Romance is a ""Must Read"" if you have Attention Deficit Disorder and you are involved in a romantic relationship!This easy to read book is a ""gold mine"" of practical information that can be used by folks who have ADD as well as their partners to enrich their romantic relationship(s).Jonathan Scott Halverstadt, M.S. is up to date on the latest research and theory related to attention deficit disorder. He speaks ""from the heart"" and I guarantee you this book is just ""packed with information"" that will help you to understand your own romantic behavior and will give you lots of tips and strategies to make the most of your romantic relationship(s).I've read at least ten books on ADD and many of them were very helpful to me. However, A.D.D. & Romance by Jonathan Scott Halverstadt, M.S. is by far the best book I've read on the subject of ADD and romance."
4,"this is the best effort Lamb of God have ever recorded. Anyone who actually opens their ears will agree. The problem you people are having is you got hooked on their latter efforts first, then popped in New American Gospel and realized the riffs they are playing 8 years later have not changed one bit. So you don't like it because it sounds the same when in fact, New American Gospel came before all their other boring albums. Not to mention the fact that at least back then, they could do those songs with some speed and not just do 500 groove only riffs like they are channeling Funkadelic. The bottom line is this band pretty much sucks the royal backside, but if you are going to even give this band a chance you might as well start and end with this album, because the rest are so worthless it's not even funny."
4,"Tears for Fears is simply my favorite singers of all time. Their music really inspire me. Too bad that they aren't together anymore. ""Head Over Heels"" (which I am listening to right now)is my FaVoRiTe song. The lyrics, the music, the essence...ah--it gets no better. I cannot explain my feelings for this song in mere words. I Feeeeelllllll Soooo.......!!!!!!"
4,"I love this book and find myself referring back to it frequently to find pictures and information on important dogs and breeders in the AB world. I especially enjoyed the chapter on AB history as Mr. Putnam even-handedly presents several possible theories on the controversial origins of this breed, many of which I have not heard anywhere else. I also enjoyed reading about the author's first up close exposure to the sport of hog hunting. Get this book!"
4,"This book was recommended by my Physics advisor - to help me understand relativity. A short and all encompassing text, very well written and easy to understand."
4,"I am a huge Star Trek fan anyways, however Deep Space Nine engages more fully with any viewer's life and with society as a whole than any other ST series. ""Rejoined,"" ""Hard Time,"" ""The Visitor"" and many others in this season truly capture humanity at its best and worst."
4,"Starting with Way of the Warrior with its introduction of Worf and its large scale battle scenes, the series really takes off this season. The Visitor may be DS9's best episode and certainly its most heartfelt. It also contains the fun episodes Little Green Men, Our Man Bashir, and Bar Association; the suspenseful Homefront/Paradise Lost two-parter; the tragic love stories Crossfire, Rejoined and For the Cause; and many other strong episodes. Season Four also ses the introduction of series regulars Martok, Weyoun, and Joseph Sisko as well as the welcome return of many others (especially Tony Todd as Worf's brother Kurn). The Muse seems to be the weakest episode of the season, but its not nearly as bad as other season's weakest spots. Overall, not as strong as season six or seven, but Deep Space Nine was that rare show that got stronger each year and rewarded viewers who took the time to watch from the beginning."
4,"DS9 has turned out to be one of the more enjoyable series from the Star Trek franchise. Particularly enjoyed Way of the Warrior and Rules of Engagement, which is unique to the series in that the characters appear to be addressing the audience directly as they explain what happened during a firefight. And the Bar Association is funny in places... who would have guessed that Rom had the makings of a Marxist?It's been years and years since I've seen these shows and yet they still felt fresh when I watched them this week. Worth spending a few hours with."
4,"fantastic book! a great way for westerners to learn about tibetan medicine... Clifford enables the reader to connect an eastern tradition to our western minds... if you're interested in Tibetan medicine, this book is a great on to begin with..."
4,"Halberstam can perhaps be forgiven for focusing solely on the Yankees and Red Sox for the course of the book. The book is gripping, striking a fantastic balance between the games and the men who played them. If you're a fan of the baseball nostalgia genre, this is a must-read book."
4,Easy to download and easy to installed. Good good to read and very interested about Japanese Fair Tales. Good book to read to kill time when I'm traveling.
4,"I am a casual birder, and found this book to be very valuable in increasing my knowledge of birds and birding, not so much for the books content itself, but what it directs you to. It is full of web sites devoted to birds, and gives a review of each site so you don't waste your time going to a site you may not be interested in. It is a valuable resource, not only for beginners, but for the advanced birder as well. I highly recommend it."
4,I gave this product a review before. I am so happy and pleased with this television. I purchased it for my daughter and she is overwhelmed with it. She loves it. She is an adult and you know how hard it is to please your older children. Well she was taken by the television. I am pleased with the service that amazon always gives me. Amazon is great and mostly everything that I need I can look forward to getting it from amazon. You usually received these things within a timely manner and for that I am happy.
4,"Been using this for 2 years, hasn't failed me yet. Works perfect! Works so well I actually notice the small but subtle oil pressure difference (when car is fully warmed up) between old and new oil which tells me it's time for an oil change, go figure, when using conventional oil it always seems to be around 3k miles. On a warm day when car is hot and oil temp reads 180F (yes I got a sunpro oil temp gauge which is just as awesome), the new oil will idle right at 25 psi. Between 2k and 3k miles that pressure will slowly start to drop and at 3k miles on a warm day when car is hot (oil temp reads 180F) it will idle at about 20 psi. Not that either of those pressures are bad, just stating how accurate and precise this gauge really is."
4,"Excellent blues CD from an under publicized artist. I can't remember where I heard of this CD, but I'm glad that I did and glad that I bought it. It's been in my vehicle CD player since I got it about 3 weeks ago.If you like modern hill country blues in the style of RL Burnside, I think you'll like this CD."
4,"This TV is not too big, and definitely not too small. This TV is similar in price to countless 20"" TVs, with an added bonus of 3"" and twice the resolution! The picture and sound are great! I did a lot of searching for an LCD TV around 20"" for under $700.00 - this was the best value."
4,"Simple, subtle, brilliant and powerful (like e=mc^2), this book presents a domain model that encompasses all intra-enterprise and inter-enterprise relationships. How do you model a contract? How do you model ""purpose""? How do you model push and pull rights and responsibilities? How do you link these to the company's processes and entities? This book tells you how.Rather than presenting a UML model of how an enterprise functions this book presents a comprehensive UML metamodel based on a ""fractal"" DFD-like decomposition of organization, purpose, process and flows.The solution here is similar to the book ""Java Modeling in Color with UML"" use of domain-neutral component archetypes--only better if your goal is reusable code over several enterprises rather than a tuned one-off for a specific corporation."
4,"I am a huge fan of The Blair Witch Project. I've been following Ed and Dan (the 2 creators) for the last few years and i'm very pleased they are releasing movies again. Ed's 2006 ""Altered"" was creepy no doubt, but a bit too gory for my tastes. Dan's movie, Believers, is much more minimal. The storyline is kinda refreshing in the sense that the movie doesn't actually revolve around some kinf of ghost or monster. The acting is decent, but the footage quality is rather murkey. All in all this is probably the best straight-to-DVD horror movie i've seen all year. The ending is rather impressive too."
4,We had another mattress pad that never really got the bed warm no matter how long you turned it on before going to bed. This one really heats up the bed and you have to basically turn it off when you get in bed or you will overheat.
4,This item was one of those once in a lifetime absolutely perfect purchases. I am queen every cold winter night when I get in bed and my husband has turned my side of the bed on so Im cozy warm right away! No more thrashing around in the middle of the night because blankets have become too heavy or falling off the bed. No folded blankets at bottom of bed for me to pull up when I can't get warm enough to sleep....I can't believe it took soooo long to find a product like this.
4,"I bought this for my 83 year old father who chooses to live on oatmeal, peanut butter and crackers, coffee, chocolate and ensure. He was happy."
4,"This toy isn't made the best. It doesn't fold up into a sturdy toolbox like it is supposed to, but it is still around and played with a once or twice a week by both of my boys (5 and 2 1/2 years) three years after santa delivered it!!"
4,"Originally started reading this book from our local library and quit because it seemed too technical to enjoy, but on second attempt found it educational and filled with personal stories that made it fun to read. I enjoyed it so much that I bought it.If you're willing to invest a little time learning the habits of fish and traits of small and large waters, it's an invaluable resource book and humorous at the same time."
4,"Without a big band behind him Young blows his soft and simple yet powerful melodies with understated brilliance and to astonishing effect.Recorded in the early 1950s in New York the album encapsulates a subtler and gentler side of Manhattan's Swing Street era. Young and Peterson slow down large stretches of the CD and produce cut after cut that are beyond cool.Lester Young with the Oscar Peterson Trio is indispensable and one of the greatest jazz albums ever created. Fellow sax legend Art Pepper once had a few critical words about Stan Getz, saying that a lot of Getz's playing was copied, and that much of that copying was done off of Lester Young's exquisite homework."
4,Is definitely worth reading. Spicy yet also romantic. Has a good mixture of different aspects of erotica but a good story as well. I love reading Emma Holly stories. The characters are so real; I want to find out what happens after the book ends. Thanks Emma - this one's a keeper!
4,"I purchased this for $7.40 for my husband and had it shipped to his office. The candy was a big hit with he and his coworkers! That being said, I would never pay full price as there's not a whole lot in the box. If you can grab this when it's <$10 and get free shipping I say go for it! :)"
4,"If you enjoyed the original Predator, you'll love this film. I personally prefer it to the first one. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the original but, this sequel is better. Danny Glover does a nice job as usual. Gary Busey pulls off the obsessed military man and the Predator is awesome. The DVD doesn't have too many extras but, that's to be expected with an older movie. I have to admit it would be nice to have a special edition of this movie. If you like action and alien creatures, you'll dig this movie."
4,"This movie is a rarity as a sequel because in my opinion it surpasses it's predecessor. Danny Glover plays ""Action Man Super Cop"" who is on the hunt for someone or something who is killing all of the Drug Lords in 1997 L.A. I haven't as yet figured out why this is a bad thing but Hey what do I know? This movie is redeemed and enhanced by the presence of the beautiful Maria Conchita Alonso who has a very unique way of introducing herself to her new partner.!!! Watch this movie and you will see what I mean!!~"
4,"This book is a compilation of two seperate works: ""The March of the Barbarians"" and ""Tamerlane,"" detailing the lives and conquests of these great warriors and their descendants.This was the first detailed history of this subject that I ever read, is still the most readable, and has been a treasured companian since its publication in 1953, starting a personal library that now contains a good many books on related subjects, including Lamb's works on Cyrus, Babar, and Charlemagne.""The Earth Shakers"" is a fine introduction to a fascinating period in Asian history, an epic sadly downgraded in Western consciousness."
4,I first learned about this book from Essence Magazines best sellers list. I read a brief synopsis and decided to purchase the book because it seemed interesting and Essence is rarely wrong. This book was amazing. Its a bit hard to get into at first but I loved it. It was beautifully written. Kudos!
4,"Night Train is truley one of the most swinging, hippest, and greatest jazz albums I've ever heard. The band plays so tight together that if you put a piece of coal on the bandstand, you would get a diamond. Buy this album! It is a ""must have."" Warning: You may have to wear a seatbelt while listening to it, because you'll definitely be up and dancing if you're not strapped down. Enjoy!!!!!!!"
4,"This book is clear, non-technical, and easy to read and understand. People interested in the subject will find it useful."
4,"They don't come much better than Ben Webster and Oscar Peterson. And this CD demonstrates why.From Webster's opening on ""The Touch of Your Lips"" to the final notes of ""This Can't Be Love"", these two great artists combined to create one of the best albums in jazz history. Its impossible to listen to this and not find yourself getting carried away. The highlight of the album, though, is Webster's rendition of ""In The Wee Small Hours of the Morning"". As the liner notes state, its not surprising that Webster captures this Sinatra classic perfectly given the fact that he'd probably listened to it hundreds of times before this recording was made. All the same, the lush, lyrical, tone he achieves is simply awesome, and it lead me to wonder what a duet between Ben and Frank might've sounded like.......Not only do you need to buy this album right now, when you get it you need to play it as loud as possible with all the windows open. Everyone in the world deserves to hear this one."
4,"When your lover has gone is NOT taken too slow--it's tempo is flawless, just like the rest of the album. In fact, I still get goosebumps when I hear Old Ben's mournful cry pierce the quiet of the evening on that gem (this CD is ideal for nocturnal listening, whether you're nursing a drink or romancing that special someone). Jazz should not be judged by the tempo at which it is played. After three or more decades in the business, these guys knew at what tempo to play a song."
4,"After a heartrending death of all she believes in, the heroine is visited by the spirits of the land and by her late husband's father, to seek out and keep the magic alive by travelling afoot through the realms and bringing out the best in others. Her journey is filled with self-discovery and realizes the inner landscape of all she crosses, although not too late to save herself"
4,"i'll keep this short and sweet as most of the previous reviews point out the obvious.this is unquestionably the uncensored version.back in the early ninties i obtained a vhs copy of this movie titled'zombie flesh eaters-strong uncut version',it wasn't the greatest of quality so i purchased numerous uk versions and found that they were heavily censored.so now that i've made my comparisons with that tape i can gladly announce this deluxe version from anchor bay is the shizzle and a snip at 12 usd!!"
4,"""Zombi 2"" is the same film as Zombie. That much we've figured out. There's also a ""Zombi 3"" and a ""Zombi 4."" What some reviewers have asked is where is the missing chapter? So here goes.When George Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" was released in Italy, it was released under the name ""Zombi."" ""Zombi 2"" was written before Dawn, but was slightly changed to cash in on Romero's success. Thus, rather than call it ""Zombi"" again, they stuck on a ""2,"" making it seem like a sequel.When ""Zombi 2"" was released in the U.S., the name was changed once again, this time to ""Zombie.""And the confusion ends."
4,"The Blue Underground DVD is the most beautiful transfer I have seen. It is colorful and clear. I have seen many muddy, fuzzy, colorless versions of this film. This one is great. Be sure to get the Blue Underground DVD if you want to buy this f ilm (and you should if you like zombies)."
4,Just a cheap rip off of Dawn of the Dead. But so what its still pretty cool anyway. The story is set on a tropical island where voodoism raises the dead back to life. But i must say the script and acting were not great. Definitely not as cool as the masterpice The Beyond was(which i give 5 stars) but still pretty good italian flick. AWESOME GORE FULCI LIVES
4,"I have this movie! It is a heartwarming story the family will ever love! They are a lot of puppies, a lot of love and attention for them. They found Pilot under the table. When the kids dad (Robert Hays)was on his first day to work, The dog was in the house. The kids wanted to keep him. Their mom said,""Yes!""The kids were excited! Now it's your turn to watch it then type about it! And if you like The Retrievers, you'll love Miracle Dogs. Micacle Dogs is about a Springer spanlel that had puppies. I don't have Miracle Dogs yet but I might!"
4,"""Walden Pond: A History"" is a wonderful, in-depth guide that provides a wealth a background on the pond and its inspiration on our literature and culture. I found the book to be a fantastic - behing the scenes - guide to not only Thoreau's classic ""Walden,"" but the musings of Emerson and Alcott as well. I have been going to Walden every summer for years (I live close by). This book has greatly enhanced my experiences while visiting the pond, and reinvigorated my interest in its history in general."
4,"Probably one of the best books I've ever read. Well-paced, beautifully written and sad as all heck. Lots of good Afrikaans; I can imagine that aspect might be a struggle for some. I believe this book to be superior to 'Cry the Beloved Country', which is saying a lot."
4,omg this is the sadess movies...i cry every time i see it but its the best movie ever! if u havnt seen this movie u really need 2
4,"My wife and I went to see ""Ladder 49"" expecting another ""Backdraft"". ""Ladder 49"" makes that movie look like a cartoon. Most things rang true. When Phoenix's character fights his first fire it was just like what all firefighters experience. As a firefighter I noticed a few technical errors but I'm sure they happened to make the movie flow a little easier. Nothing major, like where they parked one of the engines was bit too close to the fire, and I was taught to never give your breathing apparatus to a victim (they may fight you to keep it). But, basically it was very entertaining and most of it, like I said, had the ring of truth."
4,"I grew up in a neighborhood of rowhouses on the edges of Baltimore City. My father spent some 30 years with the Baltimore City Fire Department, and the single word I can use to describe this film is ""authentic."" I remember watching my father come home in that same blue work shirt with its black and gold patch proclaiming ""Pride Protecting People."" I remember going into the Engine House with him as a kid, tossing a football or a softball around with the guys and dreading the fact that any moment that bell could ring, that the dinners on the plates in the kitchen could go uneaten, that the baseball gloves could be dropped and the turnout boots thrust on.This film places the emphasis on why these men party as hard as they do - because every beer might be the last one, and it might as well be the best one."
4,I enjoyed the movie and wanted to add a CD copy to my collection of video. The price was reasonable.
4,"A young firefighter becomes a seasoned pro, has a family and witnesses fellow firemen die in the line of duty, until he becomes trapped in a burning building.The CGI in this movie are excessive and not always realistic looking. The story is okay, nothing special but it is pretty much what you'd expect. This movie was obviously made to cash in on the hero worship towards firefighters that swept the nation after 9/11. Hey, that's Hollywood, right?I'd recommend it."
4,if your into firefighting im sure youve already seen it if you dont own it there are some cool extra about firefighting. and if not but just into movies if you liked the guardian or backdraft youll like it too.
4,"Excellent book. The authors captured very well the drama and adventure of the initial exploration. It is magical to read about how the cave revealed itself to the world.There is also a description of the politics and struggles to control the expeditions, but this is done in a measured way that doesn't distract from the main story.The only bit that I found lacking is the amount and quality of the maps. Although admittedly probably no amount would have been enough."
4,I have enjoyed the entire Mitford Years series. I received this book exactly as promised. I would buy anything Jan Karon writes from this seller
4,I wear hats all of the time. This one fits pretty good. I really like the way it looks and it is pretty durable.
4,My husband has a time finding a hat big enough & this one was perfect! fits great & looks great!
4,"I got this to replace my work cap, just so I can have more than one. It fits very comfortable on the head and the bill sits in the perfect spot, not too high and not too low. Easy to reshape it, I like it slightly more bent than flat. Also the color contrast of the black and stone one looks really good, nice how under the bill there's gray while the rest of it is a very slightly faded black. There's only one thing that I didn't like, it's that the part where the corners of the bill meets the hat itself aren't smoothly attached. Looking at the picture you wouldn't notice unless someone points it out, you can see the part on the bill how the cotton sticks out just a little bit over the bill."
4,"Product was pretty much like I expected......very lightweight bag that folds into a small package. I had planned to use it in case I bought too many souvenirs on a recent trip to Peru. Instead I ended up using it instead of my sturdy backpack to hold all my gear on a four day trek, since the duffle was easier to pack on the horse. So, I used the duffle for heavy duty use, and it held up extremely well."
4,"This is a wonderful book that assumes the reader does not want to be condescended to an told what to do, it rather presents the facts along with the the author's opinion in a way which lets the reader draw their own conclusions. Everything is backed up by data, including excerpts of studies in the back of the book.This is an excellent book for the woman who wants to know 'why?', not just what the experts opinion is. Henci doesn't just give you her opinion, she is very clear on why she came to that conclusion. In contrast, many authors tell the reader what is essentially opinion dressed up as fact.I highly recommend this book."
4,"So much of our birth experiences result from the choices we make both before and during labor. This book teaches us how to understand the decisions that need to be made and how to navigate the confusion of the obstetrical world. I am a Licensed Midwife and owner of Carolina WaterBirth, a birth center in SC. I often recommend this book to women looking for answers, and we refer to it in childbirth classes. In labor, I can truly see more confidence in the women who have given thoughtful consideration to their birthing desires. You'll be grateful that you read this book."
4,"This documentary explains in short, the history of the Jewish people and how Anti-Semietism first started..it is brilliantly done. The interviews portraid are opinionated from both sides, from the Catholic church to Jewish professors of history to Arab media spokespeople to Professors and teachers of English/History in Egypt. In short it is portraid slightly in favor of the Jewish, but still has a great view of opposition from Europeans and Arabs. What really makes the documentary is the Narrorator, his name is Gene Galusha (best known as Narrorator for Discovery Channel's ""New Detectives"") Gene does an outstanding job and really brings this documentary an intriguing cohesiveness. Great job Gene! Your name needs to be on documentary description as to who the Narrorator is.."
4,"As film actress Georgia Lorrison, Lana Turner gives one of her best performances and Kirk Douglas is great as the cad, Jonathan Shields. This film won an amazing total of 6 AA; only the odd-mouthed Gloria Grahame (in a frivolous performance) won for an acting role. The paradoxical, corrupt and colourful world of Hollywood is given pretty honest treatment here and it's a fascinating excursion into what made the film capital tick back in the early 50's. Lana Turner surprised many when she showed just how far she could stretch her acting ability when well-directed. Cynical and hard with elements still revelent today, THE BAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL gives us an insightful look into the lives of users and abusers and it's most interesting to watch, for those in the mood."
4,"The true skin of Hollywood studio system is finally shows itself through Vincente Minnelli's crime/Noir; The bad and the beautiful. Slightly hits the simular angle to Billy Wilders acclaimed Sunset Boulevard which was released 1950, three years prior to The bad and the beautiful.However Minnelli offers us an inside narrative from three characters who each play a major part in the film industry, Actress, Director and writer who all have been betrayed by the callous Hollywood mogul, Jonathan Shields. Douglas obviously knew his part, and portrayed it well, along with the support of a great supporting cast.Like Sunset Boulevard the film did receive mixed reviews, not to mention the reaction of such audiences like Louis B Mayer.I highly recommend this to anyone who appreciates classics or has always been interested on the history of Hollywoods studio system of the golden era."
4,"Yes, all prior reviews are true and the historical contextis accurate. Bossa Nova was revolutionary and Jobim a geniusand I hope he is inducted into the Downbeat Jazz Hall of Fame soon, as one of the most brilliant of all composers of the 20th century. This CD is essential for all of us who love Bossa Nova and know it well. A word of caution, however, for our younger music lovers. Do not mischaracterize Bossa Nova based on this CD. This orchestratral approach became the basis for much/all of Muzak. And like so much of radical brilliance, became cliche'd. Every businessman who has travelled has also heard these arrangements in Holiday Inn bars all over the US, listen to ""Girl from Ipanema"" and mourn the passage of time. Some of the beautiful flute ""improvisations"", actually simple harmonies, are the basis for some of the most bland smooth so-called jazz today. Make sure you also explore CDs that are as impactful in simplicity today as in the 60s, so far truly timeless...An updated context."
4,I like mustard and this is a good product at a good price and easy to dispense. You've gotta love the upside-down containers that dispense right away.
4,"Annie Wilson is a singlehusband mother of 3. She makes a living as a fortune teller. She is being harassed by a clients jealous and is being haunted by visions of a missing firl who is thought to be dead. She is pulled into a web of lies and deceit that will put her very life in danger.This movie is very good. It has a great cast, a pretty original story, and lots of twists and turns. The story is very interesting and will surprise you in the end. The atmosphere created gives it a very gothic mood. It's definitely a dark tale. If you haven't seen The Gift then you are missing out. I hope you enjoy it."
4,"As a teacher in a rural high school with a student population that is over 98% Latino most years and the author of a mystery series featuring a Latino private investigator, I have always been most impressed by Rudolfo Anaya, his work, and particularly his BLESS ME ULTIMA. Anaya is an amazing writer. His prose is beautiful. His story is fascinating, telling the tale of a Latino boy growing up in the American Southwest over a half-century ago. BLESS ME ULTIMA survives the test of time, and it speaks to the youth of today--not just Latino youth in the Southwest. Its reach is universal, and BLESS ME ULTIMA is Anaya's masterwork."
4,"How can an author do better than ""The Little Prince""? He can't. And once the dull reader--myself--accepts that, Saint-Exupery's other wonderful books become what they are meant to be: special gifts from a memorable writer.Read ""Flight to Arras"" to learn about the nature of warfare, the nature of defeat and, in the midst of all this overwhelming distress, the importance of the individual."
4,I was taking swim classes and was tired of carrying a big bulky towel around. My friend had one of these and I was just amazed when I saw her using it. I just had to get one. So I did. I stopped going to swim class but I didn't stop using my little sports towel.
4,My husband was very pleased with this gift to replace the chamois he has used for several years. It absorbs water quickly. It stays fresh when rinsed regularly.
4,WOW!!! The ending was not as I expected. During my reading of this book I was thinking that it was so obvious who was behind the killings...but I was wrong. I was very shocked to say the least. The book from the very beginning was interesting. I could not get anything else done for wanting to read this. I would take it to work with me and read on breaks and lunchtime. The author is without a doubt my favorite. Everything I have read by her has been interesting from page 1. Indulge yourself today in the works of Christiane Heggan.
4,"There is one problem, packing before Cd was striped. But the songs are very beautiful. I recommend it highly."
4,"I've been a long-time industrial/techno/trance fan and have grown up listening to Front 242, Frontline Assembly, NIN, Skinny Puppy, etc... one day a friend of mine popped a CD in and it was some of the best music I've ever heard.. when he told me it was a Christian band I was totally blown away.. it doesn't really matter what they are the music is very, very good. Very danceable and great lyrics either way.. (and no, I'm not religious) ..Bottom line is get this CD no matter what you like - you won't be disappointed!"
4,"This thing comes separated and you have to put it together and then try to take it apart. I put it together in like two minutes. I still, after maybe a year still have not gotten it apart. But, I will keeping trying..."
4,"This is a great recording from truly good musicians. The selection of songs is fantastic. Among the best are South rampart street parade and Sweet Georgia Brown. If you like traditional music,you will love this recording."
4,This is a truly beautiful addition to my Christmas music collection. Can't wait to listen to it every day with the holidays approaching.
4,"I've only had the opportunity to see Mr. Earl perform one time . It was 3:00 am at the old Tips in New Orleans. There were about 20 of us in the room and Earl was playing old T-Bone licks like it was the most important guitar being played anywhere in the world that night.But nothing prepared me for his 'ROUND MIDNIGHT on this record. There is no need to compare it to the great Miles and Coltrane version or any of Monk's wonderful solo recordings but for guitar players he has simply NAILED THIS GREAT SONG AT IT'S MOST SOULFUL HEART and fills the room with beauty.There are musicians that play their instruments and those that seemingly become theirs. Choose your big city -close your eyes - and put on 'ROUND MIDNIGHT. Mr. Earl - thank you sir , David Moore"
4,"Round Midnight is great different version of the classic by T. Monk. I give it a 5 out of 5. Overall, the album is very good."
4,These fools are the coolest! They rock the party and trip like I do. JD shake what ya mama gave ya! These guys really know how to jam and encourage others with their musac! Keep rockin' for tha Lord homies! PEACE Coolio
4,"Of course I thought I really loved my child before I got this book but I have to admit that I wasn't getting the message through to her. Now I understand that I need to really take more time to communicate with her, listen to her point of view and give her my undivided attention. I think Campbell's message is worth putting into practice. I highly recommend this book for any parent."
4,"My son (11) asked for this for Christmas. It is an awesome toy. Great mind bender with no batteries. My husband liked it so much we had to get him his own. He wouldn't let our son have it. This is a portable toy which will keep you amused in any waiting situation: line at the grocery, doctor's office, sibling's sports event. Well made and worth every penny. The numbers do take some sliding to get to a point where you have smooth and easy movement. It should last a lifetime."
4,"I've copied two VHSs of operas that I wanted to back up. Unfortunately the English subtitles have got lost in the process. Sadness since my German and Italian are minimal.No one has mentioned that it plays DVD-ROMs. If you copy a DVD in your PC using Nero Recode, some DVD-RW drives - like my two, a Philips and an LG - enable the book style of a DVD+R/RW (including DL) blanks to be changed to this. Very handy.Still a shame about those lost subtitles"
4,Pickle Things was the first book I learned to read before I entered Kindergarten. I loved it then and I love it now. The quirky humor makes my boys bust into giggles. Who would wear pickle shoes? Definitely a great book to have in your collection and it was in awesome condition from the seller.
4,"This CD just proves that girls can do it. Kittie totally blows out most of the heavy metal bands these days. It's the best CD, i'm so not disappointed with it. Go out and buy it ASAP if you are just thinking about getting it. Kittie is amazing."
4,"Kittie! WHOOO Best band in the world! This was their first CD and probably their best! I can't get enough of it! Brackish, Trippin & Spit are my fave songs on that album, but they are all great! Metal fans.. pick this one up if you haven't already!"
4,"This i have to admit is a fairly good metal CD. I wasn't blown away from Charrlotte. Which is there MTV single. But my friend wanted to get this burned. So i burned it for myself, and it was good. This 2 songs weren't that great, but when i heard ""suck"" and ""brackish"", i was hooked. This CD is very catchy and awesome. I suggest you get it."
4,Very good game. Easy to learn. Recommend this game to all the star trek lovers out there
4,"I bought these for a complete overhaul of my 1993 Toyota Camry's sound system. After 3 years of abuse, the sound is still crystal clear! 3 years of blasting music, sitting in summer heat (I don't get to park in the garage :( ), braving winter's cold and the speakers are just as strong as when I bought them. In fact, these speakers are so strong I've had to pull apart the door twice to find rattles that they have created! Granted, I prefer my music loud and some of it has quite a bit of bass, so this may not be a problem for you. The speakers carry excellent sound throughout the volume range, however the treble can be overpowering at high volumes. A simple change on the equalizer of your system can correct this, and it doesn't occur in every song. The only thing I wish I had done differently was buy these from Amazon, not Crutchfield (Amazon has them for half the price I paid...). Buy them, your ears will thank you."
4,"An excellent read for any parent, or anyone who works with children in any capacity. It is very clear and concise in the way it outlines what to look for in children who are at high rish for serious problemes down the road, whether they are mental problems, or behavioral problems leading to incarceration. I read parts of this book over repeatedly, as I work with children mental with problems and have also experienced these problems in my own family. Easy for a lay person, or non professional, to read and understand."
4,Just loved reading all 4 of the books - great easy reading. I can't put a Nora Roberts book down once I have started reading.
4,I have read all of the original left behind series. I love the way that the authors can combine fiction with endtime biblical prophecy. The Young Trib Force is a great way to see what it will be like when the rapture takes place. I also like the fact that it gives each teen's perspective. I would recommend this book to my friends.
4,"My daughters 2.5 and 4 love this game. It is very easy to understand and turns go quickly. Because the instructions are so simple they can play by themselves with out me having to play referee. Although, I can see how after awhile it will become boring, but for now they love to see who will open the treasure! It's a great ""very first game"". With a little creativity, you can make the game last much longer! ;-)"
4,"I am a pediatric Speech-Language Pathologist for a Children's hospital in Virginia. My kids LOVE this game. It's durable and fun for all. It helps them to match and name colors, shapes, numbers and simple letters. It also allows me to help them with turn-taking and other pragmatic language skills. I highly recommend this for any early language population and preschoolers, but my own teenager loved to try it out as well!!"
4,This game is great as a therapy tool. As a speech therapist I use it for my kids who need practice with articulation or increase in expressive vocabulary. Very durable and adaptable with your own pictures.
4,"This is a fun game that is contained in the box--just lift the lid--much easier to set up than most board games. However, this game only covers the first three letters of the alphabet, the three primary colors, numbers 1, 2 and 3 and three basic shapes. If your child already knows these concepts well, they will get bored with this game as soon as the novelty of the game's design wears off. Expect the small balls, tiny cards and plastic key piece to get lost. It's an expensive game because of its innovative design, so ask for it as a gift.Note to the game designers: at this price (comparable to software games), you should include at least three sets for the ""doors"" so that the game can grow with the child's knowledge."
4,"A lesser known work of Fred Astaire, Anthony Perkins, Ava Gardner and Gregory Peck, but one that is well presented and underscores the fears associated with the Cold War / Nuclear Holocaust era. It provides hope (even in the midst of futility) that ""man"" will strive to survive and love will prevail. A great addition to any library."
4,"hilt, Journey to the Center of the Bowl (Nettwerk, 1991)How to describe the brilliance that is Journey to the Center of the Bowl? It retains the incredible diversity of hilt's debut album, Call the Ambulance... Before I Hurt Myself, while still sounding like a more coherent piece of work. Al Nelson is more in tune, and doing more of the lounge-lizard vocal thing. After almost fifteen years, I have yet to decide whether that's a good or a bad thing. The lyrics are almost as inspired here as they are on the first disc, and Nelson has more of a sense of cleverness, rather than all-out insanity, throwing in little surprises (""Birdwatcher"" is especially fetching) and reversals throughout the lyrics. The band sounds not much different, if you strip away the genre-bouncing; it's still excellent, solid performance.This, folks, is what pop music could have been for the last fifteen years. Listen, and weep for what it has become. ****"
4,"If you are a fan of the other episodes in this series, you will love this DVD.The acting is superb, the storyline is very well-written and the animals are some of the cutest I've ever seen. This is one of the few series that I've seen where the cast fit perfectly together as if they had been together their entire lives. When you are watching, you are drawn into their different personalities.This is a series with heartwarming stories and unexpected twists. Whether you are a longtime fan or a beginner, you will enjoy this DVD. Definitely worth watching."
4,These linking rings are awesome and they work just like I have seen other magicians perform. They do come with instructions and are well made out of steel or something. I was able to perform within minutes and amazed my family.
4,I own tons of perfumes but this is the only one i would use daily! My nose is very sensitive but this scent is very light. Love it!
4,I used it in a steam cleaner and it worked pretty good. Had to go over the carpet area 2X though.
4,Works on removing odor and stains. Highly recommended! Worth every penny. Glad there is such a product for removing pet odors and urine stains.
4,"Spontaneously had more to say after his ""First Wish"", and specifies the ambient he is thinking of: at midnight, quietness and warmness to sense with the loved person..."
4,"This tool rack has made my garage much more manageable. I've got a weed whacker, 3 rakes, 4 shovels, pick axe, axe, 2 snow shovels, pitch fork, post hole digger and more stored on this thing and it is great. The wheels let me swing it across the garage or onto the driveway so I can have several tools close at hand without trying to juggle carrying them. It looks nice and does what it's supposed to do. Definitely recommend this in your garage."
4,"Very good quality and was able to fit a substantial amount of tools in it. Organized my outside shed quite nicely. Also, with the larger bottom shelf, it is very stable."
4,The Rubbermaid Tool Tower is so simple to assemble. It is relatively sturdy as long as you appropriately balance your tools along the rack. I have stored it in my tool shed. The feature I love most is the cart's mobility because it is on caster wheels. It is reasonably priced for such a great product. A real problem solver if space is an issue for you. I highly recommend the Tool Tower
4,This is just what I was looking for. It freed up a bunch of space for me. It is a little more flimsy than I thought but it's really not bad. I recommend it.
4,This is a great product. It was easy to put together and is very sturdy. I am using it to help clean up the clutter in my garage.
4,"Great product - really reduces the clutter of all my yard tools etc... and saves a lot of space. I have 11-12 foot ceilings in my garage so it is easy to get things in and out. If you have lower ceilings, you may have to wheel it out of the garage first to get items in and out."
4,My wife and I really enjoyed this movie and was really impressed by how good the special effects were for a low budget film. The acting was good too and of course the story is outstanding.
4,"johnny smith and hank jones made about a half dozen albums together. this one is under hank jones's name, and it is just as great as any of the ones under johnny smith's name. i could have done without outtakes, but they did what they could with what they had. if you are a fan of either, you should enjoy this."
4,"Since I had read a couple of other books by the author, I expected to laugh out loud a little and chuckle a lot, but I didn't expect to learn so much about America as I did. This is a very enjoyable book. You can't have thick skin if you read it though. Bryson is pretty critical of some of the places he visits."
4,"Have been reading this ""type"" of work for many years.Once thought Mr. Bryson funny. Now, I find him mean in spirit toward anything in the USA. Note that he has decided to live in great BritainAlso, have realized his works are somewhat derivative,Please read Jean Shephard...as in Wanda Hickey's Night of Golden Memories. And others.Jean has no mean streak, as does Mr. Bryson. I have just come to realize this. And feel sorrow that I once enjoyed Mr. Bryson....."
4,"Thematic and organizational similarities to Steinbeck's Travels With Charley and William Least Heat Moon's Blue Highways are obvious, but Bryson takes The Lost Continent into territory scarcely traveled by Steinbeck and Least Heat Moon. You see, Bryson laces humor liberally throughout his travel memoirs. The other writers' travelogues about adventures and people encountered on American roadways had less humor. That's not to say that Bryson's book surpasses those of the great, earlier writers in this genre; Bryson's approach is merely true to Bryson's chuckle-packed narrative style. Therefore, since I find Bryson's humor and storytelling so irresistible, I feel this book is a great read."
4,"This book is a gem, which I found after enjoying Bryson's A Walk in the Woods. His humor is indeed often sophomoric, but he spreads it around evenly on himself as well as others, and taken in the right spirit, he is truly funny. Mostly I enjoyed reading along with a U.S. map in hand, learning about towns and sites I may never visit. I wish he would travel the U.S. again and write an updated version. I would love to read it!"
4,"I brought this CD through Amazon.com before it was released in New Zealand. I had downloaded some songs and I loved them, so wasn't going to wait a month for it to come out, even though it would have been about $25 cheaper. Her voice is amazing, and the mixture of instruments work really well. Every one of their songs has the potential to be as big as ""BRing me to Life"". Excellent CD. The only downside is that they didn't include ""Forgive me"" in their CD."
4,"Hard to put words into a review for this band. As a previous review had said, it's like Sarah M. meets Linkin Park. But..who gives a damn? This is great music, ESPECIALLY for a band with a female vocalist.(No, i'm NOT sexist!) But seriously, this band and album are hard to put into words. If you like any of the following bands: Nine Inch Nails, Linkin Park, or even Sarah M., you will LOVE this band. This album is classified as many things, Rock, Techno, and even Gothic Industrial. What do I think? Heck, It's all of them rolled into one big mega package. A perfect description of this band is as thus: ""A female version of Nine Inch Nails(and maybe Linkin Park), only with rock, no cussing, and a female singer"" 3 Best songs on the album? ""Going under"" ""Bring me to life"" and ""Hello"" Nuff said, this band RULES! Go buy the album ""Fallen"", you will NOT be dissapointed at all!"
4,"evanesence is a talented band, ben moody with his amazing guitar skills and amy lee with her beautiful singing, songwriting and piano skills is a perfect collaboration and I look forward to hearing more from evanesence, especially more musical diversity"
4,This album has been my favorite for a long time. Every song is catchy and has a nice gothic metal feel to it with very deep lyrics. I love this band so much!
4,I bought this cd when it first came out. I still not tired of it. it is so awesome Evanescence is one of the best bands ever and i hope they come out with more stuff.
4,"As with most others, I first heard Evanescence with the hit single ""Bring me to Life"". Surprisingly, given the amount of airplay this song has received of late, this is actually not one of the standout tracks on the band's debut album ""Fallen"" - songs such as ""Taking over me"", the second single ""Going Under"", and the beautiful ""My Immortal"" are far more memorable. While there is no disputing Evanescence's talent, they still have a long way to go before topping European rockers Lacuna Coil, who sound similar and yet seem to have that little bit extra skill, variety and depth in their albums."
4,"Okay, just because I like Evanescence doesn't mean I'm a teenie-bopper who listens to Good Charlotte and thinks they're punk. I don't watch MTV and listen to the pop and rap they have on there. I listen to different types of rock, including System of a Down, Green Day, Metallica, P.O.D, Drowning Pool, and Hoobastank. This CD is excellent, and while some tracks might stand out (Bring Me To Life, My Immortal), there are some underrated tracks (Going Under, Tourniquet). Their songs are sometimes beautiful, sometimes hard. It is really hard to describe (I once described Going Under to a friend as hauntingly awesome) the kind of music that Evanescence plays, but this album is a very promising start for this group from Arkansas."
4,Who the heck would be better then Amy Lee? That's what I thought because Evanescence is the BEST band ever. It's cheap so buy it today.
4,"This is a decent album, even good at points, but this is nothing compared to Lacuna Coil, The Gathering, Within Temptation, Rhea's Obsession, Aghora, Collide, or Nightwish. Some believe this is the new direction of mainstream metal and maybe it is, but it's not new. Just new to the mainstream. If you like this, you will like the bands I named the same or probably more. Give them a chance if you really like Evanescence."
4,"the item i recieved had prompt shipping. It was in a sealed case, i would buy from this seller again"
4,"Whooop whoop. This cd rocks. The best one I have in my collection. First of all the cover is awesome. Second, every son in this CD is extremely awesome. Thirdly, evanescene is the best band ever. They have the best combination of rock and well Amy Lee. She is so good she is in a category all her own. She, in my opinion is the best female vocalist I have ever heard. And with Ben Moody backing her up on guitar. What a combo. If you were allowed to put your own number of stars I'd put like infinity stars. Whooooooop Whooooop :) :)."
4,"Evanescene is a great band, i like this cd because the songs are catchy. if you like them you should check out evanescence.com for more stuff on the band."
4,"I don't know why I waited so long to buy this CD. I absolutely love it. It's very rare that I like every song in any CD but I truly enjoy listening to all of them in Fallen. At first, I thought it was a little strange because of the two slow songs. It seemed out of place BUT after listening to the dark and haunting melodies, I was blown away. I was amazed at the range of Amy's voice. It's refreshing. She's not like the typical rock n roll singer. I recommend this 100%. Can't wait for their next album. I hope they stick around for a long time."
4,"i never heard of this band until very recently. It was playing on the radio and when the song came on i called the radio station, and they gave me the cd. i think it is an awsome new sound of music. its a good break from the happy go lucky music like smashmouth and sum 41. its more like a mixture of POD andkitty."
4,"WoW I am not a fan of this genre, so this was actually the first album that I bought and I truly loved it. This CD doesn't have many tracks, but big things come in small pacakges. I'd rather get 10-tracks that sound good then a 20-track CD with not much on it."
4,This cd is very fresh. This dark driven band meets all the mind setting goals that you can handle. Great sounds and moods. They get they're point across. Very art driven. Smart Love it
4,"Just when i was getting tired of metal because all new bands come up with something thats been done before and sounds like any other rock gig. Well now there's evanescence, which contrary to some criticism is a band with a unique sound. Yeah sure, goths been doen before, But hasd it been done with a female vocalist at the helm. Thats what makes this a great band. Amy lee has soaring vocals which add another dimension to songs which already have depth and gothic lyrics. The cd opens with tracks like ""going uder"" and ""bring me to life"" two tracks which give goth rock new meaning. And tracks like ""hello"" and My Immortal add variation. Everything's been done right here, from the amazing vocals to the upbeat rythms of the songs and great sounding guitars. Evanescence surely brings much needed innovation and creativity which is found lacking in most of todays bands."
4,"To tell you the truth, I didn't really like a few songs on Fallen. ""Everybody's Fool,"" ""Taking Over Me,"" and ""My Last Breath"" didn't work for me, but the rest of the songs did. ""Going Under"" caught my attention when I popped the CD into my boombox the first time. I don't think I can ever describe you how hauntingly beautiful it is. ""Bring Me to Life"" deserved to be a hit single: hard rock and heavenly vocals are easily a good combination. The piano version of ""My Immortal"" is featured here; prefer the full band version, though, but it's still likable. ""Haunted,"" ""Tourniquet,"" ""Imaginary,"" and ""Hello"" are some of the more satisfying songs that really pleases both ears. I'm not a big fan of Evanescence, but I do enjoy listening to this album occasionally."
4,"This album is a great way to break into the national music circuit. It has pop appeal, and rock heart. Their sound is like no one else on the market today. The band sounds amazing, their talents come together to create some soul-stirring music. I bought the CD after hearing ""bring me to life"" once on the radio. The CD has been in my player non-stop since then. I'm sure this will be the first of many amazing albums from this band."
4,"I purchased this CD after hearing several of this bands songs on the radio - and I absolutely love it!I put it on when I want to work out - the songs have a great beat, and tend to get you ""pumped up"" - and the time just seems to melt away (since I don't really like exercising, having this music is a big help).I'm not really sure how I would classify this music - rock? - I'm just not sure... I'd suggest listening to some of the songs through Media Player to decide for yourself.Overall, I give ""Fallen"" 2 thumbs up!"
4,"This is Evanescence's first album. They have a slightly unusual style, and this album is a little different than most mainstream music---it has elements of heavy metal, goth, choir, and pop music. Still, it doesn't really take any of these to the extreme and in my opinion sounds very good. Also, the lyrics, which are sung beautifully by Amy Lee, are clean and for the most part deep and intelligent.The album features the well-known singles ""Bring Me to Life,"" ""Going Under,"" ""My Immortal,"" and ""Everybody's Fool."" But this is one of those albums in which all the material is good, and I think it will appeal to many listeners."
4,"The lyrics and music on this albmun are some of the best I've heard in a long time. While every song has great merrit on it's own, you realy need to listen to the CD from start to finsih to get the most out of it. Songs flow from on to the next with a constient tone, yet each song retains it's induvidual identity.It should be noted the songs on this disc have a very dark theme. They deal with loss, rejection, betrayl and death. Songs on these topics are common in popular music. However, when you combine a passionate lead singer with great background vocals and a generally exellent sound you end up with something less common in recent musical ventures: an albumn worth buying."
4,"Two of the album's songs made it into the ""Daredevil"" soundtrack. A fairly uncommon result for a new band. While ""Bring me to Life"" got the play time, ""My Immortal"" is far more haunting and more enchanting. It's amazing that this was written prior to the movie, because it fits in so well with the scene following Electra dad's life. The whole CD is great !!"
4,"I haven't heard such a great album since i was born, perfect blend of goth rock misxd with 2 excellent ballads that can be listened to over and over again without tiring out the album!"
4,"When I heard the excellent single ""Bring Me to Life"" for the first time, I was enthralled. Just the depth in one song was enough to get me to buy the CD. And I was glad. With 11 songs (just enough to give you a good taste and leave you wanting more), you will find yourself singing along in no time. It starts with the opening song ""Going Under,"" a more hard-rock tune that gets you in the feel of the album. Then comes the single everyone's talking about, ""Bring Me to Life,"" which blends rock, pop and everything in-between in just four minutes. Each song following gets better and better (the exception Tourniquet, which is a love it or hate it song, and for me, it depends on the day). My favorites on the CD are My Immortal, Haunted, Hello, and Whisper. I love the choirs featured in the background. Pick up this CD. It's well worth the money. You'll be listening to it for years to come. Trust me."
4,"After seing the horrible flop, at least for fanboys and seekers of a true plot, that was Daredevil, I specifically noted the song Bring Me To Life in it's pulse-pounding soundtrack. I had delayed a few weeks, afraid of the other songs on this seemingly mediocre album, but I was very surprised.All of the songs are good in their own way, and the haunting piano melodies seem to amplify Amy's voice. The most notable songs, which there are many of, are Tourniquet, Going Under, Imaginary and the seriously noteworthy My Immortal, which is very calm for it's quite dark lyrics. Though it may not seem fitting, the composition in it is quite amazing.While this album is great, we all know how far a little thing called audio editing can go. Evanescence absolutely sucks in concert. I am not kidding. If you have this album, don't think about going to a concert.Peace Out,NW"
4,"Evanescance is awesome. I have so many nice things to say about Evanescance. It is the best Cd I ever purchased. every song is awesome. Amy Lee deserves a lot of credit having written lots of the vocals and lyrics to a lot of the album, and Ben Moody, although no longer a member of the band, having written lyrics and played guitar, and David Hodges on the piano. Track 9, HEllo, was a good example of his skills and the string arrangements and Amy's vocals. It was all amazing.The choir added a nice touch to nost of the album as well. The string parts (yes there are string parts in this album) are amazing too.Evanescance is worth every penny i will ever spend on them. Money well spent. THanks guys."
4,"I loved ""Bring Me To Life"" the first time I heard it on the radio. As awesome as that song is, it's just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the powerful, beautiful, haunting and mesmerizing music on this album. Amy's incredible voice will instantly grab you. The variety of song styles is suberb! The best new album out there right now!"
4,"Eventhough they have been around the Little Rock area for several years, I can never get enough of their music. Every song on THIS cd is great, but the true standouts are ""Going Under"", ""Bring me to life"", ""My Immortal"", ""Tourniquet"", ""Imaginary"", ""Haunted"",and ""Whisper"". This cd is worth more than you paid for it - so buy it now. Also, go see them in concert, very few bands sound as good in person as they do on their cd so check them out - they are really great musicians. I never thought it was possible to have a lead singer who makes you feel every single word that she is singing like AMY LEE does. The heavier songs show this emotion, but the slower songs will really take you for an emotional ride. Check out EBAY for more of their music, thier first CD is Origin."
4,"First i have to say that i'm a pop music lover, Britney, Christina, Etc. but this album is amazing considering that i don't like rock music, i was inspired to buy it when i fist heared BRING ME TO LIFE, then GOING UNDER and now MY INMORTAL which is an amazing song!!! I think if you're a pop music lover, you gonna love this album, even when is not really pop!"
4,"This is one of the best cd I have ever got, each song is vary good and there is not one bad song on the disc."
4,"I absolutely love this book. The author explains very well how we can heal our pets, same as our pets can heal us and they never ask anything in return. Healing your pet will bring you closer and it's also very rewarding."
4,"She's simply the best. Her range is stunning. This collection of songs is a great introduction to her range as a top worldwide talent. If I had to pick one song to download it would be ""THE OTHER WOMAN""."
4,"Protective, but too big for many midi controllers. Wish it included a removable section divider to keep the instrument planted in one half of the case."
4,"This is a clever romantic comedy that has something for everyone. Great for some laughs, a good story and movie to relax with."
4,"This cd is wonderful. It's doesn't matter if you're not into jazz. Whether you enjoy pop, rock, electronic, classical, folk - these recordings are irresistibly brimming over with joy, electricity, and talent. I can't imagine not owning at least a sampling of these recordings. Buy it. You won't regret it."
4,"Truly amazing! The first time I saw it, I bought it, and I've listened to it every day since. Two of the greatest jazz singers of all time, so completely opposite, yet blending so flawlessly--how can you not buy the CD? A must-have. 'Nuff said."
4,"The performances on this CD are so good, it doesn't matter to me.It really sounds like the artists are having fun in the studio."
4,"The essence of Steinbeck's novel is fairly accurate, if you can accept John Malkovich as the extremely physically powerful Lennie. Gary Sinise is a very good George."
4,"For my English Literature GCSE I had to read the book 'Of Mice and Men' by John Steinbeck. I quite likeed the book, but my English teacher (Mr. B) also made us watch the film as he thought that it was a very good interpretation of the book. After watching it I completely agreed.The acting is great, especially John Malkovich, and if your doing this book in your exams kids then I definately recomend you watch the film. Trust me it helps!"
4,"This looks like the real thing ~ flashing red lights in the front of my truck cab. Great deal for the price. My only complaint is that the sticky glue on the back doesn't stick to the dash or anywhere else. Just falls off. I put it in the ashtray ( I don't smoke ), where it's secure and visible. This item along with the decals and a steering wheel lock will keep out the amateurs...and doubtful a pro would want my truck. Glad I found it. Fast shipping with Amazon Prime."
4,"The best part of the movie is when Lewis has to leave Stowe because they will all be captured and all killed so he is forced to abandon her. He turns to her and tells her ""Whatever you do, stay alive!"" More powerful than telling her I love you, more powerful than any passionate proposal. The compelling part of the film is the chase and running of the film and the complex racial and political issues. This is a terrific film, its an excellent interpretation of the book and a great film to boot.Madeline Stowe, as always is a beautiful, compelling actress who uses her abilities of both beauty, strength and compelling emotion to the Nth degree here. This film first turned me on to them and while Lewis got an Oscar, Stowe has yet to receive hers but she deserves one as well."
4,"This movie was great. It is one of my all time top 10. I liked it a lot because it has a very big historical backround that makes the whole movie seem very real.If you like movies about historical events, war, or romance. This is a really good movie to get. And you never get tired of watching it."
4,"i was very disappointed, i did not know about region a and region b for blu ray.ticked me off a little because it was the first thing i have brought online and it was a gift for my mother, she absolutly loves this movie and it wouldn't play at all because we have an australian region player. as far as i could see from looking it up the australian region release of this movie comes out november 24. i wish the site had of warned me when i was purchasing it and getting it sent to australia that it would not play on australian region players. i'm still giving it 4 four stars because its a classic movie with great fight scene lots of drama and beautiful music and scenery."
4,"ithought the last of the mohicans was great movie. It is and exellent movie of action ,romance, sacrifice, and revenge. The movie had mostly great acting and a great plot. All of the the battle scenes had alot of action. Over all I'd give it four stars because it could have been a little more realistic as far as the kind of things characters did to procect others. Such as when the woman jumped off the cliff so that no more of the Mohicans would be killed.landon m. oakes"
4,This is really a wonderful movie to watch. Visually it is beautiful-just plain good story telling about real events.
4,I have the silent version of this movie & it is good so I wanted to see the newer one. Even tho it is the same story it is so different. The silent one wasn't as bloody. But this one was good also.
4,She has always been a wonderful singer. She does a great job in singing Ellas songs. I have a number of her albums and every one has been a gem.
4,"Although I was never a great Sarah Vaughan fan, this CD has convinced me that she has a great voice and is a great stylist. I do not think that anyone else can copy her style of interpreting a standard."
4,Dogs carry these around and have not destroyed them after two weeks. That is good.
4,My puppy loves this little toy -- I just wish it were brown instead of grey -- it looks too much like a mouse!
4,great little toy for my dogs. i have yorkies so they love it and it comes with an extra squeaker.
4,"ALL of Doctor Who stories are great! The Whoniverse is GREAT!The original meeting of the Silver Nemesis and Doctor Who is not known to me. It is referred to during the story.Also, a future meeting is talked about. I would like to know if that ever happened.I doubt it as Doctor Who ended production with Sylvester McCoy.That would be a good story line (are you listening Doctor Who Writers?) HA!All of the Whoniverse is worth watching! But then true Whovians know this already!"
4,"I bought this because it was a good price and looked decent, but it was better than decent. This is a good-quality, solid frame. It looks much nicer in person, too."
4,"This was a nice product. There isn't much to be said in a review. Wood trim looks nice, I would recommend."
4,"As she is heading out the door to get married, Sherrill finds her husband-to-be passionately kissing his love-struck secretary. What to do? When the fiance leaves for the church, Sherrill dresses the secretary in the wedding dress and send her on her way to marry the cheating fiance.It is while she is watching what is supposed to be her wedding that she meets Graham. He seems a bit too good to be true. Then, mysteriously, her emeralds go missing. My bet was on Graham being the thief. I will not spoil that part for you.In the end, love is found by all, a maid leads Sherrill to a personal relationship with God, and the emeralds are returned. It is a bit of a predictable story, but it is one to enjoy for the ride--not the destination."
4,"Within an hour of opening the box, I was scanning away. The PHOTO option is a must for anyone who has ever dreamed of organizeing pictures/photo albums. In about half of a day, I scanned in 8 rolls of film. The negative scanning feature allows you to get very high quality images quickly. Almost every picture I have scanned looks better after scanning it into the computer than the REAL print looks. This is a super (fast and high quality) scanner, and is well worth the investment."
4,"She has used them for many moons. Quality not all that great and they are throw aways after a couple years, so I just keep buying replacements over and over again. :) But they do have some bang for the buck!!!"
4,"Wonderful to see Yul Brynner with hair and jioned again with Charlton Heston this time as allies. Saw the first production of thius movie by Cecil B. Demill glad he revisited it and gave it to us in beautiful technicolor pairing Brynner & Heston was great. If your a Yul Brynner fan and would like to see him sporting a mop of hair check out Solomon and Sheba another great film. I am surprised there is such a lack of films about this period in are history, this movie might not be excactly historicaly correct but it is close & definatley entertaining and worth owning. Its a great way to introduce your children to a piece of american history since the popularity of the pirates of the caribbean the kids might find there history more palatable viewing this great movie."
4,"If you like ninjas,cartoons,or fighting games,this is the game for you! Naruto Clash of Ninja 2 for NGC is awesome.

4,"This book belongs in every occultist's library. Cunningham has left no stone unturned in his presentation of correspondences and substitutions. The book consists of several sections, each devoted to a specific topic, i.e., incenses, soaps, oils, brews, etc. Each section is alphabetically subdivided by purpose, astrological and plantetary influences, etc. Included for the adventurous are some recipies from older grimoires, along with safer modern blends aimed at the same goals. The incense chapter alone is worth the price of the book. After reading it, you'll never be dependent upon headshop joss sticks and cones again. Also included is a listing of sources for materials. In short, this book is an invaluable reference work, and belongs on every practicing magicians's bookshelf."
4,"Great album through and through. Accessible, dance/beat oriented with lyrics that go beyond the sufrace. 10 tracks of pure art but mind you this is accessible over some of thier other more abstract visions with throbbing gristle/psychic tv.....they still thrive. Look them up and check out the evolution of open minds!Stitchdv8Mike"
4,"Bought this for me and my son, but mostly for me!!! Even though I cannot sing AT ALL, it's still a lot of fun singing karaoke Wiggles!!! This would be great for birthday parties, playgroups, etc!!! Wiggle on!!!"
4,"I've learned that I am not in fact a codependent, however, I did have use of the book. Thank you."
4,Pleased with expedition of my order. The book has been helpful to the original purpose for ordering this title. I suggest it for anyone affected by addiction of those other than themselves.
4,This was a great resource for me as I learned to cope with my husband's alcoholism and my part in that situation. Very helpful suggestions to learn to change my behaviors pertinent to all areas of my life not just in dealing w/ alcoholic.
4,Very good book. It was recommended to my husband by a therapist. We both enjoyed it & found it extremely helpful.
4,"NOT taking on their burdens by shielding them from their reckless behavior. The best way to honor someone is to empower them to solve their own problems ... not enable their disease into destructive ends. Codependance confuses love with pity, rescue with romance, and sees unhealthy entanglement as partnership. The danger is that such relationships can last for years because it is frighteningly and overwhelmingly difficult to break away from one another. This book is a classic in preventing and releasing such terrible couplings.Caretaking is not about caring for the other person. It is about control and a ""you owe me"" mentality. It's human to expect things to go both ways. The challenge is to watch yourself so the tendancy doesn't have power over you like a compulsive machine."
4,"A stunning blend of funk and jazz that our friend Mr Powers would die for! I was given this as a gift by some friends in the US and I just havent been able to put it down in the 2 years i have had it. Whether you love jazz or not you will love this - its one of those suck it and see CD's and believe me you'll want to suck it more and more. For more soul that a pair of 70's platforms, this is the one for you. Just one question Pete......Are you gonna keep us waiting forever for the follow up!"
4,This is a great dvd with a lot of action Liked it very much that I got the next season thank you
4,"With this book, writing books just became faster, easier, cheaper and a lot more fun. Carmen Leal reveals where to find what you need in the world's largest library: the Web.

4,"They are comfortable and decent quality. The only surprise is how difficult they are to slip on. I have wide feet so it is difficult to slip them on when you are trying to put them on without using your hands. The main strap fits snug to the foot, which makes them more comfortable than other flip flops, but it is a pain if you need to take them on and off quick."
4,"This book is unique because it gives the reader concepts, thought process, tips, reading body language to aid in the perception of who may be lying or deceiving the reader in the Marketplace, Politics, and in Relationships of any kind. Bought it new and would recommend. Stuart. 02/08/2010"
4,I have read many books before. I thought this one is a very very good book. It keeps you entertained and has a lot of suspense from beginning to the end. It never gets real slow in parts unlike some books. The book is very realistic and is a historical fiction book. The only thing that I have against it is the details lag and it sometimes skips a month or two between chapters. I do however recommend this book to read. It is very interesting to read.
4,This was bought for a 9 year old as a gift and he is very very happy with the game and the condition it came in.
4,"Current television shows are more sophisticated and complex plots are standard. However, the first generation of westerns deserve a look. While Have Gun - Will Travel is a show I grew up with and remembering my youth is a part of the attraction, it is one of the first of its kind and laid down the traditions of a real ""good guys win out over the bad guys"" shows. Single tread plots are standard, but the acting is good and you will see many of the pioneers of television in their early roles."
4,"This book is a funny anti-war adventure story, but also so much more. It gives the reader an excellent sense of what it might have been like to live in the Austrian Empire in 1914-15. I know it sounds strange, but after reading this, Kafka begins to make sense. Read this book once for sheer entertainment, but then read it again and give it some thought. It's worth it!"
4,The three earlier reviews pretty much say it all. I agree 100% and wanted to add another 5 star rating.
4,"I have given these treats to our Horses for years. I have tried other brands & flavors but always come back to Peppermint Horse Treats. Our horses want nothing else. Forget to give them Peppermint Treats & try to leave the stable, the horses will remind you. You won't go wrong. We purchase the 5 pound bags by the case."
4,"I bought the entire set for my son but, since he's only 6 yrs. old, we haven't read this book yet. I was thankful to find a series on this subject that gave the information I was comfortable with providing for my son at the right age. My husband has been reading the beginning books with our son and they both enjoy the time together sharing this important information at an age appropriate level."
4,A great book to understand what green and sustainable environment exactly mean! a lot of good informations.
4,because my dogs love to lay in it and were bringing all sorts of creatures into my home. It seems to have stopped that from happening anymore.
4,"I love this back pillow, but my first 2 or 3 had leaks over a very short period of time. Why would I even try it multiple times? Because it's really a great product:-Easily Inflatable and Deflatable-Folds up so you can travel with it easily-Tremendously comfortable - better to have it inflatable so you can ""customize it"". Make it right for your needs. Also, if you're flying, as cabin pressure changes, you can alter the pillow so it stays the way that you need it.Now...I had this air leak issue. I contacted the company and they sent me several for free...just in case it happens again.The first of that batch they sent me is still the one I use...meaning the issue is solved!"
4,"I ordered this perfect inflatable back support cushion from Amazon which gave IMMEDIATE relief, for about $14. It is called the Back Booster 1001 Inflatable Lumbar Support Cushion. I shall recommend it to my physiatrist.I have spent (too) much time and money trying to find something that would be just right for travel and have now discovered that item! It really does fold up small enough to stick in your jacket pocket and it inflates/deflates easily.I have had to return several other products of this nature which just did not feel comfortable and cost as much as three times the price, thankfully I have now been refunded for all."
4,"Jack Ryan tries to stop an IRA fringe group from carrying out an assassination attempt on English royals and is subsequently brought back into the CIA in order to save his now threatened family. Patriot Games is a very good movie. The visuals are good, and the story is full of little twists and turns as well. If you have never seen it you're really missing out."
4,"DANCEHALL, say the liner notes, but this is close enough to ROOTS & CULTURE to make me happy. And it's tough! Once you get past Little Green Apples (it's not that bad!) and the title song (ever hear Bob M. sing about taking a girl in his Beemer?) the CD has a consistent, thematic roots pulse. Tabernacle Tree mix w/ Trinity is a great song, and this is close to a great CD."
4,Finally you can hear the stories about what happened on the great plains during the westward expansion from the Indian perspective.
4,"This case is less expensive and more serviceable than the Rok Sak, which I used to go through at a rate of 2-3 per year (zippers break, electronic prongs tear through the cloth). But it's definitely not stylish. The triple-layered pockets merely invite a huge bulge on the side of the case where cables, pedals, power supplies, etc. are stored. Also, the case is not a snug fit for a keyboard such as the Kurzweil SP-76. When you set the case down, moreover, it never stays positioned, always falling to the flat side.Still, it comes with a handy strap, making it possible to carry a light-weight 76-key keyboard with the gig bag slung over your shoulder, one or even both hands freed up for carrying an amp and piano stand, thus making for a one-person hauling job."
4,"This book has it all...tire-smokin' facts on the stars of drag racing, past and present, the whole scene...the bands and songs, the art, everything about the fast and loud world of drag racing. Read it now!"
4,"Timothy B. Schmit is by far one of the most talented artists around today. His pure, sweet voice and the great licks on the bass guitar are what makes him so special. It was nice to hear that he has always had his trademark sound, and even sounds better today. This album from almost 20 years ago stands up to anything anyone is doing now, and is a nice reminder of how songs sounded in the 80's, and yet has a contemporary feel to it. It would be a good choice to add to others by him, especially if you are a big fan."
4,I've owned this printer for years now in an office environment and it's still going strong. It needs a cleaning now and again as the rollers stop feeding paper but it's quite easy to accomplish.
4,"What a riot! A black cabaret motown singer witnesses her boyfriend killing someone - 'I've never seen a dead guy before! - I mean, you see the odd body on the freeway, but that's it'. She ends up under witness protection at a convent. She is predictably bored with the monastic life, but soon finds her niche - taking over the dilapidated choir. She fuses religion with the spirit of motown and gets the nuns singing. They prepare for a visit of the pope - but the mob are also on her trail. Which will prevail in the swinging and thrilling musical climax?"
4,"In a tailor-made role, Whoopi Goldberg stars as a Motown lounge-singer in Reno who witness the murder of a chauffeur at the hands of her married boyfriend and mobster, Harvey Kietel. When she goes to the police, they need to hide her some place safe, and they find a place where no one would think to look for the mistress-singer ... a convent. Maggie Smith also stars as the Mother Superior who agrees to shelter the newly christened Sister Mary Clarence, and in the hands of Whoopi, you can guess what happens to their woefully inadequate choir. This is one of those films it's hard not to like. The role was made for Whoopi, and she plays it for all it's worth. The nuns are all cute, the fish out of water story has built in laughs, and the music is terrific - really gets the toes tapping. There's nothing deep or earth shattering here, and thank God for that. It's simply a film about singing out your joy and serving others. In other words, it's a feel good movie and a lot of fun."
4,"I enjoyed this when it came out, just as millions of other folks did. It had a nice feel to it, good humor, great music and it didn't offend, from believer to atheist. It even had some action scenes. Many movies which combine genres (i.e. action and comedy) wind up successes. It's not a bad formula.Although Whoopi Goldberg is the undeniable star of this movie, Kathy Najimy as ""Sister Mary Patrick"" almost steals the show as the bubbly nun. However, always a sucker for a pretty and wholesome face, I preferred Mary Wickes as ""Sister Mary Lazarus."" She had this shy countenance to her before blossoming with her voice. Maybe that's why she had the name Lazarus as her personality rose from the dead."
4,"This is one nice piece of literature. It is fun to read, and exciting, for starters- plus there is depth as well. Wouk is one of the best novelists that this century has seen- all of his stories are good and especially this one. Queeg, Keith and Keefer are great characters. There is tension as you turn the pages that grates like finger nails on a chalkboard, only you cannot stop reading as in the best of nightmares. I Don't want to give too much away, but once this peaks, the Court-Marital follows through and does not disappoint. There is a reason why Wouk won the Pulitzer for his work on this one!"
4,I've been using this product for the past 5 years or so and I've always been satisfied. I paid a little more this time though because the previous vendor did not have it available. It's still worth it.
4,"I have purchased this protein for the last year and cant imagine going to something else.It mixes in water with no lumps, not thick so easy to swallow, and taste great.I have been seeing great results and quick recovery after drinking this vs. other protein supplements.I wanted to push to see if they can provide a subscribe and save on this product so for people like me that order a 5lb container every month can save a little money.I am sure there are many who would love to have this benefit.I have only tried Chocolate and Double Chocolate...I never get sick of it. Like drinking chocolate milk."
4,"Got a good deal on it, its popular, tastes good, and was shipped and arrived on time. Thanks!"
4,"I was unlucky enough to order strawberry. Anyone ever have pepto bismol? That will be the exact flavor and taste. I've asked several friends what this smelled like, and they came up with the exact same answer. After a while I had to force my friends to help finish the rest of my powder. The other flavors are awesome, and it's a great product which is why I gave it four stars instead of one."
4,First I wanna say that the reason i picked this brand was because it has won awards for best protein supplement product and because it was very popular on amazons most purchased list. I am reviewing the Cookies and Cream flavor and if i blind tasted this product i would not be able to guess and flavor. The flavor isnt so much cookies and cream but a sweet something. I also would not be able to tell you this is a protein powder shake because 1 scoop in a blender bottle has 0 chalky texture. There is no chalky flavor just sugar milk. I am going to increase the amount of milk per 1 scoop because it has that same sugar effect as Yoo-Hoo cholcate milk. Its a bit sweet but not chalky. I will continue to use this product.
4,"This Whey Protein is absolutely delicious. If somebody served it up to me in a glass and told me it was a light chocolate milk I would never know the difference! To be fair, I have not tried other protein powders so I can't compare, but this one really does taste amazing.In terms of performance, it is always difficult to tell if a protein powder is working. I would say it is. Over a 6 month span of working out and consuming ON Whey I was able to see muscles take shape across my body and put on about 8 pounds - not of fat either. I would say this stuff works pretty well for me and based on reviews for most other people as well."
4,"Years ago, I did a fairly extensive ""taste test"" of all of the major protein powders on the market. Every single one disappointed me: they were either too expensive, tasted terrible, didn't mix up well, or usually some combination of all three. This was the first powder I found that would mix perfectly (PERFECTLY) in a simple shaker (no blender needed!), tasted just like chocolate milk (the other flavors are lacking for me), and was very reasonable per scoop. Lately, the price on this has ratcheted higher and higher, but I'm not ready to start hunting for a replacement. It fills me up as a post-workout shake!"
4,I was a little skeptical about chocolate mint flavored protein powder. Boy was I wrong. This stuff is delicious. Mixes well. I can't think of anything bad to say about it. I highly recommend.
4,"I've tried other whey products and always come back to this one. It is not the cheapest but it is the best one that I have used. It mixes very well. Most importantly, the taste is excellent. I used to get the Vanilla Ice Cream. It is really good if you want to mix some fruit in a blender. The Double Rich Chocolate is my standard though. The taste does not get old like some of the others I've tried. One thing I like best is that I can fill a mixing bottle (this is a great one Single 20oz Sundesa Blender Bottle) with powder, keep it with me and fill it with water when I need it. It still tases wonderful with water instead of milk."
4,"I recommend it because I am trying to lose weight (and succeeding). I've lost 20 lbs this month, but that's incorporating eating healthier (higher protein diet and organic food) and excersize. I drink one shake in the morning (I just mix it with 8 oz of skim milk), and one after weight training. It works for weight loss because it does not contain all of the fat, calories, and carbohydrates that other protein powders contain, e.g., Muscle Milk. Don't get me wrong Muscle Milk is good for those trying to bulk up, and pack on the muscle. This protein powder simply gives me the protein that I need to build/maintain muscle compostion which subsequently burns my body fat."
4,"I have tried other powders such as EAS, GNC, etc. This is by far the best and easiest to mix. I use a blender bottle to make sure is mixed well but forgot it one day and just put some in bottle water which worked with no lumps. Great protein too, 24grams in 1 scoop! Also taste is much better than others I have had. French Vanilla creme has the creme aftertaste which I am not a huge fan of (even with rootbeer), but still much better taste than other name brands. Will try chocolate next."
4,I have used optimum 100% whey for a few years. It tastes pretty good and mixes easily and it does not contain milk products to upset my stomach. Amazon has supplied this product at a great price and is an excellent company to do business with.
4,This is a very good product for the price. It delivers a big protein bang for the buck and keeps fat and sugar to a minimum. The flavor is good when mixed with water and great with milk. Hard to go wrong with this stuff.
4,"i never use any protein,i purchased this product by reviews and rating, so the taste is good and easy to prepare, but for result i will comment after when i will fineshed"
4,"This is a great product, I am a crossfitter that works out about 5 times a week so I take 4 scoops a day. What I have seen with this product is that I feel solid, so I have gained lean muscle and my recovery time is much faster. I have used the AMP GNC before and it was good as well but this product seems to be the same and cheaper."
4,"I have consistenly been working out for the last three years and have tried just about every store bought whey protein, mass gainer, creatine and other suppliments out there. I've used this for the last 4 months and I think I found my new favorite suppliment. I use alittle more than the average serving, but mix it in 24ounces of milk with a bananna and a few other vitamins. I haven't changed up my workout schedule, but I notice a considerable gain......and its not just waterweight like creatine or other suppliments I have used. HIHGLY Recommend"
4,"Excellent stuff. I am using On's 100% whey since about a year now and I highly recommend this product. Esp, the double rich chololate tastes like heaven, easily mixes with milk/water and leaves no stomach bloating etc. This product on amazon is a bargain and you should not let go. Get the 10 pound box and save $30. This is great stuff, if you want to grow, get this ASAP."
4,it's optimum nutrition's 100% whey protein .it's a great basic protein shake .can't ask for more . .
4,Some people do not like the taste of this one but I do and think it goes well with the soy milk that I mix it with.
4,"I'm a VERY picky eater! Just ask my girlfriend, family and friends :-)Yet I must say that this is is a good drink! That is if you like chocolate. Mix one cup of the powder (very fine) along with 8 oz of milk (skim, etc.) and it taste even better than chocolate milk! The secret is to mix it up REAL good! I mean for minute, or if you have a mixer or blender that's even better. But I usually (for time reasons) mix it after breakfast with a spoon then drink it up.The price has gone up since a year ago. However I think that's because it's gone up everywhere else as well. However with having it shipped free to your house and no tax (through Amazon), you don't have to go wrong! No lugging it home in a huge bag/box, just order and have it delivered to your door free!"
4,"I've haven't been using it for very long, so I can't say much about results. But this stuff is absolutely delicious. My friend has it in chocolate and he's gotten pretty big. So I decided to buy it. I recommend it to anyone."
4,"gooooooooood a+fast shipping.purchased for my neighbor with a blender bottle and it came quickly, dissolved well, and is very healthy."
4,The taste is much better than any protein powder I've tried so far. I totally recommend this!The only reason I give it a 4 is because it remains clumpy after stirring like 10 million times. I should try a shaker...
4,"This whey protein is the best I've tried. It tastes good, actually works, and it's cheap. I've only tried delicious strawberry but I've heard great things about all the other flavors. I've also tried GNC's Wheybolic Extreme 60. I hated the flavors so I can't say if they really work or not. The Gold Standard is my new go to protein. You can pick up 2 pounds for around $27 or 3 pounds of Wheybolic for $70 at a GNC. The Gold Standard is just as good if not better and it's much, much cheaper. I recommend this protein 100%. Don't just take my word for it, there are hundreds of other happy customers out there. Don't even think twice about buying this one. It's awesome."
4,"I've been using this protein all summer and it has worked great. Two of my friends were on other protein brands and ended up switching over to Gold Standard after seeing what a value it is for what you get. Double Rich chocolate tastes great, and it contains everything you need in a good post-workout protein. Just add water or milk and you are good to go. Add some yogurt, peanut butter, and fruit and you have a suitable meal supplement as well!"
4,This stuff is great for post workout or a healthy bridge in between meals. Tastes pretty good. The Double Chocolate is a good balance - not too sweet like the Extreme Chocolate. It mixes great in water and even better in milk. Goes down good and my stomach agrees with it. I have definitely added some lean mass since I began using this product 4 months ago. The 5 pound tub lasts me right at a month. I have no reservations when it comes time to pony up the $53 for another one. Best whey protein I've used.-Legend
4,Delicious! I would recommend this product. It tastes great and mixes well with milk. No lumps or anything like that.
4,"I've only tried the Vanilla, will be getting chocolate next time. Mixes up easy, tastes just fine mixing with water. Take 30 minutes after working out and keeps the boiler running till lunch."
4,"I didn't like the taste at first when I was doing 1 scoop per cup of milk, but I found that more is better. I like the mixture 2 scoops per 1.25 cups of milk, blended. Any more and it stops dissolving completely."
4,One of the better flavors. I was bored of the usual chocolates and not too impressed with the taste. The slight hint of coconut hasn't forced me to alter any recipe and in my opinion tastes better when mixed with water or milk compared to the standard chocolates. Will buy again.
4,"Great resource for anyone in the music industry that needs help starting out! The indie bible branches out to everyone including promotions, marketing, venues, management, booking, etc... Great way to network as well. For those who want to advertise your business i.e., graphic artists, web design, button making, etc... get yourself listed in the book and you will be contacted. The book is revised all the time and is also set up geographically. A must have."
4,"I love the fact that this rack takes up very little space, but the spice selection is a bit impractical, some of the spices I haven't used in the two years that I've had this item. For example crushed mint, corriander, mustard seeds, and marjoram. How about some chili powder, paprika, crushed red pepper and cumin instead? The other spices were good though, all in all a good buy."
4,We have had this spice rack for several years. It has held up well and we have used most of the spices. I have yet to figure out what a couple of them are for though... It is a nice sturdy wood and it fits nicely back under the upper cabinets (it isn't too tall). It would look/work great in almost any kitchen.
4,"I used a Remington for quite some time, but then started traveling a great deal. The Remington could not withstand the shock and broke quite often. A razor repairman suggested that I try a Braun.The Braun cruzer Z-50 is an excellent razor. It's very sturdy, has a long lasting battery, many features and provides a consistent and close shave. I recommend it highly."
4,"After spending more than half of his life in solitary, when a convict (sentenced for having killed 2 people) says: ""Life is one of the most precious gift and its the duty of life to live"", one wonders if redemption was over or not for him. Though, he never came out of the prison, but redemption in the sense of understanding the meaning of life certainly unfolded to this ornithologist, who became a self-taught authority on curing bird's diseases while serving life-sentence. This movie is an amazing depiction of a true story, about dedication, perseverance and relentless pursuit of ""free thinking"" from a prisoner-turned-author."
4,"Battery appears to be as good a quality as the original that came with my phone. I am pleased with my purchase, but I was displeased wtih the shipping costs (~ 11 dollars for two tiny batteries). The costs were higher because the batteries did not ship directly from Amazon."
4,"Fit perfectly in my wok. Not sure if its dishwasher safe, but I put it in the dishwasher all the time and it still works. I'm really glad I bought it. :)"
4,"Blues, rock, and jazz are all in here but strained down to their essence and played with tremendous energy. Three virtuoso musicians coalesce into something great. This is a wild wild wild trip and the music is a real layer of sonic energy. Williams' drumming it at its greatest and most idiosynchratic, and McLaughlin's guitar playing combines the best elements of his work with Miles and early Mahavishnu. Unlike anything else ever recorded and a real underappreciated classic work."
4,"What do you get when you mix a conniving Tony Curtis as a shady grifter with an accident on two legs like Claudia Cardinelli in a plot that involves beach front house along a gorgeous stretch of Malibu Beach? The kind of outrageous pandemonium that only a Hollywood screenwriter could imagine. Yet it is also an interesting character study of a number of individual minor characters, and it is this aspect of the film that makes its histrionics and dumb jokes somehow more palatable. Watch for the scenes with the late and beautiful Sharon Tate and big bodybuilder Dave Draper, who ignite on screen together in a sweet and almost innocent way in front of the camera. Big Dave never made a career in fims, but this movie shows he could act, and that he had a unique sort of charisma on-screen at that. I save this one for cold winter nights when my California dreaming is at a fever pitch. I always seem to enjoy it. I hope you will too."
4,"I always enjoyed a good Hunter game because players are in control of supernaturally imbued characters who are entirely clueless to the World of Darkness. Thankfully with the well written, and familiar, rules, you have the opportunity to fight back against the creatures who prey on humanity. This is not an investigate and run away game like Call of Cthulhu.With that said, a good game requires that the cluelessness is maintained to keep the level of excitement up. You can have players who know about the World of Darkness, but that information should not influencing their character's in-game decisions. A Hunter is not going to know a Brujah from a Gangrel or that a large man in a business suit is a Glasswalker.Overall, Hunter was my favorite of the ""old-school"" White Wolf/World of Darkness games/settings. The basic rules are consistent with the other titles in the line, with only a few variations. This made it easy to pick up and start playing on our first night with the rule book."
4,"The Blender does a good job in terms of crushing ice, however there is room for improvement on the design of the blade for enhanced chopping & liquefying.Also, at times the rubber seal leaks, needs adjutment to stop the leak."
4,"I got this blender after my Krups blender died. Then I tried the cuisinart which died 5 days after I bought it, and it was noisy enough to wake the dead. I absolutely love my new Kitchen Aid blender. It does an amazing job at any speed crushing ice and blending my morning protein shakes. It is also extremely quite, so I don't wake everyone in the house when I make my shakes in the morning. I would highly recommend this blender to anyone looking for a quality blender that is also quiet."
4,"A stunningly catchy CD that never seems to stop. Dancing seems to flow from the CD as well smooth rythym and lyrics. This CD cannot be comapred to any groups as they have a sound of their own, but if you like variety in your dance tunes and want something not heard everyday on the myriad or repeating radio stations, this CD is for you! Definately unique and a great addition to any CD cabinet. Smooth, not harsh, quick, upbeat, and not ""top-40"" music, but easy to get into. Not a re-hash of the same beat on the radio today."
4,"Clive Nichols' sensual & seductive photographs in ""Planting Companions"" by Jill Billington, provide wonderful ""eye candy"" to tide one over a dreary winter. The photographs actually give a better idea about what could be successfully planted together than the author's prose. The book is seemingly geared for the novice gardener, but then, the author does not pretend to be writing for the garden professional or landscape designer. Instead, she has written a very readable book about form, texture, pattern, & suitable planting partners, along with some information about plant size & growth habits. It is a ""trendy"" book that encourages dreaming."
4,"The most important ""success secret of the ancients"" I think is revealed on page 25: ""I found the road to wealth when I decided that a part of all I earned was mine to keep."" So to start getting rich you have to save, but how much? The ""First Law of Gold"" has the answer: ""...not less than one-tenth of his earnings...""The book's basic message in plain language is: If you want to be wealthy, save and invest at least 10% of your income. If you are already following this message this book won't help you. But if thinking of saving and investing as ""ancient secrets"" and ""Laws of Gold"" is what it takes to get you motivated to save then this book is for you.I deducted one star because one-tenth is not aggressive enough. The ""First Law if Gold"" should be at least 15%. There are signs that inflation after a long absence is on the way back."
4,"The ""Richest Man in Babylon"" is a series of parables tasking place in the ancient city of Babylon.The main point of this book is to show people their ambitions can come true through being successfulin money. It is amazing how much this book can help others.I believe it should be a mandatory book that we have to read during our last year of high school.It teaches you valuable principles in saving and investing money. This book should be read by everyonefrom middle school to the college level students, employees, executives and the self employed. Anyonewho is serious about their finacial future should read this book.George Clason also writes in this book about other people having to manage their households. Even thoughthis book was writing about ancient times poeple can still relate in a certain way. This is why ireccommend reading this book."
4,"For anyone who is trying to better understand money, this is the book to start with. In uncomplicated language, and thru storytelling the author explains the timeless principles of money accumumlation and preservation. I recommend it for all ages 12 and up, but especially for persons who are presently experiencing money troubles. You will see yourself in this book, and you will identify with the age-old problem of how to better manage money. It will be the best money you ever spent on a single book. Write me. share your thoughts after you've read the book. Best wishes."
4,"Rev 17:5And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.KJVBabylon had a lot going for it, especially prosperity, however I find that the mighty city did not have God and to me that is a very disapointing issue. I found this book a great resource in proverbs and insights into monetary principles. I measured this book against ""The Greatest Salesman in the World"" and found it wanting. I did pick up a handful of insights and for that I would reccomend the book at fair market value.I believe the Christian would find more information on Godly wealth in Proverbs.~Job 36:1111 If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.KJV"
4,The definition of a classic. The principles in this book have stood the test of time. Don't listen to the talking heads who hype up that times are different. Build you foundation first. Learn the principles. They don't change.
4,"I bought this book to use in my high school economics class. I particularly like the Seven Cures to a Lean Purse section. Typically I have my students read this chapter and then create a brochure or powerpoint presentation outlining the seven ways to become ""rich"". Good story telling with somewhat complicated language; however, even my low level students are able to pick up the general idea. I would recommend this book to other economics teachers."
4,This little book is full of big things! It is an easy read but a surprising structure. There are valuable truths contained therein.
4,"this is a fantastic book. i recommend it for everyone.. i listen to it during my commute, and enjoying listening to it every few months.. Buy it, you wont regret it."
4,"A book everybody should read, especially in these times. I'll surely recommend it among my friends and dear ones. Don't miss it."
4,"Well I finally invested in a copy of this book after putting it off until tomorrow, yada yada yada... I wished I had read it 10 years ago because it was an inspiration and so easy to read. I have started to follow the guidelines and it works,man does it work, it just goes to show that simple is the best. I wish this was compulsery reading in schools because the youth of today would benefit from this knowledge tomorrow."
4,"Sound financial advice that everyone can understand. The hardest part for most people will be to put it into practice. Delayed gratification is something that this society hardly teaches anymore. I am ordering several copies for recent college graduates, hoping they start off right."
4,"you really can't convey with words the emotions that this album contains--it is emergency! on crack! it is also an album where williams effectively adds and removes layers of the music which really puts you, the listener, in a different state of awareness. the music is also aggressive--moreso than the stooges, mc5, hendrix, any of them... you just have to listen to the record!"

4,"For most, weather happens! It affects our lives in countless ways and sometimes wreaks havoc on them. Unless one personally experiences the sheer violence of weather like a tornado or a hurricane, we go along just being inconvenienced by it and muttering how it forced cancellation of the picnic or the golf game. Stewart's novel is a wonderful story of the seeming innocence of an obscure storm system developing far, far away that eventually will dramatically impact men's and women's lives in western United States. The people stories are poignant and suspensful as each is tied to this relentless and powerful storm as it develops and makes it's way to our shores. One gains tremendous appreciation and respect for the patterns, intensity and often times the unpredictable nature of weather -"
4,"I don't know a great deal about Turkish music ""but I know what I like."" This pulsating collection of classic tunes from the country that is a bridge between Europe and Asia will have anyone shaking their hips."
4,"I love this one as much as The Wee Free Men. You not only have to read it, you have to own the book."
4,"Of all the books we have for our kids, this is one that is most likely to elicit smiles and sounds from our 14 month-old twins. We have our own sound effects for each page of opposites, and both kids try to imitate us (with our daughter doing a rather frightening ""roar""). Each page features a series of opposites, such as ""Dinosaur roar...dinosaur squeak"". Finally the book ends with the dinosaurs having an excellent lunch. The pictures are colorful and expressive. However, it is the one book with a picture that I find quite disturbing - the meek dinosaur is cringing on its page, with the shadow of a bigger dinosaur clearly baring its teeth, leading to the conclusion the meek dinosaur is about to become lunch, and I find that a little scary. Other than that, I highly recommend the book."
4,"No stone left unturned! Even if you don't support a TruCluster, this is a must have book for any Tru64 admin. You can gain insight into system internals, storage management, sysadmin tools like ca, etc. Packed with tips, tricks, and custom scripts. In short- lot's and lots of goodies!"
4,I read this book many years ago as a teen and it has remained in my memory every since. It touched my heart to the core. Amazing story indeed!
4,I purchased this for a queen bed and it fits perfectly. Wasn't too bad to put together. Netting is good quality covers a good portion of the side . Very supportive being used tohold a 4 year old from rolling out of bed. Would recommend it
4,"Great rail. We are currently using it on an Ikea bed where the frame comes up around the mattress. The rail is really wedged in there and once the mattress (which weighs a ton) sits on it, this rail is not moving. So, we're not really able to use the drop side feature but it works great the way we have it. Very sturdy. Thinking about getting another for the other side. Definitely long enough for a Queen or King size bed. Reasonably priced!"
4,"I bought this for my grandson, when he sleeps over and it serves its purpose. In all fairness it is not used much but thats why I like the feature that you can hide it easily under the bed. It has easily fitted both a queen and twin and been moved, but its somewhat hard to slide the clamps under a larger mattress. Minutes to assemble. I like the fact that you can slide it down and hide it under the mattress. Extra long for those kids that roll around in bed. The only negative is that its somewhat ""wobbley"" and not as sturdy as I had thought. Also the metal fold down elbows protrude from the mattress. I cover them with a down comforter for safety purposes. For $28.00 it does the job."
4,"I couldn't believe how fast it got to me.It was in factory condition and it was the one I was looking for but I was really surprized to see that the sound was in THX.My old version was on VHS tape and it really went bad through the years so I gave up on getting it.The place that sold me this is called the Book Groove, I never heard of them before but they provided great service."
4,"As a wee lad, this movie shaped my tender consciousness. I could relate so well to its hero, Dar, a sensitive outcast in communion with nature. I found my own story in his, having one's town burned by the Junts, seeking revenge on child-sacrificing priests, courting a slave girl, using no more than ten words a day, rubbing my body to a gleam with bear grease. At the time it made no difference to me that cinematography could be so jolting and inconsistent (my favorite is the unconscious Dar being pulled by his dog to safety; the dog lets go and the body keeps moving). The theme is one for the ages. Everything about the man I am today can be traced back to this sensational epic."
4,"Duvall and Schell are in their roles of a lifetime as both Stalin and Lenin. Julia Ormond seems too classy to be believable, and Roshan Seth doesn't look like Beria at all; Bob Hoskins should have been cast for the part. Aside from that, it's one of the best docudramas ever made, and only goes to prove that Duvall is the most talented, and underrated, actor alive! I saw him in ""Wrestling Ernest Hemingway"" and didn't believe an American could play a Cuban so thoroughly convincingly as he did. You just couldn't tell the difference. Same thing here!"
4,An important book for those attempting to understand ancient culture. Cohen uses insights from classical law and anthropological data that helps one to better understand the nature of legal proceedings in ancient Greece. A must for any Classics or Biblical studies student.
4,Dr. Walston has put together the ultimate resource for distance learning. He sheds new light on the topic of distance learning and helps to dispel the myths of accreditation. With all the colleges out there these days offering distance learning it is hard to tell the sheep from the wolves. If this ominous task has kept you from pursuing your education then you need toget this book and let Dr. Walston's expertise help you to make one of the most important decisions of your life!
4,"I consider my self lucky enough to get to know Antony's music, especially this album reminded me the feeling of something powerful, something that stays in your mind forever like The Wall-Pink Floyd or Grace-Jeff Buckley or led zeppelin III(list goes on). this album is an instant classic -if you are open minded toward music you should get this one."
4,This book was very good! It was an easy read and very fast paced that I read it in 1 day!Kisa Kane (Montega) was a real ride or die chick she was smart and not naive like alot of hustlers wives or girlfriends that I am use to reading about in urban novels! I was satisfied with the ending but was hoping for a little bit more but its all good maybe one day there will be a sequel!
4,"This is an old favorite of mine I remember it from the late 70's, it was'nt to gory and had a pretty good story lineI think this would be a pretty good remake. I believe Robert Thompson's role as the title character Patrick was not as easy as it appeared to be, it probably took total consentration to lay there starring like that with everyone around you interacting. Everyone turned in a good performance. especially ""Julia Blake as Matron Cassidy"" the head nurse and ""Robert Helpmann as Docter Roget"" the owner of the clinic. The special effects were good for a low budget film it stands out on it's own as compared to ""Carrie"". And ""Susan Penhaligon was very charming as nurse Jacquard""."
4,I CAN NOT BELIEVE HOW MUCH FUN I'VE HAD WITH THIS GAME. IT REALLY HELPS ME GET MOST OF MY STRESS OUT AFTER HVE A BAD DAY. IT'S REALLY A LOT OF FUN.
4,"Who are the Hutterites? I had no idea. This documentary was responsible for opening my eyes to a completely different world of God-Fearing people. I knew much of the Amish and Mennonites but not the Hutterites. This film explores, with modesty and fairness, this group of men and women living, I believe, in North Dakota. They are simple folks: farming supplies the majority of their livelihood and they are kind to the environment, have an unyielding love of God and are not ashamed to share their beliefs with a world that, otherwise, does not understand their lifestyle. Appreciation for these gentle people will help people of all religions understand the importance of community and worship. I am so glad they still make documentaries like this. This film contains no objectional material, however there is a scene in which ducks are butchered that may disturb younger viewers."
4,This beautiful etched amethyst glass feeder is just as advertised. I hung it up as soon as I received it (which was very prompt). The first day several of my Hummers used it. I have it just outside my kitchen window so I can enjoy watching them feed.

4,"David Ruffin,one of r&b's pure singers,with this release has proved to us once again that he was one of the premier balladeers.The way David can go from a tender touch to an incredible wail in just a couple of notes,reminds us just how remarkable his voice was."
4,"I have an bike with the older seat clamp style with the bolt & nut. I rounded the nut with a wrench so it was stuck.This vise grip worked but you have to make sure you get it on very tight. I initially found two sides on the nut that were the flattest and tried to remove with the vice semi tight. It started to spin around the nut.So I immediately stopped, reset the pliers a little tighter and it worked fine. Also, the length allows you to put both hands on it if you need the extra force.This price was cheaper than the local hardware store."
4,I don't understand why people say that this book is anti-war. The book is based on a true story of a Canadian soldier who was a basket case. Johnny simply presents what does happen in every war--carnage. Is anyone reading this in college or high school? I'd love to hear from you.
4,"This is among the oldest and saddest stories of all mankind's blunders. Exactly, what can modern (and ancient) weaponry do to one man, and one man's body? You can learn by reading this, the story of a survivor, who has only his brain left after his participation in the ""Great War"". Slowly, this person realizes his predicament. There were nearly 10 million dead from this abomination of a war, but this soldier was among the 20 million injured. Must reading for high school youth, but certainly not on the recommended reading list of any national military force. Read it and weep!"
4,"When I was 16, I typed the entire book, on a selectric typewriter (for those of you who are much younger, these were typewriters that had a number of different ""balls"" that changed the font.) The typed pages were ""mimeographed"" (another obsolete machine) to be given to the students in September. It is one of those books that keeps you reading and reading without a break. I've been looking for a copy for many years and am so glad I found this on Amazon. I'm now 61 and still find the book incredible!"
4,"I personally liked the book, but I wish it didn't have a cliffhanger ending. I don't like cliffhanger ending, because I want to find out what happens next. Just my two cents, and Happy New year."
4,"The only thing wrong with this album is its name; the phrase ""24 KARAT GOLD"" should be replaced with ""PLATINUM"". This is a must have collector's item. It would be disastrous if we went into next millenium without this valuable artifact.Everyone should have this reggae bible.Trust me you won't need skip any of the tracks when get this cd; if you do you may e-mail your expletives to me at gawain@ignmail.com."
4,"I am sure the product is fine, but it does not fit the Z3 (at least not mine, 2001). If you need one for a z3, get Metra 40-vw10 instead. This one worked perfectly. Maybe I could have figured that out before ordering if I spent more time. Otherwise, I am sure this is a fine product if it fits your car."
4,I bought this book for my grandson. He never gets tired of hearing it. The book has a nice rhythm and great pictures.
4,"by Lynn Nicole Louis""Coyote"" is a compilation of eight previously published stories, including the Hugo-nominated ""Stealing Alabama"" and ""The Days Between."" As such, it doesn't read like a traditional novel, since the focus of the segments is on different characters. Too, each story is self-contained; overall they fail to form the traditional arc a reader usually finds in a novel. This is not bad, just different and maybe disorienting to a reader who might be expecting a regular book. It might be better to approach this as a themed anthology, than a novel.For science fiction fans, this one is a must-read.Lynn Nicole LouisRead the full review at www.SFReader.com"
4,Maxis has done it again! This has to be their best game ever! Its too hard to explain how good it is so I won't even try!
4,"FINALLY! All of us simmers have been waiting for the chance to play with a family AWAY from the home! The houses are great, but sometimes a Sim needs a change of scenery :) That's where the downtown comes in. You can change the stores, decide what should be sold, and basically do whatever you want! My only wish would be that it would give more empty lots for development. Other than that, it's great!"
4,"Hot Date. The name gives it away. Does having a girl over sound hot? No. You need to go out to eat or just get away from the house. I made a single dad with three kids, had a girl over and the kids came in every five minutes. This new expansion will be a great enhancement. And if you really want to have fun, you can flirt with the waitress while on a date. Maxis wanted this to be big, and it is...."
4,"To all the people who said the game was slow.... I don't exactly have the fastest computer but it works just fine on my computer. I only have a Pentium 266 with 96 megs of ram. It's strange because the box says minimum of a Pentium 300. And they recommend 128 megs of ram. All I do is close everything except explorer and systray and it works great! It's not slow at all. I love this game! If it didn't work, I was going to upgrade my computer, that's how much I love the Sims! :)"

4,"I still remember this movie after all theses years, and I believed I have only seen this once or twice. It was shown in the best atmosphere...I was up 2 AM or so, and everything is just so quiet at that time. I felt every emotion of this film thoroughly. This movie is one of those gems, and I'm not suprised, because the 80's produced several memorable movies for me. This movie deals with longing, hopefulness, virginity, and some fun. I used to try to look for this movie from time to time, and had forgotten the title. I was irritated , because I remembered the name Eddie, and everytime I'd look it up; the title; Eddie, that basketball movie w/ Whoop would show up, and I'm like NOoooo!!! Well I will continue my search for a dvd, and if not I'll just order the VHS, there is still many good movies which haven't made the switch: The Dummy (starring Levar Burton), Leadbelly, and some others I'd really like to own."
4,"I read this to my 2 and 4 year old girls, they just love it! I love that it's broken down by character qualities, so you can read stories that demonstrate honesty, for example. Great for reinforcing character in your children and we love the stories!"
4,"Not one of those books that you can't put down. The story once you get reading moves along pretty well, but it just lacks excitment. I would compare it to a gothic mystery maybe. I for one liked the soccer scenes, since I used to be a soccer parent. Anyway, this would probably be a good book to take on vacation or read on a stormy day."
4,"A book that you will cherish all the days of your life. I'm 29 and I read the book first in Junior high. Today I saw the cover and once again I entered a world that is full of struggle, sorrow, friendship and hope. The memories are that vivid! A must read if you can read."
4,"Adams shows a world not driven by greed, strife, and domination, but of hope, determination, and of life. These rabbits are an allusion of how an idealstic society should be where good triumphs over evil."
4,"I read this book years ago, but it is still one of my favorite books. If you have read this book and like it, (I don't think anyone would not like it!) I would suggest the Redwall seires to you, and also C. S. Lewis's Narnia and the Space Trilology. This book is for all ages, everyone would enjoy it!"
4,"This is probably the best book I have ever read in my life!! It has adventure suspense and excitement. Although I am only in fifth grade and I will read many,many more books this I predict this will be the best one. I have only read one of Richard Adams books but I know that he must be a creative genius.And can I just say to the person who said they got to page 3 and couldn't continue,you have to read just a tad farther with any book to get to a good part!"
4,"There is very little I can offer to the many heartfelt reviews of this classic, moving book. One thing I can suggest is that if you have children, encourage them to read it by their early teens. While they may not know it at the time, the experience of this novel will be a watermark in their adolescence that will stay with them through life. This book is magic, and subtle enough in its power to reach into our lives many years past the reading."
4,"I've read this book aloud three times over the last 12 years. When children get to about age 10, they are ready for the adventure of Watership Down. Pass along this treasure to your children. You will be glad you did."
4,"As always being an very avid bookworm, (even long before kindergarten) I hereby state that anyone who has not read or who doesn't own this superb novel should either be arrested or deemed to pay a very high fine!! (Lol! just kidding!) At 30 years of age, I remember vividly reading this novel as a freshman in high school for English on a mandatory basis. I was immediately spellbinded from start to finish. Gloriously written with the use of very picturesque words which ignite happiness, fear, and sorrow, this novel is truly indeed one that is not meant to be banned or ignored. Even though it illustrates life and the world as viewed from animalistic perception, please DO NOT immediately assume that it is a children's book! In reality, it is meant for anyone who is 12 years of age and over."
4,"When I first was given this book as summer reading, I didn't know what to think. It appeared to be, and was for about the first 100 pages, a rather dull book about rabbits. About the only thing I admired at first was the 'Lapine' language and the mythology which was a bit creative. The society of the rabbits was as would be expected- big means good. After they came to Cowslip's warren, things were interesting for a while, but then quickly became bogged down until they met Kehaar. After that the book was quite good, with the conclusion thrilling me. The authors descriptive powers were good, but at times tedious. Overall, I felt I was mistaken in my first opinion of the book and liked it."
4,"I was completely enchanted by this tale! I anticipated going through it to ultimately pass it on to my sister as something my niece might like. I think it might be a bit much for the little one for a few years but I am infinitely impressed by this story. It has been around for decades but this is my first encounter. I tried to explain to some of my bookish friends how taken I was by this story and they studied me with raised eyebrows, ""It's about rabbits? You want us to stop everything and read a story about rabbits?"" Well, yeah... It's not just about rabbits. It's about survival and love and taking a leap of faith. It's about friendship and sacrifice and believing that you deserve the best. It's about bravery, ingenuity, innovation, and testing your own limits. And, yeah, okay, it's also about rabbits. I loved it. I laughed, I cried, I held my breathe, I cried out. I can't wait until my niece is old enough."
4,I thought this book was awesome!! Towards the end Richard Adams actually succeeded in turning me into a rabbit. My heart was racing just like a bunny. I recommend this book to any age group. If you read it when you were younger read it again. It is a powerful story.
4,"This could possibly be my favorite book of all time. The characters in this were amazing and were portrayed as smart creatures, it being no fault of their own that they do not know certain things. The situations were almost humanlike, but it was better not about humans. Very good book, a must read. And when you have finished, you must read the sequal!"
4,"Watership Down is a very good book about a party of rabbits who run away from their warren to eascape danger. I enjoyed the literature exerpts at the beggining of each chapter. Watership Down has its own ""Lapine"" vocabulary. It was a bother to look in the Lapine glossary every time I came to a strange word but the story itself is great. Also, one or two of the chapters are long, boring, and don't make sense. The story is fairly long but fun to read and suspensful at some points. This story, however is ideal for classrooms to read. I'd reccomend this book to the sixth grade or seventh grade reader. Even with its small flaws, I loved the book."
4,Brims with invention on every page. Recommended to anyone interested in fiction. Buy it in hardcover it is a novel you will want to re-read.
4,"I have really enjoyed this book. If you are tired of scratching the surface of running in other books and want to know more about the different theories of chemical processes, theories on how your muscles work, how fatigue develops, significant figures in running history, and several different theories on training for various distances, this may be the book for you. Very thick read, something for everyone, but maybe too much for the novice. Almost a novel of academics for a college course. Great book. A must for a serioius runner's bookcase."
4,"The immense detail of Phanz is greatly refreshing. If anyone is interested in the detailed movements of each regiment, company, general, etc. of the second day of the battle of Gettysburg, then this is the book to get. This seems to be the best researched book that one could find on the subject. Also, Phanz does not ""take sides."" He is generally fair to both sides, not presenting either the North nor the South in unnecessarily bad light.This is the sort of book that we need more of. Phanz's immense scholarship and mastery of the battle enables one to be able to trust his judgement in interpretation and description."
4,20 words can not describe this dvd because my wife really enjoyed it so much it now has become a part of her library
4,"""Waiting: The True Confessions of a Waitress"" by Debra Ginsberg is a real treat. You're lucky enough to get inside the head of a wonderfully funny and creative woman. Her writings of life as a waitress are a real departure for a ""fiction"" reader like myself, and I enjoyed every minute of it. It was laugh out loud funny and so easy to identify with. I mean, we all visit restaurants and, probably have worked in food service at one point or another. I think it's a situation that many people can see themselves in. A great book, with a funny and witty take on life. I think you'll enjoy it!"
4,"""Waiting"" provides a glimpse into the life of those we often forget to see, or acknowledge...the people who serve us. If we are to be judged by the way we treat those who serve us, this book reveals us to be a pretty pathetic bunch! This is a engaging story of growing up and coming to terms with choices and circumstances. Debra Ginsberg has a real gift for storytelling. It also reinforced my belief in overtipping.....They do work hard for the money."
4,"All I can say is that if ever I questioned the universality of the ""waiting life"", I don't anymore. I have waited tables now for years as an easy way to get myself through school and everything Ginsberg talks about has happened to me and the various coworkers I have had over the years.Not only is it a way to laugh at your own follies in the business but also a guide to unskilled diners who think ""tipping is a city in china"" and that their servers are merely uneducated peons there to accept their personal abuses.I highly recommend this book as it is the only memoir I have ever seen that deals strictly with the trials of being a waitress. In short, it is a quick read and all around good fun. If I could afford it, I would buy a copy for every single person I work with. If you've ever waited tables to make ends meet, this book is a must!!!"
4,"Excellent descriptions. Waiters are so under-appreciated. She proves to the general public that waiters are human. My perspective was challeneged. She writes from acccounts that have changed her. Main theme: Waiting for life to ""really start"". Very Authentic, lots of growth. Fun gift for anyone who has ever waited tables."
4,The item was just as described and shipped on time. Recommended seller would buy from again without hesitation. Thank you!
4,"I don't regret paying for it. She went way too deep with her emotions and feelings, which was terribly boring. The rest of the book was entertaining. If you're into restaurant gossip and drauma you'll like it."
4,"After reading Waiting, unable to put it down, I loved it! I have been waiting and bartending for 10 years now at multiple establishments over the years and this book is ridiculously spot on in every way. It gives me someone else prospective and assures me that waiting tables really isn't such a bad job and I make far more money in less time then a ""real job"". Thank you so much Debra for such a fantastic read and uplifting view on something I have always thought was so inadequate!!"
4,"Most certainly, 'Amadeus' discovers the accolades it receives. It is a true classic and ingenious fusion of music, spectacle, intrigue, performance, and directorial vision. Please note that the new director's cut has about 30 mins. of added footage. Some of this footage includes a scene containing sex/nudity. For this, the timid souls of the MPAA served up a new 'R rating.' The original theatrical version was rated 'PG.' The added footage is a great highlight and does not diminish this phenomenal film, rather it enhances key plot points. 'Amadeus,' just like Mozart's music, is masterful and unique. See it, then see it again."
4,"It was interesting and entertaining. I would recommend it. I learned a lot about the composer and his life. The acting is wonderful. There are a few long drawn out scenes that are a bit boring, but overall it was great. The historical elements were especially interesting."
4,"I really have loved this movie for years. Now i had the chance to get it in HD.It just looks great on full HD. a bit grainy on some dark scenes but not to cry over it. love the colors, the music etc.. sadly enough my receiver is broken so i had to content myself with the osund coming out of the tv.But this is a must if you love classical music. This version comes with a cd containg music from the movie, a booklet with pics and actors biografy and a disc that will halp you get your digital copy for mobile stuff.Go buy it. you wont regret"
4,"I already knew the movie, but never had it on DVD.Excellent service, ease of order, and delivery."
4,The team owner wants to bring in ball playrs from all around the league as well as starting with a new staff of coaches tries to bring her team in last place. With the support of the coaches and vetern players the team started to gel quicker than expected. There are lots of laughs throughout the game. The announcer for the game keeps the laughs coming over and over. This movie is really a great for the sports fan in you.
4,"This is more a nostalgia note than a review, but most of this movie was filmed over one summer in Milwaukee (maybe Cleveland wasn't blue-collar enough). All the baseball action scenes were filmed in County Stadium, which is now a big parking lot for Miller Park. The crew invited locals to the filming at the Stadium and other locations about town, so it has a lot of local flavor. I went to the filming of the big finale to be part of the ""rabid"" crowd so I'm in this move, kind of. It's fun to see Uecker do his stuff, and Pete Vukovich, a former Brewer pitcher, is perfect as Heywood, the Yankee nemesis.People from out of town said County Stadium was a dog of a ballyard, but look for the scene when Berenger sneaks onto the field at night alone and pretends to hit one out. It sure looks pretty, and I miss it."
4,My DVD arrived very quickly. The packaging was in excellent condition. Then DVD itself was in excellent condition too. Great service all around.
4,Great movie and great price! It's wonderful to be able to download it on your Kindle and watch it when you are ready to.
4,"There's a red moon a rising...This is the greatest movie ever. Quick delivery/quality product. I was going to write more but I got to think about it. Let me get back to you will ya, I got a guy on the other line about some white walls."
4,"Turtledove's alternative history, based on the premise that the Spanish Armada managed to conquer England in 15888, is a treat for anyone who loves Shakespeare. His grasp of historical minutiae, of Elizabethan language, of Shakespeare's (and Lope de Vega's) work, and of human nature makes this novel entertaining beyond even my dreams. Unlike some of Turtledove's novels, in which his characters are chatty to the point of becoming trivial, Ruled Brittania has a driving discipline that keeps a remarkably complex plot and cast of characters in constant forward motion to a climax that is not a foregone conclusion. This is the best of his books that I've read so far."
4,"Right off the bat, the following tracks are gems:- Flesh and Blood- Possibilities- Slide AwayDefinitely worth a purchase for these tracks alone."
4,"This was part of our wedding registry, and I am so glad that I got it to go with the food processer. It's so much better to have a switch-out ensemble instead of yet another appliance.It's better than a stand alone juicer, and my juice always comes out cold and fresh.Some advice for this item:I did find that for cleaning, the thing that works the best is a bottle brush, the kind with the sponge at the end, and you clean going with the blades, so you don't shred your sponge. It also gets all the pulp out of the mesh.I also found that feeding the items in slowly, and then letting it run for a couple of minutes gets out the max amount of juice. If you have any smaller add-in's like ginger, you have to put it through first so that the flavor doesn't get lost in the build up of pulp. A silicone spatula works really well for scooping out the stuff that's left behind as well."
4,"I don't know how I survived without this machine. I use it every day, both the large and mini bowls. It's simple to use and a breeze to clean. The blade storage box is also very handy."
4,Just as I remembered. This brings back soooo many memories of my youngest son who is now 27!We had so much fun playing this game!!
4,"this is a piece of plastic that is cut to fit the Kitchenaid food processor discs. So, it holds them perfectly, on the wall or in the cabinet."
4,"Three Easy Pieces is a truly remarkable album for those all-too-familiar with Buffalo Tom, as well as those new to the band. Incredibly catchy, this is the album that I've been waiting for in today's overly saturated pop and hip-hop musical landscape. It is not a retread of the band's work from the 90's--althought BT's patented sound does shine through in many of the songs--but is rather a fresh, relevant collection of alternative rock less obsessed with sounding ""radio-ready"" and more committed to sounding timeless (at least as far as Buffalo Tom fans should be concerned). It is the perfect combination of old and new and is utterly impossible to avoid once the ""play"" button is pushed. Give it a listen. Come to think of it, give it a few listens."
4,Smokey Robinson&The Miracles have it going on here with there soulful sounds&vibes.this is a Good solid album that showcases not only the Miracles but of course Smokey Robinson who is often overlooked as the Great Artist that He is.worth checking into.
4,So far it seems to be just as described. It has not worn at all and even though I was worried it may be brittle dropping it has not resulted in anything negative.
4,"It contains much of the basic 12 Steps, but puts a different spin on them. It provides a closeness to Christian ideas, but this is tastefully done."
4,"At our preschool, we love this version of Stone Soup. 1 teacher plays the old lady, 1 teacher plays the young boy and 1 teacher is the reader. The children love it when we act out this book.....""Fancy that""! Next thing you know...the children are acting out the story on the playground."
4,"For years, I have used a matarello and hand-cranked pasta machine. This automatic set is wonderful, fast and so easy. Should have invested in it years ago."
4,The product looks as I expected it to. I haven't had the opportunity to make pasta with it yet and I won't have an idea of how good the set of attachments is until I've made pasta about 10 or more times with each component. Ask me again in about 1 year and I may have some news for you.
4,I have been making pasta everyday now because it's so easy to use and amazing ! life savor ! does everything for you. Easy to clean. Easy to use. Love kitchen aid appliances !
4,The roller makes rolling thin homemade pasta sheets easy. The cutters provide uniform wide or narrow pasta. Its great to be able to use your own homemade recipes.
4,"I could not wait to use my pasta roller and attachments. I have always cut my noodles by hand and, wow what a difference these made. They knead and cut quickly and cut my time by at least 1/2. I have also used the pasta roller to roll out fondant and it worked great! I would highly recommend this set."
4,NASCAR For Dummies (For Dummies (Sports & Hobbies))Contains everything NASCAR fans needs to know and then some!Recommend to all NASCAR addicts!
4,This book helped me soooooooooo much! Like Mark says in the into this book is not for dummies only it's for everyone! I highly recommed this book!!!!!! Five stars all the way!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,"Good sound, nice design, nice neoprene cover...Negative aspect: pressing the ffwd or rew button on the remote control does not change the video that is currently being reproduced."
4,This is one of the best movies Ive seen even though its a foreign filmbut the guy (Amitabh Bachan) is my childhood hero would order more in the future
4,"This is a fantastic collection of seven episodes of the Colgate Comedy Hour featuring Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. The telecast, with Dean and Jerry as hosts, ran from around 1951-1954. This collection is filled with several funny skits and memorable songs, as well as a stellar supporting cast of classicHollywood film stars. We are also treated to vintage Colgate commercials, as these specials are left entirely intact.As a bonus the duos classic ""At War with the Army"" is features on disc one, and disc five finds ""At the Movies with Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis"", where several of the comedy teams sixteen feature films are featured using the original (or re-release) trailers.In short, this collection is a great start to what will hopefully lead to Dean and Jerry's entire cinematic catalog being released to DVD, as well as that of comedian Jerry Lewis's entire solo career.A treasure for any fan of the duo, or a lover of good entertainment."
4,"I've really appreciated how well this hand mixer handles heavy cookie dough. It does the job as well as my KitchenAid stand mixer, and is much easier to take out, use, clean and put away."
4,I love this mixer. ... I make cut-out cookies on a regular basis and the mixer I had was not adequate...I had to hand mix the flour into the batter...Not with this mixer. No need to worry about getting my hands dirty. I have also used the dough hooks for making bread and was very pleased. I would highly recommend this mixer to anyone. ...
4,"I canned eight gallons of applesauce without having to take this product apart and clean it. That is a big deal for me, what a time saver. Everything else I have used usually clogs up, and I have to stop to clean it out.It left all the good stuff in, and the core and seeds were discarded as dry as can be. NO WASTE!"
4,That attachment is a wonderful addition to my Kitchen Aid.I make LOTS of homemade jam and for Blackberries and Black Raspberries and Red Raspberries--------------It is a miracle !!!
4,Another Step by Kim Wilde quality is amazing while sounding vibrant. Comparing the new sound to my original old album the sounds is so flat. Hope they do something about Kim's remaining releses between 1990-1994 soon to be re-issued because they bore the hell out of me their so FLAT. I regreted buying those 1990-1994 used Cd's 2yrs. ago. I don't listen to them anymore.Reviewed by Desiree LaVey
4,"I haven't actually used this yet, but my Mom got it for me for Christmas. I have been using a large Pyrex bowl under my mixer bowl (I have the lift-type mixer), and filling that with ice water. It works OK, but getting it out is VERY messy! I am so looking forward to using the actual water-jacket that is made for the mixer!!"
4,"The black lacquer ballpoint and rollerball set by Aldo Domani were a great gift for my nephew's graduation. He loves them & they were an excellant looking gift for a price that was a steal! I believe I paid around $19.99 for them & they came in a beautiful box, were excellant looking themselves & pleased my nephew to no end since he'll use them in college & they make him feel very professional. I would highly recommend them to anyone."
4,"Pros:Lot of nice features and cheap additional softwareGood form factor and designFlash ROM keeps all your data safe even when fully discharged.Handwriting recognization software is much better than GraffitiNice Mp3 player.Cons:Doesn't use TFT LCD, Passive matrix LCD is slightly sluggishVery poor documentationIt is a very nice PDA with tons of good features and Additional software, most of them under 10$. If you read carefully you find, this PDA doesn't use Microsoft Pocket PC and uses Casio's own version of Window CE, so you cannot use the goodies from Microsoft like Pocket Word, Pocket Excel and Street. But other wise the third party software are quite nice you dont feel the need for Microsoft Pocket Suite.The color screen is good enough to view 220x260, true color pictures crisp. It has enough of space to store a lot of addresses, pictures and even a small home video !!!"
4,"One word folks...KITCHENAID! I am a Kitchenaid junkie and this hand mixer lives up to the name! I picked it because it has 9 speeds and I am glad I did. It is nice to go up gradually when I want to kick it up into high gear to avoid getting splatters. I have mixed many batches of egg whites and I can honestly say that each time this mixer performed like a champ! Even though it is a little expensive compared to other models, it is WELL worth the price!!!"
4,"Once again Patrick O'Brian at his very best, This book is best read as part of the Aubrey/maturin adventures, This book is fourth in the series, of 21 books, I have grown to enjoy his style of writeing, his attention to detail of the running of a naval ship at the turn of the 1800's the life on board, the detail of life as it was, the social, you get very involved in their lives. This series of adventures, is the best I have come across and patrick O'Brian, pens it to perfection"
4,"Weird mixture of hilarious, historically based, way too real. Picked one up on tape to stay awake during a couple of hours' trip, have both read and listened to them ever since.Fortunately there really are twenty-some in the series. And the tone of them varies, one with world's silliest ending, one that just made me sad. This one is pretty big on military history (the names have been changed to suit the series!)."
4,"Exactly what I thought it would be. Attached easily, performed as needed, and washed up well. Overall: It does what it is supposed to!"
4,Bought the mixer so I thought I would make some Sausages works very good also price was again excellent compared to Australia
4,"Welcome. The Polyphonic Spree is a 24 piece vocal symphonic band from Dallas TX. Headed up by former Tripping Daisy front man Tim Delaughter, and inspired by the sounds of Sgt. Pepper and Pet Sounds, the music is unlike anything your ears have had the pleasure of enjoying before. TogetherTogether were heavy, the group's sophomore release, and picks up right where The Beginning Stages Of left off. The first album, (Originally just a demo) focused on many of the individual instruments in the band. TWH is much more piano based, and it's quite clear that the band has matured into a cemented sound that is truly unique and a treat to enjoy.It's a concept album in many ways, and even echoes refrains from the first album. I strongly recommend hearing the albums back to back, to enjoy the ""full circle"" effect.Quite possibly, the finest album I have ever heard. Give em a spin...get infected...get addicted! [...]"
4,"Oswarl Chambers has, without a doubt, a special way of putting together a daily devotion that makes the reader really thing about their walk with our Lord Jesus Christ and our communication with God. I would recmmend it to anyone."
4,This book has the time tested truth that only someone that has walked closely with the Lord could know. You will read this book for the rest of your life!
4,This work has survived time and never dated. In fact it probably gets better with age as so much similar material becomes watered down and basic. It is a rare day that I don't get something of great benefit from this book.
4,"Most devotionals are pretty tame. Oswald Chambers is not! Are you ready to THINK??? Are you prepared to examine attitudes; actions; previous teaching?? If so, you are in for a real treat with Oswald Chambers ""My Utmost for His Highest""."
4,"I don't believe all readers would share the response I had, and this would be a shame, for rarely have I been so moved. This contains poems, short prose and stories- Some are beautiful parables, some are narratives of his past, others include gentle condemnations of harmful passions or yearnings for a better world; all (excluding, perhaps, the letters) are worth reading for any sort of audience, revolutionary or romantic, religious or humanist, idiot or intelligent, and so on.Some parts of this book seemed unreal. So wonderous was the flow of words and the manifestation of Gibrans mind that I felt tears at the incredible beauty of the whole, I even shuddered in joy brought about by the realisation that this work of art exists- kind of like when first reading the Brothers Karamazov, seeing a Michaelangelo, or viewing a spectacular film of nature (Blue Planet, Pattagonia and the like); one is left in awe."
4,"Heinberg's ""The Party's Over"" presents a thorough, understandable, and logical discussion of the history of the petroleum industry and what we need to do about the growing crisis. He paints a pretty dim picture, but also provides a list of potentially mitigating measures that individuals, groups, and decision-makers might -- and indeed must -- do to avert a situation that will quickly grow out of our control unless we act now. This book should be widely read and discussed, NOW."
4,"great read if you are interested in whats going to happen after oil runs out, everyone should read"
4,This product is great for shredding cheese. We eat a lot of cheese pizzas (homemade) in our house as a family of 5 and prefer the price and taste of blocks of cheese than pre-shredded. You can shred a huge block in a matter of seconds. I like to place my cheese in the freezer for about 5-10 minutes before shredding- works much better that way.
4,"If you're connected with God and have accepted Jesus in your life, this book is a confirmation of what you believe. If you're reading to find answers, this book will open your eyes to truth."
4,"It has given me a beautiful perspective on how God created woman. He explains in details the significance of our strength, beauty and spirit of love. Very well written."
4,This book has changed my life and the way i think about God's love for me! I feel loved in a way that is only satisfied by God.
4,"I read Wild at Heart when it first came out and it had a major impact on my life and allowed me to see my then boyfriend in a different light. I was able to see him as God saw him and am now married to him and we're having a daughter. Knowing I was having a girl is what made me buy Captivating (Wild at Heart for Women), because I want my daughter to grow up with the right messages and a healthy self-image. I was at first afraid it would be too much repeat of Wild at Hear and that I wouldn't get that much new insight out of it.It has helped me accept myself and my God-infused identity as his daughter. It has made me excited about having a daughter and helping her to grow as a woman of made in God's image - the crown of creation. I'm so grateful for the content and honesty of this book."
4,"There is a time and season for everything in our lives. According to what season you are in your life will determine how you relate to this book. Just like the bible, certain stories and messages are more meaningful to you because it relates to what you're going through. This book is for any woman who feels alone, undesired, or hurt (single or married). Captivating shows you how God desires you. It reveals the venerable side to every woman's heart. If this is something you are not seeking (at this time) then it will not appeal to you. But at that moment or season when you feel alone or abandon and you want to understand the why's, when's and how's of your heart's desires then allow this book to be an instrument of God's undying love for you."
4,"This book is great for every woman, girl, and men who want to understand them. It not often you read a book about what a woman truly is according to the word of God. It amazing to see that we woman have the same nature of God and when she explains it, it makes you so proud to be a woman. The love of God for woman is evident throughout every page. This book tears down all the lies of how the world defines woman and reveals the truth! A must read!! Every female should have this book!"
4,"There have been controversies in Christian circles about the authors of this book. Don't let that scare you away. I read it and felt immediately that God is using these precious people as tools to reach wounded souls. How could they know I was feeling exactly like that and hurting in exactly those ways?What an excellent gift for the women you know and love. They struggle with many of the same thoughts as they strive to find a balance between the false messages the world offers, and the misguided messages the church often offers women to combat the lies the world sells. Women are often stuck in the middle wondering what does God really want me to do.He wants you to know YOU ARE TRUELY CAPTIVATING... Because HE is Captivating."
4,"I bought this product for my second subwoofer built, the mayor reason was for esthetics. But what I found is that this tube is simply amazing, besides the esthetics, it give you total control of the right port length for the desired tuned frequency, you can start testing with the full factory length and the go down to the calculated length, before glue the ends. The flared ends give better air flow and wave dispersion. The SW built was cube shaped .75 cu ft, down fired 8"" driver with 70 watts amp. I'm really satisfied with the results."
4,"This crossing can't be used on a curve; however, I was able to get use from it on my layout. It is very basic with a low price. You might consider Bachmann's actuated RR Xing if your crossing is on a straight section of track. I used one on an N Scale layout and it worked beautifully."
4,"I recently picked up this cd at a local store in Denver just to try it out. Although there were some interesting choices of repertoire and musicians (leading off with Wanda and Stephanie didn't exactly encourage me to continue listening!) I was pleasantly surprised at the mix of musical styles and overall level of playing. I particularly enjoyed ""Zivio Slovenci"" by The Al Meixner Trio- which had a unique blend of a driving Cleveland- Slovenian beat, solid accordion work and tight 3 part harmonies.... If there are any other CDs out by this group in specific I'd definitely recommend checking them out... Besides that John Gora and Gorale, the Polka Quads and Eric Knoltkamper turn in some great contemporary American polka performances, next to classic cuts by Happy Louie and Markic and Zagger."
4,This is great the only problem with this is the movies come in cheap cardboard seperaters. other than that its great for the kids cuz the digital copies come in handy when were at the doctor's office or on a long road trip....
4,Fast shipping. Perfect condition. Purchased as replacements for scratched dvds plus toy story 3. Won't use the blurays or digital copies but I couldn't be more satisfied with the set.
4,excellent collectors item. Best price was on Amazon. The toy box carrying the movies can be a little more sturdy but other than that no complaints.
4,"I decided to make fresh orange juice this year and chose this attachment over the counter hand thing my grandmother used. I love it. It does make the kitchenaid make a groan noise when you are pressing to get all the juice out of the orange, but, it does get all the juice out and quickly and it was not messy at all. I did place a bowl upside down and then placed the bowl I was putting the juice in on top of that bowl - so, there was not any distance from the juicer to the bowl - as some of the reviews had said how messy it was - but, I did not find it messy at all - rather easy to use and a breeze to clean up. I did 10 oranges - cut in half and had to empty the drainer 4 times - for the pulp and seeds, but, that was not hard to do as I had placed the trash beside me so, I tried to be as prepared as I could be and had no problems."
4,"I rate the attachment 5 stars because it attaches well to the mixer unit, turns as it should, and washes easily.Now for some objective comments...1. Effort is still required to squeeze the citrus fruit onto the spinning juicer arc.2. It still takes awhile to get juice for a breakfast of 4--if there's time savings to be had with this device, it's not as great as you may think.3. OJ is quick, but large grapefruit take time, especially if you are straining a lot to remove pulp."
4,"Have only used it for orange juice so far, so can not comment yet about grapefruit or citrus, but so far, so good. I especially like that it is high enough off the counter so that I can use a full sized pitcher to collect the juice, however as noted in other reviews, the strainer is small and needs to be cleaned often, so using a larger external strainer over the pitcher saves time. I selected this over a stand alone juicer to save counter and or storage space,it was priced a bit lower with BB&B 20% off coupon, you can easily juice directly into a full sized pitcher, and as an attachment it makes my mixer even more useful and an even better investment."
4,"I have used various hand and electric juicers in the past, and none has worked any better than this one. It is a bit noisy and the supplied pulp filter needs to be supplemented with a secondary filter after squeezing. This is more than offset by ease of use and cleaning.If you already own/are planning on buying a kitchen aid stand mixer and you squeeze citrus, this is a very worthwhile investment."
4,"I've used the juicer attachment for years and love it except for the comments about the strainer being too small. A strainer with an extended pulp reservoir out the front would help, if it didn't get in the way. The extension would have a solid bottom and be ribbed so that the pulp could be pushed forward with a teaspoon to drain, thus extending the time between pulp dumps. Also, the comment about shaft wear/squeaking are valid. I have a small tube of food-service-grade grease I use on the shaft: never even thought about shortening. Very clever! Also, different-size reams for limes to grapefruit would be a nice way to sell more stuff! One more thing, K-A: how about a nice low-speed coffee grinder attachment? Mine would live attached to the mixer, as I use my Krups grinder every day, and could use the counter space. Maybe an ice crusher/shaver, too!"
4,"KitchenAid JE Citrus Juicer Stand Mixer AttachmentI greased the shaft with butter as suggested earlier and made short work of two bags of lemons that were as big as grapefruits from my uncle's tree in Indio, CA.I didn't use the included strainer but a sieve over the mouth of a large bowl instead. Worked just fine to keep the seeds and pulp out of the juice. I couldn't get the juice to run down my arm as others report experiencing, so I don't understand how it can be a problem.As a comparison, last year I bought a DeLonghi Citrus Juicer and the motor burned out before I juiced one grocery bag of lemons.I'd have to say that this KitchenAid attachment is every bit as good at the mixer I use it with."
4,"Maybe it was my frame of mind, but I found A SOUND OF THUNDER an entertaining time travel movie. I don't think the special fx were that horrible; they were appropriate to me. The premise of this type of time travel is interesting and the ultimate de-evolution kind of spooky. I like Edward Burns; he's not the world's greatest actor but he has a kind of ""commonality"" which makes him good for the sort of everyman hero he plays here. Ben Kingsley does well too as the money-mad man behind the time travel company, and Catherine McCormack's fine as the female lead. Time travel movies always have the potential to make errors and this one is no exception, but I found it enjoyable."
4,"I like different twists on 'time travel' Science Fiction, and this is definitely 'different'. Here, a corporation uses a time travel machine for financial gain (not such a surprise), but when they upset the balance and cause 'time waves', things go to hell quickly. The creatures that 'might have been' are an interesting flip on evolution. Not the best nor unique that I've seen, but very entertaining and a delight to watch. I would've liked them to expand on the 'strange creature' evolution theory, and felt they had plenty of room in the film to do so, but I don't believe Sci-Fi fans will be disappointed in what they came up with. It's also not full of blood and guts, so I felt comfortable allowing my juvenile son to watch.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
4,"We've only used it a few times, but this mixer seems to perform well. The lowest speed is slow enough so you can work your way up to a faster speed without sending your ingedients flying all over the kitchen. The beaters are stronger than they look, and are much easier to scrap clean than flat beaters. As long as it holds up over the years, I think this mixer is a good buy."
4,"This is a good buy, expecially when trying to save space. My friend has a ""professional"" grinder that he bought at an outdoorsman store and this works just as well for a fraction of the cost and takes up very little space during storage. The pusher for the meat is a little smaller than the hole so the meat has a tendancy to come back up when pushing through for the final grind. I have the sausage attachment as well and it is great."
4,"We have now had the food grinder for about a month. We LOVE IT! I don't even plan on using it for meat, so the reviews I saw about the metal shavings did not concern me. We use ours to process vegetables. Zuchini, peppers, onion, pickels, etc. Also for shredded cheese! We have canned over 100 quarts this summer with no problems at all, no metal, or anything going bad. I do recommend not pushing hard on the food feeder, or the juices will get you. Also, don't use past medium speed. Juices spray. I love this addition to my stand mixer!"
4,The price was excellent at 30% below retail. Delivery was quick. We've used it to grind venison and chicken and it does a great job. Easy to clean too.
4,Works real well. You have to make sure the grinder blade is all the ways into the slots. We ground even chicken and it worked great.
4,"We just tried our meat grinder and following the previous reviewers suggestions cut the pork into strips and partialy froze the pork. No problem grinding with the large holes the first time, however when we passed the pork through a second time it took significantly longer. The plunger is not very effiecent, the groud pork kept coming up the sides of the plunger and we had to keep pushing it down, this was very tedious and time consuming! The plunger does not fit the hopper and we had a very hard time. Any sugestions would be appreciated."
4,"This is a great product to own. No more will my family buy ground beef when we can get roasts on sale and grind the meat ourselves. We love the two options of coarse or regular grounds as we can use the first own for making chili. The meat is so lean that there is minimal cooking time so keep that in mind. Clean up is quick and easy. While you can put all items in the dishwasher, I handwashed them as there are two steel gears that could get easily lost in the dishwasher. I highly recommend this product. You will know and see the quality of meat you are serving your family."
4,Bought this because of the pink slime added to hamburger! Home ground meat is so much better. Now I know what goes in my ground beef!
4,"This unit is well constructed, has a motor powerful enough to do a superior job of grinding without overheating. Clean-up is easy."
4,"How to Enhance Your Husband's Retirement, from Keeping Up Appearances is yet another hilarious adventure of Hyacinth and Richard Bucket! The two begin their retirement by ""yachting"", at the insistence of Hyacinth. Of course, little did they know, their ""outing"" turns into disaster as usual. Compared to the other episodes of Keeping Up Appearances, this one will guarantee to make you laugh and chuckle! A must see!"
4,never got this one before have read the lensman and skylark but never got this one....great book love all his books
4,I bought this CD to go with Funk Classics: 70's 2. The music will definitely get the party going. If you love Funk/ R&B you will love this CD.
4,"I just bought my S710a and all I can say is WOW! Its eveything I had hoped for and plenty more. The phone's outter shell looks and feels great. It doesnt have that certain, cheap plastic feel unlike other phones like the Nokia 7610 which is a complete joke. The S710a has an absolutely gorgeous screen and the digital camera actually takes pretty decent pictures unlike all other picture camera phones that litterally look like junk. I highly recommend the S710a to anyone who's looking for a full-featured cell phone in a good lookin' outter shell. Definately worth the money unlike other high dollar phones like the Moto Razr which is another joke. The S710a from Sony Ericsson was well worth the wait."
4,"Not so lush as the following full-length releases, still a beautiful piece of pop reminiscent of some Apples in Stereo work. Songwriting was not as accomplished as works immediately following, but still superior to 99% of the players in the field. Certainly worth the purchase price."
4,"What can I say? It is a true classic. At the age of 72, this is my third reading. I enjoyed it as much this time as I did the other two."
4,My class read this wonderful classic and I was among the few of loving it. I think Mark Twain did a wonderful job of portraying each character.
4,Engages reader. Compelling and very interesting story with a good plot! I'd definately recommend it to anyone in need of a good book. Read this book!
4,"Tom Sawyer is a book about a boy who loves to have fun. Therefore, I would reccomend this book to kids from 9-14 years old, because it's about kids who love to run, play, and get into mischief.This book will get you off your chair and make you want to dance!This book begins while whitewashing a fence and tricking his friends to do it for him. While the story of THE REAL Tom is unraviling the story of love with Becky Thatcher is also. Among that the scary story of Injun Joe, a crook,liar,and a spooky man appears. This book is an extravigant, thrilling tale!I learned a lot from this novel. I learned that back then kids could be kids, and now a 12 yr. old has to act like a 25 yr. old. I also learned that some people just need to let loose, and have some fun! I am extremely glad that our class read Tom Sawyer!"
4,It's cool it has adventure and action even a bit of romance too! Random words random words to meet repuirements
4,Excellent classic tween-teen read. Required for most middle and early high school English literary requirements. Some kids find it easier to read aloud in order to master the dialect cadence.
4,"listen; Buy this beast! Beans all day! hard winter wheat all day! Both together, all day! lol it is that awesome.....flour is a bit warm coming out, fyi."
4,"The KitchenAid Classic mixer is fantastic!!! its so easy to change attachments and clean. I was worried buying this because i live in Australia, but the postage was quick and the packaging was secure. Because of the voltage difference i also bought a transformer to change the voltage so it works with no problems. So anyone thinking of buying this mixer i would highly recommend :)"
4,"I love to cook - but have always done so much by hand. But what changed my mind was, I took a cooking class on making homemade pasta. And boy does this machine save you tons of time! Since I've purchased it - I've whipped potatoes, made cookies and of course bought the attachments to make my own pasta.I opted not to by the pricer version with the; splash shield and the handle ont he bowl... The additional costs just didn't seem right for two such small items. So far, I'm not missing them!"
4,I'm a big Nora Roberts fan and I've enjoyed the Garden Trilogy for its characters and their relationships as well as the mystery of the ghost. This last book has more scenes with the ghost and keeps you in anticipation. A fun read!
4,"book in excellent condition, almost looks like nobody read it yet. good value for the money. loved shopping this way. i plan to do it again."
4,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect from this book so when I started flipping through the pages, it became clear to me that it's basically a dictionary of paranormal terms. Sylvia explains what's real and what's fake in the only way she can. As always, she simplifies things so that anybody can understand what she's talking about. It's a good read as usual (if you enjoy her books that is) but unlike other books, this isn't really talking about her experiences for the most part because like I said, it reminds me of a dictionary of terms that you could refer back to should you be reading a different paranmormal book and can't quite remember what a term means."
4,"I'll admit I am a fan of Sylvia Browne. This is one of my favorite books by her. This was published a while ago, if you read it now, you will find that some of the things she has predicted already have come true."
4,"Ok, I just recently received and used this new widget, so it may be too early to tell but my initial quality report is quite promising. The opener is well made and locks in place like other attachment on my Kitchen-Aid Pro 600 stand mixer. The recommended speed for cans is number two and it turns, opens and peels off without any barbs. Those who reported that barbs are present is likely a random quality or tolerance issue. I know from experience from my hand-held opener, that over time the cutting disc wears out and thus' barbs occur on the can. If it last for 18-months or more I'll be happy. Anyway, at roughly 28 bucks, it's a pretty cool device.Regards,Digital Dude"
4,"It sticks out somewhat and isn't a pretty sight on my black mixer, but works great! We take it off when not in use. I'm glad I bought it though."
4,The Foot Book: Dr. Seuss's Wacky Book of Opposites (Bright & Early Board Books(TM))Fun and silly Dr. Seuss book that makes teaching fun
4,"This book covers the Tampa/St. Petersburg area like no other guide book I've read. It's well-organized; whatever I was looking for - restaurant, attractions - was easy to find. Additionally, I enjoyed the insights and odd tidbits about the area. The maps were especially helpful and easy to use. Highly recommended!"
4,"THis item was ordered as a possible gift but I ordered with confidence as I have used my own K.A. pouring shield for a number of years. Yea, pouring shield."
4,"This is one of the most comprehensive and well written books on the mystical path, which is the core of the religious/spiritual experience. Huxley unites all the world's traditions offering the intrinsic philosophy underlying all paths to God. I humbly recommend this book to anyone seeking an understanding of the sometimes hidden truth in religion."
4,"We've only used the meat grinder, not the pasta attachment yet. So far, so good."
4,"A nice set of creme brulee pans. Very sturdy, clean well, better price than I could fins anywhere else, in-store or online."
4,"This book changed my life. I was given a copy while in high school in the mountains of colorado. I was, and continue to be, inpired by this book. My days and nights under the open sky of the west have filled my life with joy - and this book helped get me out there after growing up a city boy in california. Buy it, read it, and give copies to everyone you know."
4,I purchased this bowl as an extra for my daughters Kitchen Aid. I bought the mixer for her from Amazon 2 years ago and she is now a culinary whiz! We both love Kitchen Aid and Amazon equally...We don't shop anywhere else!!
4,I wanted covers for my kitchenaid because it is just easier than using foil or plastic wrap. I love this product. I have a 4 1/2 qt bowl and it fits perfectly. I wish the hole in the middle wasn't so deep (it pops out downward). Not sure what it is for. But the lids works for what I need.
4,"Before I start, I did see this movie with a bunch of friends, so that might have helped.As far as ""movies"" are concerned, I'm not sure this is a movie. It has no plot. The characters are there just to move the gags along. And it's disgusting.However, when I rented the movie, I was prepared for all of this. In order to enjoy The Meaning Of Life, you have to know that this movie is not a movie. I see it simply as a handful of ingenious SNL skits, and how ingenious these skits are. You'll be laughing your head off."
4,"I am a Monty Python fan and this IS a classic but...I'm still not fully satisfied. There are some parts where you just crack up such as ""The Machine that Goes Bing!"", ""Conversation Dinner"", ""Every Sperm is Holy,"" and ""Heaven."" But I have to say, half through my interest was totally lost. I had to tell myself,""This is Monty Python, you love Monty Python."" There some really outrageous great parts, it's just you have to wait for them and REALLY like Monty Python. So, just letting you know."
4,"ONE OF ALL-TIME FUNNIEST MOVIES IN THE GALAXY. NAILS THE CATHOLICS, THEN THE PROTESTANTS, AND THAT'S JUST FOR STARTERS. NOTHING AND NO ONE IS SACRED. A LESSON IN SARCASM, OR AS MARGE SIMPSON WOULD SAY, 'VERY NICE.' HAVE FUN!"
4,"It is a very good movie, I like the every sperm song and the machine that goes ""ping"" but the best bit is fat man that pigs out in a posh restrant eats a wafer fin peice of meat and exsplodes this is a must see!"
4,"This is the best Monty Python film that they never actually made. It's funny from beginning to end, and the songs are easy to learn and, therefore, easy to impress your friends with tales of sacred sperm and other such delights. If you have ever laughed at Python humour then you should buy this dvd. . . it will not leave your player (except when it needs the toilet)."
4,"I really loved this CD. It is probably the first CD that I listened to from beginning till the end without skipping songs. I believe that this is a fantastic move by the church to promote itself to the younger audience. The CD has a very international style with visible influences from the middle east, africa, and europe. Go out and buy it."
4,This KitchenAid bowl w/handle is a must have with any kitchenAid mixer period. My wife loves it!
4,"I just received the extra bowl and it will come in handy when I make cookies, pies, and meat balls, etc. I like having a handle to hold on to. It sure is nice and shiny. I would recommend purchasing the extra bowl to others."
4,"Kitchen Aids are one of the best mixers you can buy - but initially when you purchase one you only get one bowl. This extra bowl fits the standard mixer, and is great because it even comes with a handle that is extremely helpful and convenient. If you are like me and searching for an extra bowl to go with your great mixer this is the purchase for you."
4,"This is a very nice bowl. It works perfectly with my Artisan mixer. Very fast shipping with Amazon Prime and it was well packaged, not damaged at all. Great bowl for the money :-)"
4,"I have needed an extra mixing bowl for ages but couldn't justify the $50 price tag so when I spotted it here for $30, that was a good incentive to get one. Sure makes things easier when you don't have to transfer ingredients and wash the bowl in the middle of mixing a receipe."
4,"My husband gave me the KitchenAid Mixer and Grain Mill for Christmas. I used the mill this morning to make pancakes and was really impressed. I followed the suggestion of others and in the mixer manual, and used the #2 setting on the mixer. It did a beautiful job of grinding the flour! The motor was warm when I was done, but no problems overheating. The flour was finely ground, too. I've eaten whole wheat pancakes before (store bought whole wheat flour) and wasn't impressed, so I wasn't too sure I'd like them. The ones I made with my freshly ground organic flour were amazing! The flavor was so good - I'll never go back to store bought flour again! It was good knowing I was providing wholesome food for my family. For home use, this is a great mill for the money!"
4,Not a lick of problems. We ground some berries and made some great bread. I recomend this to all!
4,Had a hard time finding these bulbs. Was glad to find them here and got them in a hurry. Very satisfied.
4,"As with Spin Selling (Neil Rackham), it's pretty heavy reading, and contradicts a lot of old style selling techniques,so I am yet to see if it works well. But I do admit that selling has changed a lot over the years, and it could be worthwhile advice !"
4,"I am amazed by today's technology!! I am 36 years old (as I write this), and have grown up with the Original video game systems; The Odyssey; The Intellivision; Coleco Vision; Nintendo; Super Nintendo; Sega Dreamcast; Playstation; Playstation 2; Xbox. Nintendo Gameboy; Sega Game Gear; Nintendo Gameboy Color; Nintendo Gameboy Advance; Nintendo GBA SP; Nintendo GBA DS; PSP.As you can see from my list, video games, and graphics have become awesomely advanced over time. And now, with today's systems such as the PSP and the GBA we can sit back and enjoy a good movie!!Shark Tale. Rated PG for some mild language and crude humor.Starring the voice talents of Will Smith, Robert De Niro, Renee'Zellweger, Jack Black, Angelina Jolie, Martin Scorsese, Ziggy Marley, Doug E. Doug.

4,This product has actually increased my quality of sleep. It is ultra comfortable and very good with regards to health. It was also cheaper than most other similar products. The pillow wasn't useful though. But then it was free.. So..
4,"I bought this ring as a present for valentines day for my girlfriend. I was a little worried about ordering a ring off of the internet for two reasons. One I was worried about the overall quality of the ring matching the picture, which it did. The other being if the size was not correct how would the customer assistance be and it was GREAT. The ring was great quality it was more on the petite side which I like. My girlfriend could not be happier with it. She has problems with nickel based jewelry and it is, like they state nickel-free. I got the size right, twice and they could not have been more helpful in fixing this error they not only sent me a new one quickly and were more then helpful making sure I got exactly what I had wanted. Thank you Taos."
4,"Ordered it for my girlfriend. It came quickly and is very pretty compared to other claddagh rings I have seen. Everything is just in perfect proportion to each other. The shine has faded a bit since I got it three months ago... but it's still loved.EDIT: My girlfriend at the time ended up getting one for me as well (we are both female). We aren't together anymore, but it's been years and it still looks great. I wear it very often. The only thing that shows poor quality is that the band has kind of bent into an oval shape (I guess to form-fit to my finger). It's very comfortable and well worth the money."
4,"Simply stated, these are well made and a great value to protect against key holing. I expect that they will last forever given the quality design."
4,I was given Outlander as a retirement gift and have read the next two books so far. Spellbinding story-lots of passion and pretty gritty descriptions of everyday life in different places and times. It makes you feel somehow connected with these passionate people.
4,"This book continues the gripping story of Clair and Jamie, two characters who never seem to become less interesting. Usually in romance novels with recurring characters I find myself becoming disappointed in the fact that timeless characters seem mortal. Diana Gabaldon does an excellent job of overcoming this issue by introducing new elements and challenges. Though I am a great fan of romances, most can be summarized quite easily (guy meets girl, there's an attraction, followed by a misunderstanding, then finally things are sorted out and the man confesses his love). Diana Gabaldon's series is so much more! This story is so engrossing that I'd be surprised to find anyone who hasn't enjoyed it. If you are considering a romance, please take my advice and pick up all the books in this series ASAP! You won't be disappointed."
4,"All of Diana Gabaldon's books are true works of art. Of the thousands of books I've read her storytelling distinguishes her as an artistic craftsman capable of bringing to life complex and compelling stories that blur the mind's ability to reconcile that the story is fiction and not a personal account. Read them all, read the companion and then read them all again. Every word is worth it!"
4,"I won't spoil the story for you, however I will mention that I was in tears at the ending, and at various points through the book. I am rather surprised to see the amount of people complaining about how long it takes her to write these books--I am quite pleased to see she hasn't given in to the lure of fame and money, cutting down on the time between books and thereby producing stories that aren't as enthralling. I am waiting with baited breath for the sequel to Drums of Autumn (I am given to understand it is the beginning of a new trilogy), since I am sure it, too, will be worth the time spent waiting for it."
4,Drums of Autumn like her other books is an adventure and the romance and life of Claire and Jamie continue. It is worth reading and it is as amazing as her first three books.
4,"An excellent product. I bought one for my mom, then tried it, and bought one for myself. A great back support."
4,"I have owned my KitchenAid stand mixer for over 8 years and have had no problems with it whatsoever. This mixer is so great. I use whenever I can. It actually makes baking fun. Years ago I used to use my moms old Sunbeam mixer and whenever I tired to make a recipe that had a batter that was very thick it would slow the mixer down and sometimes it would stop on me. Not with the KitchenAid. I have had no slowdowns whatsoever. Even with the thickest dough and batters the KitchenAid never gives me any trouble. This is an appliance that you can leave on your countertop all the time because it looks great and you can pretty much get it in any color you want to match your kitchen. So, if you are in the market for a stand mixer and want to get your moneys worth then look no further. This is the mixer for you."
4,"Ridley does an excellent job of opening up issues regarding cultural competency in the mental health services professions. However, while the examples given do illustrate the problems as they currently exist, I found several of the ""how to"" examples of interaction rather condescending. Still, overall, the book is a great entry into just how and why the mental health field has not served our culturally-diverse populations in the past and how to better serve them in the future."
4,"As my review title indicates, the music of this CD goes deeper than your bones, but penetrates even your bone marrow. After hearing the absoultely hypnotizing track ""The Zodiac"" one morning on WJZF-FM in Atlanta, I knew I had to have the CD, which sounds like nothing else out there right now. The tracks contained on it can best be described in one word: R-E-A-L. It's just pure, unadulterated jazz at its best--without all the technological ""bells and whistles"" that so many other artists give you these days. You can tell these guys love playing together, and I really appreciate the dedication in the CD liner notes to ""the listeners"". I can't wait to see these guys live! Buy the CD, people. It'll make for a better summer, I promise!"
4,"The author wrote his book to show that God speaks to people of all faiths. The Bible, he writes does not belong to the Jews or to the Christians or to the Muslims alone; it belongs to all people. All people have the right to interpret the Bible as they want, as long they do no harm to others.And the religions need to work together. The Muslims taught the Jews and the Christians the philosophy of the Greeks by translating the ancient Greek philosophical works. The period of Enlightenment for Christianity and Judaism, the quest for a rational religion of nature, grew from the writings and teachings of other faiths. Judaism and Christianity contributed to the other and without the other neither would have advanced to the stage they are currently in."
4,"This is a great lightsaber but just a few exeptions, first off when your doing some tricks and the lightsaber's ""Ignite"" button usually hits your fingers and it turns it off.Second the length of the blades for WAY too short and that makes it unreal but other than that its a great toy and fun to play with."
4,"If you're into punk rock, this is the book for you! It isn't a dry history book, but rather a lively recounting of the real-life experiences of a young girl who lived through the heyday of punk rock. It's basically an inside look into her personal diary, and details some truly unforgetable stories. I won't give it all away - you've got to read it for yourself. Trust me, though, you're gonna love it!!"
4,"There are two primary plot lines in Firewall--a potential crime and the personal life of Inspect Wallandar, the police lead on the case. Mankell's smooth writing allows the reader to keep pace with a detailed plot. The introduction of new characters into the story is always well timed, in that they continue to hold the reader's interest and are congruent with the the story line.Inspecter Wallandar is a very human police inspector, struggling with loneliness, job anxiety, and retirement at some point in the future. His reflections on his personal relationships and career transcend both age and nationality.The translation of this book from Swedish is appears to be seamless and is easy to understand with apparently no loss of local color. This is the first Inspector Wallandar book I have read, and is good enough to entice me to seek out the others."
4,"Fourth Hurt Wallander book I have have now finished. Though sometimes the translation isn't great, the stories are compelling and keep you wanting more. Love them."
4,"It's true, the shirt is NOT stained by spilled food and it's comfortable, too. I've laundered it several times already and it comes out of the dryer looking like new. I like it a lot and will buy more of them. The shipping was fast and it arrived in perfect condition."
4,"I am very pleased with my purchase. It was as advertized. I haven't used it yet, but I'm sure it will work great."
4,"This is a real dark horse of a book. It seemed kind of slim and I wasn't expecting much, but, wow! Not only is it extremely well-researched, but it's beautifully written, and has real wisdom. I can't agree with the reviewer who criticized it as rambling. On the contrary, it's taut and focused, quite brilliant at times, especially (and I also disagree with the previous critic here) when Margolis deals with environmental matters. I work in this field, and I think Margolis's is one of the fairest, most balanced and wisest assessments I've come across. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a serious book about the future that's not a geeky bore."
4,"my first copy of ""the tipping point"" disappeared. i don't know if i lost it, or if it got stolen. i JUST BOUGHT another copy this past weekend, and guess what, yup lost again. so this is my third copy, and hopefully its the charm. my point is, yes this cd is that good. i think its extremely strange that it disappeared twice already, but it's a classic in my book, so if i have to buy it another 5 times for it to reach plaque status, i would."
4,"Although I've been involved with creating works of art all of my life, I wasn't able to call myself an artist until I started reading this book. There is so much knowledge within these pages, it is a must have for any potential artist or designer."
4,"Behold the ultimate background CD! It sets any mood perfectly from happy and upbeat to dark and mysterious.It has one flaw in it's perfection, in my humble oppinion most of the songs are absolutely meant to exist solely on the background, they set a perfect mood but they never reach beyond that. It's silent and manipulative music that crawls under your skin only to leave you with a strange sense of ""what have I just been listening to!""If you want a cd that is perfect for the background of a silent, moody night or party, most of the songs on this cd will do the trick. If you want a cd that is filled with music that sweeps you off of your feet and impresses you for days to come, then this cd isn't what you've been waiting for. If you're into beautifull mood-setting music or marvelous soundtracks then this is certainly what you've been looking for."
4,Have been satisfied with the original MAGLITE flashlights (especially the extra bulb located in the base cap). Found out (trial & error) that not all flashlight bulbs (despite appearance and fit) will work in these high end utility lamps. Letting someone borrow these excellant lites became a chore to have them returned.Haven't purchased the newer version MAGLITE & don't anticipate having to because of quality failure.
4,"Bought the book at Haslam's in St. Pete in the very early 80s. The ideas here just keep popping up in later books/magazines with different justifications for inclusion. Moral: hey, use all the ideas in this source book - just don't publicly brand them ""high-tech."""
4,"I play poker and I study card magic. I've lost my share of $$ at the poker table and I am very familiar with the culture of poker. I've seen many of the best cardmen around today and I've seen the mediocre who are hyped as the best, and I've seen those who are down right sh***y.This film is worth your attention for both story and excellent production values. Why this movie didn't receive wide release is a mystery considering the trash that receive the media hype to get you into the theater and the let down after sitting in the theater.The acting is solid and the creativity it took to portray the characters are excellent. The story is a familiar theme, but does keep you guessing. However, the end of the con was a complete surprise, finding a rightful place next to The Sting!The DVD extras are very good showing the making of the movie along with cast and crew interviews."
4,"I started this book early one night and just kept reading. The chapter ends are so Strategically placed that you cant stop. Each character is described in depth, so you feel bad when each one dies. Each area of the race has a new problem,(my favorite was the 21 tounge salute). The objective in this was great. It reminds me of school. If you fall below a 65 3 times, they are just a warning. But if you fall below a 65 a fourth time, it's over. If you outlast everyone else you are set for life, but don't be the first to buy your ticket..."
4,"I am an avid reader of Stephen King. This was the first book that made me wonder about the society these boys live that would allow them to take this walk. I loved the characters, friendships formed, and alliances that were forged and help among the boys to shield another. The only part that tore my heart out was the ending. After all that such heart break. I had to read the ending several times and then to my husband to get the whole meaning. Bravo Mr. King!"
4,"I've read The Long Walk well over 10 times in the last 10 years and it continues to get better and better. Once again, King has taken the most simplistic idea to an extreme to create an incredibly suspenseful tale. That idea, a sport where the loser pays the ultimate sacrifice. That sport, ultimately simplistic in itself. Walk. The characters have variety, diversity and depth. It is a riviting work that will hold your attention rapt from start to finish, exploring the depths of human consciousness. A must read for any true King fan. Not only the best Bachman book, but the best King book."
4,Couldn't put this book down. Just wanted to get to the end. Forgot how much I liked the way the King writes.
4,but thats probally what i would say about all of his books. a good read. makes you want to finish it.
4,"I've read everything published by Stephen King, and this story is by far my favorite. What makes this my favorite story is how the tension of life vs. death is constant, (stop walking and you die) so you don't want to stop reading, because you have to know which of the likeable and unlikable characters avoids the ever watching guards, and which ones tire and pay the ultimate price. The story is a metaphor for life, in that life also is like a long road you must keep walking on, or die. Also, `The Long Walk' is not as 'over the top' in unreal horror as SK's usual."
4,"This is my favorite Stephen King book, but I think it's because I imagined contests like this one when I was a kid. I've read it several times."
4,Fast paced.... Good read....Stephen king does it again...makes you feel as though you were walking right along with them the whole way.
4,"I came away with one main idea when finished with this 600 page tome of brilliance: Do not allow your soul to bend to your body, and do not allow your body to bend to your soul. This book is an expirience to read, and if you are familiar with Hesse's life, you will laugh with regularity at the sprinklings of subtle hilarity that litter the pages. The novel takes place in Castalia, a world dominated by the mind. The main character, Joseph, explores whether the world is a specious facade or a veritable heaven on earth. The esoteric ""glass bead game"" must be studied assiduously for years before one can begin to partake in the games. Joseph is dilegent but has massive growing pains that eventually lead to a overhaul of his beliefs."
4,"Sorry, my English is not as good as my German! After having reviewed some of the comments I get the feeling that some American friends are used to read short and simple sentences! German language is famous for the complicated structure and long sentences. It is wonderful to read this book in German esp. because of the use of language. I can imagine that the English translation could never reflect this beauty."
4,"This book has heat from beginning to end. Rena learns the hard way that the grass is not always greener on the other side of the fence. I loved the book! I couldn't put it down once I started reading it. As a sister I could relate to and appreciate the plight of Rena in dealing with her husband, and as a single woman I appreciated the details of the swinging life as seen by author Torrian Ferguson. I'm hoping for a sequel to this book. Shame on the editor for so many typos though. How unfortunate for Torrian his novel was filled with so many misspelled words. I still say it's an excellent book though, in spite of..."
4,"This is a good book by Birmingham. Written just after graduating high school, Our Time is Now is a collection of essays by the disillusioned high school students of the 1960s, and also includes excerpts from their underground publications. The essays grasp the students' anger and frustration with authority in a manner so poignant that Birmingham decided to let the words speak for themselves. It is an extremely useful resource for anyone studying this time period."
4,Valhalla Knights is an excellent RPG to arrive on the PSP system. Fans of the Final Fantasy series will greatly enjoy it in its similarities. I highly recomend this game to anyone who owns a PSP.
4,"I really enjoyed this thriller. From beginning to end, it kept me enthralled. This is the first novel I've read by Michael Lawson and sure not to be the last. I have one small gripe. When you get some really evil characters I think they should suffer some evil deaths. Not quick and painless."
4,"Molly Moon heads on her third hypnotic adventure, this time where time travel plays a crucial role in solving the mystery in this newest book. And yes, Molly does add to her hypnotic powers by learning how to time travel. Molly finds herself in India during 1870, where she meets a most rude and inconsiderate giant (he's actually a very large person, but it would be making him seem like a nice person, which he is the total opposite of) named Waqt, who also brings back three other Molly Moons; the baby, 3 year old, and 10 year old version of this currently eleven-year-old Molly. Waqt has an evil scheme up his enormous sleeves, which I won't tell you but let you figure out for yourself in this compelling third edition of Molly Moon's hypnotic adventure. Molly matures a tremendous amount in this book, which shows that the meek ten year old we met in the first book is growing up to possibly be the world's greatest hypnotist."
3,"The wand works fine, but not for cleaning leaves from gutters. It doesn't have the oomph. I'm thinking for taking it to the lake to become a kiddie shower."
3,"This book is utterly outdated. Please see Mao: The Unknown Story by Jung Chang and Jon Halliday and other more recent scholarly work.My rating of two stars is to give credit for a tremendous amount of work and consideration for the timeframe in which it was written, but this book should not stand alone as a history of the Long March at this time."
3,"Reading this book reminded me that even terrible authors could make a lot of money. I got used to Hollywood dishing out [crud], but books, I thought were always reserved for the truly talented. I was wrong. David Morell's [book] is an uninspiring, terribly written book that any fourth grade English teacher would have failed. You can't identify with the characters and the entire novel lacks any type of description or analysis to seperate it from the worst of action movies. Just because this a book involving action, doesn't mean it can do without intelligent writing. Pick up Ian Fleming's Bond series or read one of Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt adventures, but for any Rambo action: rent the movie, it's a lot better."
3,"These were simply ""ok"". I probably will not repurchase again. They are no better than drug store grade silicone bands."
3,"Too unstable to work on it...seems weak.simply didn't like it, wasn't made for me."
3,"I like some of the Ying Yang Twins,but there is a Energy&Edge missing on this Set. they seem to be going for a Polished vibe,which is taken the edge away from what they do best&that is making tight cuts or funny skits.alot of skipable tracks here."
3,"I wanna whisper a little something to all ya'll,(THIS ALBUM STINKS TO HIGH HEAVEN ALONG WITH SLIMM SCRUB AND DEBBIE(AKA WEBBIE). They got the right name because every thing that comes out of their mouth is a bunch of Ying Yang. By them knowing that they talk a bunch of ying yang, they must know that they're weak. With all of my reviews toward Dirty south rappers, you might notice that they all sound the same because their music is all the same.PEOPLE NEED TO WAKE UP AND UNDERSTAND THEY'RE LISTENING TO GARBAGE.THE ALBUM TILTLE USA SHOULD STAND FOR UNDER SATURATED A*SES BECAUSE THEIR MUSIC SOUNDS LIKE S*IT."
3,"This is the worst of the 80s -- boring, banal, overblown, overproduced, junk. ""The Warrior"" -- one of the worst songs ever written with one of the worst choruses ever written -- was a hit then because of its silly video -- today seen an embarrassing relic. The other ""hit"" - Sometimes love just ain't Enough"" is an insipid duet with Don Henley probably done to make a few bucks. Goodbye to You sounded refreshing in the post-disco, early MTV days of the early 80s and it's the only track that still has some spunk partly due to its cheesy organ solo. ""Love's got a Line on You"" sounds dated. The audacity of this record company to compile a ""Patty Smythe Greatest Hits"" album based on two tracks. Patty has a throaty vocals but thanks to the mediocre material she sang she won't even be a footnote in the histoy of rock."
3,"I was very disappointed when this arrived to find that it was just a normal recipe book, not one with recipes to use the Magic Bullet."
3,"I wish I had read the reviews on this book. It has NOTHING to do with the Magic Bullet Blender. Do not buy if your looking for a Magic Bullet Blender cookbook.It's not a terrible cookbook, but this author is getting a 1 star rating from me due to how misleading she is in her title."
3,"This book was part an Amazon buy together with Armstrong's Inspiring 1950's Interiors (which is what I was initially interested in purchasing); I expected something along the same lines. There aren't even any actual photographs. They're all drawings. The book is basically a story about what people did in the 1950's. If that's what you're looking for, then this would be up your alley. I was looking for more design inspiration. I wish that I would have purchased Armstrong's Inspiring 1960's Interiors instead."
3,"Easter Island is one of the most interesting places in the world, but you would never know it from this text that is so much like geography textbooks of old that you don't want to even turn the page. What does keep you turning the pages are the pictures which are quite beautiful and, in themselves, illuminating... A worthy effort, with solid information..."
3,"Why bother reading a book that begins with the premise that humans are omnivores? Many experts believe humans are herbivores-search Google, you'll find many qualified articles on the subject. There are no ""dilemmas"" for herbivores-eat whole, plant based foods. And live a very long, vigorous life. The science is clear-it's pop culture that's confused. Read The China Study or Diet for a New America.The way to good health and a vastly improved environment could not be simpler or clearer:remember the four food groups; 5 servings of whole grains, 4 servings of veggies, 3 servings of fruit, 2 servings of legumes. Live long and prosper...and have great sex until your 90!"
3,"This book, which repeats so much already published, basically follows through to its initial premise: that food in america is unsustainable. Along the way, the author indulges himself in great celebrity and ego stroking wit. The segment on the boar hunting is quite hypocritical. The main thrust of the author's theory is that all systems, including alternative, are unsustainable. The conclusion he avoids, is that the failure to find a solution will result in many deaths, if not the extinction of human culture as we know it. Perhaps, all that anyone can learn here is that it is hopeless, go back home, accept your fat and your fate, and try to die quietly. So many other books are better than this one. Unless you are a total newbie to these debates, you will find little that is refreshing here. The author basically finishes where he begins, with nothing but personal insights, and no insight into a broader solution for ""sustainable"" food sources."
3,You have to deal with lumps. I tried sifting it and in the sifter i found hard little lumps that will not break up. Flavor is fine though. I started using Florida Crystal brand and it works great hardly have to sift it.
3,"The manufacturer's claim that this extension cord reel has the capacity to hold a 150 feet of cord is highly exaggerated. While it might work just fine for 150 feet of very light-weight extension cord, it's reel capacity is not adequate for even a 100 foot heavy-duty outdoor extension cord. I bought it to use with the Coleman 100 foot, 12 gauge/3 wire, low-temp outdoor extension cord. The Designers Edge reel was completely full by the time I had wound 80 feet of the cord onto it. I'm not happy with the product but I'm happy that Amazon makes it easy to return items that are unsatisfactory."
3,"Man, this cat'z trippin. When i first heard Danny D, i was all like ""damn, this brothers comin' from the heart man. He's really feeling it"" so when this bomb dropped, i was all up in the store clerks face with my benjamins. But after spinning this wack joint, all my respect for him has gone. You've sold out G. He's replaced heart breakin for money makin. From now own, i'm stickin wit my brothers Foster and Allen. They always be keeping it real, Aiight!. Yo, Peace and I'm out."
3,"Tried this for a month. Didn't really help with my IBS, but then nothing else has either. . . ."
3,"It worked for sometime so that is why I said ""almost""First the PSU died. Replaced the PSU. A year later the motherboard is toast.These are major issues. Need to do some troubleshooting to see if the HDD is ok."
3,"A few years ago I bought my oldest child the Antworks gel antfarm and it was A-MAZ-ING! So, when I saw Uncle Milton's gel antfarm when I was shopping for my son's 11th birthday, I was really excited. I figured, how different could it be? Was I wrong or what? We got one vial of ants (no problem with the shipping) and they seemed to be OK. However, after they dug two short little tunnels at the top, they died. OK. We ordered two more vials of ants (again, no problem with the shipping). After only a few weeks, all were dead and mold was growing in the habitat. Into the trash that thing goes... there's about $35.00 I'll never get back. BTW, I also got him an Uncle Milton's frog habitat. Three months later and we still haven't gotten the tadpoles. Maybe it's better that way."
3,"Its been two months, and the ants never came despite contact with the company. Meanwhile the gel has dried up. Money wasted. Child disappointed"
3,"Got this for my son's birthday. Waited 2 months for the 'included ants'. You have to mail off for them and pay 9.95 that doesn't sound included to me! In the 2 months we waited for the ants the gel separated from the glass. Once we got the ants the majority of them died within the 1st 2 hrs. others got stuck in the gapping holes where the gel separated while we waited for our 'included ants'. I think that about 3 of the ants are still alive, its only been 2 days since we got the ants. Not worth the money invested! My son was really into seeing them tunnel and make their home. BIG RIPOFF UNCLE MILTON!"
3,Wish I had known how old this software title is and that it wouldn't run on my computer. Complete waste of Money. Sounded like a perfect game. Hope they update it for this century.
3,My 10-year old daughter was reading this book for school. She brought to my attention that the book contained explicit sexual descriptions and profanity. To my shock the irresponsible publisher (Penguin Putnam/Puffin books) has recommended this book for ages 10 and older. I am thankful that I have a daughter that is more prudent and responsible than the publishers who ask us to trust them.
3,"This cover fits fairly well and the issue is it tears.A jeep has sharp edges (the front bumper) and the coveris tissue thin and fell apart quickly... sad, as thefit was good, and just too thin and poor quality."
3,I have had this cover for less then a year it is starting to tear.i only hope their return and replace policy is better then their product!
3,"This is the worst rendition of an Arthurian mythos CD I have seen. I wouldn't recommend it, it was boring. The comedic tone really bogs it down."
3,"Eric Idle, don't come back, ever!""Spamalot"" is perhaps the most overrated, overpunned and overwritten Broadway musical since ""Thorougly Moddern Millie"" or ""The Producers."" A little low on wit and a little high on production, the show is ""Forbidden Broadway"" with a big budget.How can someone call this shamefully amaturish score the best Broadway score in years? How can ""The Song that Goes Like This"" and ""You Won't Succeed on Broadway"" go onto become classics? Crtics. And the New York critics, which are mixed about ""Light in the Piazza"" and ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"", easilly two of the best entries on the 2004-2005 season, are not worthe reading. Don't buy this album."
3,Bought this for three small barkers. worked great for a week. Then it died. So sad. What a waste of money!!!Pet Parade Dog Repeller and Training Aid
3,"worked about two times, now the dogs just ignore it.maybe works for others, item is not bad quality. Just didnt' work for my dogs."
3,Item worked great when we first got it. Today tried to use it but light was faint and did not seem to work on dog. Battery was perfect. So I guess since only thirty days I had to send it back means it only last thirty days.
3,"This might work well as a training aid, but it doesn't even remotely repel my dog or even make her uncomfortable. So I don't hold much hope for the neighbors dogs to go running away scared."
3,"I can hear it make a noise, my dog does not react at all. Aside from giving my family a good laugh this was a total waste of money and time."
3,"This product did not work at all. The batery is good, the light works and the dog totally ignores it,aaor does not hear it at all. But he hears everything else quite well."
3,"Put new batteries in it. Pressed button, Light came on and nothing happened. Tried it on 4 different dogs from various ranges and none of them even flinched. Waste of time and money. Return was easy enough though."
3,I ordered this product to help when a dog chases me on my bicycle. I don't hear the unit do anything and it seems that dogs don't either. I have tried it up close with different dogs with no results. Waste of money in my case
3,"My dog definitely knew when I was pushing the button, and it was VERY helpful at getting him to stop some undesirable behaviors. But then after about a week it stopped working: Press the button, no indicator light and no reaction from the dog. Changing the batteries yielded no improvement. I would suggest buying a similar product, but not this one."
3,"Either I have an extremely stubborn dog, or this isn't what it's cracked up to be. I can hear the sound. But I had to try it."
3,Ordered a dog repeller and received a 'no woof - dog training' aid.....I wanted something to scare mutts away when my mom goes on walks...this does not look like the one for the job! very upset and will send this one back.
3,Cheep plastic.... Didn't even make the dog blink.... Barking never changed... did nothing but take money from my pocket.m NOT RECOMENDED!
3,"My dog reacted to the button a few times, but then he responded by barking and biting at the button. I will use other training methods, that will take more work, but end up more effective."
3,"I don't know why they call this item a dog repeller, my dog comes when I push it sometimes. It will get her attention as long as she is not really interested in something else. I had purchased it hoping to repell dogs that are off leash that would come up to us when we are out walking, since my dog growls and wants to start a fight with with these dogs. Since I don't know if it will attract or repell these same dogs I haven't tried it in this situation. Hope this review helps.J.P."
3,"Our neighbor has 2 chocolate labs who bark at anything that moves, including us. They can see us just barely through the fence. I tried this looking at other reviews. What did I get? Less money in my bank account. Simply put...it did not work. They did not even flinch. In fact, I could have swore they barked MORE! All I know is that in my case it did not work. Note to everyone that has cats...DO NOT test this inside. They REALLY do not like it. Maybe this should be called a cat repellant?"
3,"We bought this in hopes of shutting up our neighbor's neglected dogs so we could maybe enjoy our neighborhood again. We were kind of desperate since our complaints to the neighbor have been ignored.When the dogs are barking because they're bored the device works okay. We point it at them and press the button and they go running into their little dog house where they stay quiet for a good 15 minutes.However, when the dogs are barking at something good, say the other neighbor's cat or a squirrel, the device doesn't do anything at all. The dogs will look over at us for a second when we hit the button but then they go right back to barking again.This may work just fine as a training aid for your own dog, but using it on someone else's dogs sure doesn't work."
3,"I bought this as a training aid to teach my puppy not to bark at people. He doesn't even pay attention to it. I stood probably 2 feet away and he ignored it. I don't know whether it's simply that he is a puppy and has the attention span of a goldfish or if it really is just a piece of junk. Either way, it didn't work for me."
3,I've tried this product but to no avail... it does not get the attention of the three small dogs of my neighbors.I plan to return the product..does not do as advertised.
3,if you buy this you make a mistake. if you believe that the dog will scare by this product will make the beegest mistake that you ever did.
3,"I got this item to try and train my dogs to stop barking when friends come over to the house. I don't mind them barking to let me know someone is here but once I know who it is or that there's no danger, I want them to stop. This device did NOTHING for either dog (7 year old lab, 1 year old shepherd). They did seem to hear it as their ears twitched a little, but it wasn't strong enough to really get their attention. I don't think this would work if a pit bull ran up to you, either! Don't waste your money on this."
3,"Our new neighbor has dogs that keep barking at us when we are outside in our yard playing with our kids. These dogs sound very scary and they frighten the kids. Sometime they would ram the fence like they are trying to get through. We bought this device in hopes that we can quiet them down a bit. We tried it a 15ft, 10ft, 5ft, and even at 1ft. IT DOESN'T WORK.We recycled it because we figured the time and cost to return it would have cost more than it's worth.BTW, I installed a new 9v battery and the LED comes ON when the button is pressed."
3,Okay I was having problems with my Black Lab barking at random times. I tried this and for the first few days it worked somewhat. But then after a few days he got used to it and just continued to bark. I even tried this on the neighbor dog within a reasonable distance and it didn't work for that dog. Waste of money.
3,Worked for one day then stopped. I would not recommend its purchase by anyone unless you are giving to an enemy.
3,"I've had this wrist wrest at work for a little under a year now. Amazon says I ordered it on September 9, 2009. When I first got it, I noticed that the gel on the inside was in two pieces laterally along the length of the wrist wrest (it is supposed to be one piece). It didn't really effect the function of it so I didn't waste my money returning it. About 6 months ago, the seams around the outside opened and let tiny white pieces of gel substance come out (even though its supposed to be one gel unit inside). I had to glue it back together. Now, any place I didn't glue it, the seams are ripping. Its now basically held together with glue and the gel on the inside is disintegrating (drying up and cracking). It sounds like I may have gotten a bad unit as many of the other reviews here are good.Basically, the unit has been shrinking, drying up, and ripping at the seams slowly over time. The product is cheaply made."
3,"It is past the time I can return this product, or I would. I bought this In Febuary of this year 2012, and I am not on my computer all that much, I mainly do face book & emails, so by no means was I hard on this, but about a 2 weeks ago it started to make like a crinkle notice everytime wrist rested on it. All the gel that was in it seems to all have dis appeared or something. It did not leak out, but there is no gel left in it. It's not useful anymore. I would not waste your money on this one. I have tried to contact the seller, but I guess it's past the time. But I have only had it & used it very lightly for 3 months."
3,"I was very excited to give this gift to my granddaughter. Mixed all the ingredients, turned it on---nothing happened. We had new batteries. We manually stirred the mixture during the freezing process. It tasted great when frozen."
3,"I don't consider myself a particularly good writer, and I know for a fact that I couldn't market ice water in a desert, so I would never presume to know more about PR than someone who does it professionally. Nevertheless, everything in this book falls under what I would tend to refer to as ""common sense"" and/or ""not worth paying for."" If you graduated from an American high school and do not know the difference between ""there,"" ""they're"" and ""their,"" then you need a lot more help than any single book can give. Nevertheless, that's the sort of remedial composition this title is dedicated to. I suppose the example press releases are useful, but you can find thousands of those free of charge on the internet."
3,"the title says it all... this isn't really my thing for taylor... glad he won american idol though, he gave a twist to the stereotype of pop princess that i'm sure everyone's sick of... but i expect much better things from him!!"
3,"The fact that anyone would publish a book this bad is amazing.The only thing horrifying about this book is its attack on prose. Idon't know what book all these other reviewers read, because the ""Killer of Love"" that I got a hold of was full of high school level writing and self- conscious hyperbole. It reads like a 1950s ""killer teen"" trash novel. To say that the characters were flat and ""cardboard"" would be an insult to paper products everywhere. Piper, the supposed ""root of all evil,"" was only as frightening as the average open mike night poet. I wish whoever is paying these other people to write in would just stop. I only gave this one star because it made me."
3,"This is what happens when monkeys get payed to make music.All this is is just repetative nonsense. And not very good repetative nonsense at that. Or maybe I'm just jealous because I can't hear ""the beat."" xD"
3,I think the songs were beautiful and Nora sang very well but the cost was outrageous for such a short CD.
3,This item is not the one pictured. This is a standard optical cable on both ends. I needed the mini earphone style plug at one end to plug into my Mac.
3,"watch out for this one folks , says 20 ft. is less than 18 . quality is so so too , so much so that this long time pro monster customer thinks this is a possible knock off . if it isnt , it sure is a poor choice of monster to market . ive used and purchased myriads of monster products in the music business and own hundreds of dollars in monster cables personally . pros expect more from monster....."
3,"I was slightly disappointed with this purchase. I've purchased from you guys before and I've gotten quality products but not this time. The Bluray that was sent to me was not the original Bluray that was in the box. It was a Bluray that was a rental off of Redbox, Blockbuster or some other DVD rental location. The Bluray itself says ""Rental""."
3,This is not the Sherlock Holmes we have loved from the books. His brilliant use of logic to solve crimes appears for only about 5 minutes near the end of the film. Otherwise the character is dumbed-down to appeal to fans of Fight Club. The plot is incoherent. It's really a waste of 2 hours of your time.
3,"Ads for the new release lured me to watch the original via Amazon. What a disappointment. First I think it was well casted and generally moved along at a quick pace, but the story line jumped all over the place, the dependence on so-so special effects wore thin real fast and worst of all, the soundtrack was awful - even though we viewed the Blu-Ray version with a good home theater setup. I will NOT be going to see the sequel."
3,There are about 10 minutes of previews and stupid things that you must watch before being able to see the movie. Skip the blu-ray until they fix this. I had rented it from NetFlix.
3,"The only magic in this film is that an inherently witty, intelligent production was turned into such a boring, dreary mess. It takes real talent to destroy Sherlock Holmes like this"
3,"Unfortunately, my DVD seemed like a pirated copy of the film I thought I was purchasing. It not only randomly would glitch and go back to certain points in the movie over and over again, but I had no access to the menu items like the extras or the chapters.I went back online to Walmart and purchased a real copy"
3,"I tried to cancel this order, but your software would not let me do that. You should reveiw your software."
3,Movie Sherlock Holmes was boring. It was too slow. Just could nto get into it. Never finished it. Wasted money.
3,"As much as I admire Downey as a uniquely talented actor, this film simply did not work for me. Not only is SH made into a boxer and street fighter, but he is something of a rebel rake. This goes against my memories of him as an austere Victorian who survived and thrived by his wits more than his fists. Also, perhaps I am getting old, but I have absolutely no recollection of what the caper was, which is a sure sign (to me) that it failed to engage me in the slightest.Not recommended."
3,"This was one of the worst films I've ever seen. If I could find one good point I would mention it, but there are none. Check that, the actors do try hard to save this disaster, but they just couldn't fight the lousy script."
3,"Terrible film.................bad music, all characters were miscast, and too much very poor cgi. The costumes were ridiculous and the sets were poorly designed and dressed. Most Holmes films are enjoyable...this one was not."
3,"Yes, that's what I said. Let's be clear -- I love the classic Sherlock Holmes movies with Basil Rathbone, I'm a fan of Ritchie movies like ""Snatch"", and I think Robert Downey Jr. is a talented actor -- but this was the first time the Sherlock Holmes character was completely boring. Neither the action nor the plot saved the movie for me and it wasn't Downey Jr's fault either. I just don't think the Guy Ritchie style works for what I want to see with Sherlock Holmes."
3,"The Goats milk soap is a wonderful product. It is one of the few soaps we can use in our home due to skin allergies.This review is specific to the seller NUTRICITY. Do not purchase this product from them. They list the soap as a 6 pack of soap for the amount indicated usually around 6 dollars or so. I thought this was a great deal so I purchased 5 orders which would be 30 bars of soap. However, when I received the package there were only 5 bars of soap. I contacted them immediately but they refused to send the rest of the bars, they did refund the rest of the money back to my account but that is not what I wanted.I searched on Amazon for the soap again today and the item description is still incorrect. It still lists the product as a 6 pack of soap. It is very sad that Amazon allows this seller to remain on Amazon with false advertising!"
3,What was this. I didn't listen to this (not that I would want to) but this has to be the worst thing ever invented.
3,The book cover was torn and I had to ship it back. Unfortunately. Waste of time and money. Did not have a good experience.
3,i bought it for one song. one frigging song not available on any of her albums thats niki the backup singer for madonna who ironically sings amazingly better then madonna. the rest of the songs are good but i would go popping it in the cd player for drive in the car. no thats reserved the murphys boys.
3,I have purchased these shoes before and never had a problem. I have small wide feet and ordered these in EW. Easy Spirit must have changed their sizing these were way too narrow and I had to return the shoes.
3,"In person the boots looked like the picture, but the leather seemed low quality considering the price. It was like stiff cowhide, and when I tried on weren't comfy at all. Not enough padding in the boot I think."
3,"When I first bought this album I was so psyched. What I ended up hearing made me give the album away. This is the ""new"" moe. Its a weak attempt at getting radio friendly. Its crunchy, and it lacks soul, spirit, and most of all, the in-your-face basslines from Rob Derhak that were splattered all over the old Moe albums. Did anyone notice that some of the guitar solos in here were taken directly from old moe songs? I didn't think that that was very professional. Buy either Headseed or No Doy instead, you'll see what I mean."
3,"In this kind of product, expectations are mostly on the software that is supposed to simulate exam environment. I am really displeased at the quality of this most amateurish work. The dial reading never worked, and the questions of the math test are mostly based on miles to kilometers and vice versa conversions which are (according to the author) not included in the exam scheme! Do try harder please!"
3,The camera in this kit expired at year ago and the scanning coupon expired in 2000! I was so disappointed!
3,Handlebars a disaster. Created by someone who never rode a bike. Can't stand and pedal like a spinning bike. It is quiet. Good for spinning while sitting only. Serious spinners will be disappointed. Keiser M3 a better option. Ride before buying the Kettler.
3,"I bought this hose at Home Depot (actually, the 50 ft version) on sale for 9.99. It broke in 1 day of normal use. I have a water sprayer-nozzle on the hose and left the water running overnight. I think that pressure caused it to burst with a quarter size hole. Unless you use a hose without a spray-nozzle, this hose is not worth the time or hassle. In addition, its made with cancer-causing agents -- check the ""do not drink from this hose"" warnings. It's made with chemicals that are known to cause cancer and birth defects. How ""real"" this is, I am not sure. But it's a very unsettling mandatory warning on the packaging. Farming sites I read said many hoses have this, and to let the water run before applying it to plants.Still, with breakage AND cancer, I say just buy another hose!!"
3,"In terms of language and composition, this novel starves for artistry. Being written in third person, I see no reason for such pedantic language. I will give credit to the authoress however for being understandable. Too often in novels is the reader so swept away in flourishes of language, that they miss the plot entirely.The plot itself was not terrible, and it had some worthy ideas on the subjects of love and personal growth. Some of the character developments I found to be rather unbelievable even given the setting, but this is merely a matter of opinion.Also, though I realize that this novel was most likely written for a strongly Christian audience, I feel that it alienated, almost callously, any reader who doesn't belive, accept or wavers from what I would call orthodox Christian beliefs. Being very open-minded in this regard, this overriding attitude certainly ruined any aspect of the novel I might have enjoyed."
3,"I purchased this set as a gift for a new juggler. I was really disappointed because the juggling set did not come with the scarves or the spinning plate. The stuff it did come with was super cheap! I didn't have really high expectations, but I at least hoped to receive what was pictured and equipment that one could juggle. I am a very experienced juggler and was not even able to juggle the pins. They were too light, flimsy, and not properly balanced. It is really too bad because I bought it primarily because of the pins. The rings are okay....there are four of them which I thought was strange. The balls are okay as well, but are made for small hands. This might be an okay gift for really young kids learning to juggle, but not for anyone else. I don't understand how kids can learn using this equipment when seasoned jugglers have so much trouble using it. All in all, I do not recommend this product. If you want to learn to juggle, use a few tennis balls."
3,Cheaply made. The juggling balls were awful. They are more like cubes than balls. Spinning plate was useless. Stick used for the plate was wobbly plastic. The rings and scarves are OK. Clubs are just toys and not very good. Booklet was OK.
3,"This book is extremely disappointing. The publisher Michael Waite has admitted that the book covers the 1.02 JDK and not the 1.1. He had Lemay do a quick change to the Java 1.02 in 21 days..(basically added a lot of junk filler) to turn out this book. It is poorly organized, full of errors and code that won't compile, the advertised mentors do not exist, confusing, and all in all a waste of money! If you want a good book by a guy that seems to really have it together, try Core Java 1.1 vol 1, 3rd Ed."
3,"It does not keep the coffee hot for long. It keeps it ""luke warm"" but not hot. I love the mug and keep putting hot coffee in it to keep it warm."
3,JUNK - Plain & Simple. Tore up within the first week of moderate use. VERY shoddy workmanship & INCREDIBLY OVERPRICED.Tried these for kickboxing & savate. What a waste of $$$. Found MUCH better at www.isba-usa.com (savate kickboxing shoes). Very durable for around the same price as this junk. ONE UPSIDE of Discipline shoes: the achilles tendon slit at the back is a good design. That is a feature unique in kicking VS boxing/wrestling shoes. It was a good idea but POORLY executed.
3,"This book makes it easy for breastfeeding moms to give up and not feel guilty about it. If you think you will cop out and want to feel better about yourself, buy this book ...and do what's best for your child."
3,"Stargate SG-1 the next generation...I read somewhere that those people who create psychotic fantasy worldsget further and further from the here and now asthey get more involved in the psychosis.True science fiction is about making predictions about the futurethat may prevent technology from overpowering humanity.Star Trek the nth generation and SG-1 by moving into religionand other galaxies and further from actual hard science have become 'fantasy' like dungeons and dragons with science that ismore in the realm of 'magic' than reality.It was a pretty adventure, but we feel they are never really indanger as 'good' always prevails in this sort of 'B'sci fi series."
3,"Making people laugh is the lowest form of humor, according to the late Michael O'Donoghue.Well, Firesign is heading in that direction with this album. They try to maintain a dark atmosphere for effect's sake, but largely this album is only untraceable puns and retreaded jokes. The new characters created here are not funny or even amusing as stereotypes.The fellows are old, and they don't like the era in which we live. They've gone from social commentators to borscht belt humor in this one...good thing Boom Dot Bust was better!"
3,"This was my first BP book, and I found Gail Connor to be rather unlikable. She alternates between over-protecting and neglecting her daughter, uses people to get what she wants, takes drugs when she gets overwhelmed at work, and justifies stealing based on who's more deserving. Her client often acted like a jerk, so I found it hard to care who won.Most of the secondary characters were likable - I found it hard to believe they cared so much about Gail.I'd recommend any of Robert Parker's books over this - his characters are honest, intelligent and clever, and the relationships are believable."
3,"Boy, it would be nice if I could actually review a CROSSOVER CABLE. I ordered a CROSSOVER CABLE. A ""Belkin 50ft 10/100BT RJ45M/RJ45M Molded Gray Boot Cat5e Crossover Cable (Yellow)"" to be exact. Described here as having snagless boots.What did I get? A 50ft yellow PATCH cable with NO SNAGLESS BOOTS. Please Computer Brain(less), If you're going to have the audacity to charge as much to ship a cable as to sell it, MAKE SURE ITS THE RIGHT &%$*#@% CABLE! A PATCH CABLE DOES ME NO GOOD, AND NOW I GET TO WASTE MY TIME RETURNING THE SHIPMENT AND CHASING DOWN MY REFUND.ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS AS A VENDOR IN MY OPINION. KNOW YOUR PRODUCT!"
3,"For a video passed off as Bloopermania, you would expect the whole tape to be bloopers, right? Wrong! Only a few bloopers, shown from various angles, and the rest were tough shots, again shown ad nauseum. Don't waste your money."
3,"This episode was far from amazing. I was disappointed. I felt like i knew exacty what was going to happen. It reminded me of back to the future, when marty went back to the old west."
3,"Green Mountain recently (and inexplicably) discontinued their ""Hazelnut Cream"" brand. I came here hoping to pick some up, and ordered two cases. Much to my surprise, what was delivered was not ""Hazelnut Cream"" -- which other reviewers have noted is the best of all flavors -- but just plain ""Hazelnut,"" which tastes like a mix of liquified dirt and bitters.In short, do not expect Hazelnut Cream -- you will be getting ""Hazelnut,"" which tastes horrendous."
3,I bought this because my sons needed sound effects for a project. But while the animal sounds were extremely authentic they were much too short to be useful. At just a few seconds we had to tape the same short sound over and over which just didn't work out well. So if you're needing sound effects this CD isn't for you.
3,Sony camcorders have a factory defect that the ccd screen goes black when in record mode after a few tapes of use. I was asked to pay $270 to fix it. Beware.. there are thousands of such reported problems on this and other camcorder review sites. I would suggest that you read them before buying a Sony product.
3,"Arrived with two if the tips broken off, despite being very well packaged. By the time Halloween night rolled around I think the rest of them had fallen off. Cheap price, but equally cheap quality."
3,"OMG, this cable sooo fast that when my dog walked next to it, it DIED. The Monster cable actually sucked out my dog's will to live...it is just THAT FAST!!!!111"
3,I bought this after my previous electric blanket (which I'd had for a year) had a malfunctioning control. Years ago I had a Sunbeam electric blanket and it was great. This one is practically worthless. I like to turn the blanket on about 15 minutes before bed to get the sheets warm because I'm usually freezing at that time of night--I keep the thermostat pretty low--and can't sleep if I'm cold. As soon as I get comfortable I turn the blanket off because I don't like to sleep with it on all night. This blanket doesn't even get warm: it barely takes the chill out of the sheets and even for that I have to turn it on at least 30-45 minutes ahead of time. If you want to get into a warm bed I would definitely not recommend this blanket.
3,"I purchased this blanket three years ago. Last year it didn't seem to get very warm. This year it stopped working completely. Totally cold. If you search the web for other sites with reviews of this product, they all tell the same sorry story. I will be trying to get warranty service. BTW, the Northern electric blanket we bought around 1961 still works great. Even survived a couple year tour of duty in college. So much for technological advancement. I will never buy a Sunbeam again. Shoddy product."
3,"The balls are very colorful with all the country flags and are easy to use, but definitely NOT for a middle school of rambuncious students. We purchased several balls beginning of April. By May, they were deflated and torn. Need to be replaced again. I would repurchase for home use, but not for a school environment.Seller was great though. Very helpful."
3,very weak development of plot and characters in what could have been a much betterr story without the excessive religious overtones. couldn't finish it.
3,"We had a similar problem...my girlfriend's wings screen went out after 10 days or so. The screen is totally blank. There was no external damage to the phone or screen. She got charged $100 for the warranty exchange, stating they found physical damage to the phone and is not covered by warranty. She contacted customer care and requested they return the phone and was told the phone has been destroyed.Destroyed...really? I doubt they destroyed the phone. They just want to make $100 profit. If they return the phone they got no profit. They probably just replace the screen on my old phone and sell it for $200 or so.I believe it costs them less than $100 to make the POOR quality Wing because it costs Apple only $100 (you can find this info. By searching online) to make the new 3G iPhone which is a lot more advance than the Wing."
3,"This device doesn't have enough resource to run Windows Pocket 6.0 properly.You end up restarting your phone like 10 times a day. If you have more than 100 contacts and receiving 25 or more email a day then this device is not for you. Exchange sync keeps failing most of the times, and almost every time you run 2 applications at the same time phone fails and requires restart.The device itself is kind of heavy but it has a good design. I like the color. It has a poor battery life.I switched to Blackberry 8820, and I am pretty happy now."
3,"I purchased this book online, and was quite excited about reading it. I was sorely disappointed. The book was very one-sided and does not give a very accurate representation of the industry. Though I share some of Volpe's beliefs (I am a vegetarian) I encourage people who are interested in this topic to read a different book, FAST FOOD NATION by Eric Schlosser, which is one of my favorites and contains far more information. Volpe's book reads like a dumbed-down version of Scholosser's book crossed with a PETA film (which is just a different kind of misinformation than the meat companies offer us). Volpe's book also ignores the human suffering that accompanies the meat industry, a VERY good reason to be a vegetarian. I wish I had nicer things to say, because I WANTED to like this book. I can't even donate it to the library; I don't want anyone to make the same mistake I did."
3,"I bought this antenna, believing my troubles were over, based on the majority of the reviews. Boy was I in for a suprise! It brings in ONE station just a little better than before, another station, the sound is better. Overall, I get 8 stations, the same as with my broken rabbit ears. Plus the fact that you must have the antenna lined up perfectly for any clarity."
3,the phillips antennt does a good job but is very directional the furthest transmitter is 12 miles from my house and they are spread from 6 degrees to 307 degrees and I can only receive from the stations at the 300deg. area. there some on uhf and vhf and they all com in about the same. I would like to return this antenna for one that does a better job.
3,"This is a terrible book that is supposed to be based on credible research but which is mainly filled with guessing and conjecture. The book revolves around a map that could describe, with proper stretching, changing of markings and such, the New World, reminding me of the ""science"" that is the translation of Nostradamus' prophecies. Menzies links any unexplained artifacts around the world that may date to the early 1400s to this particular expedition, and repeatedly discounts without argument other logical explanations that would likely have created these artifacts.The likelihood of this story being true is further degraded by fact that the Chinese, a civilization known for keeping detailed records of its history, have never, before or after the publication of this book, attempted to claim any role in the discovery of the Americas.Placed in the fiction section I would give it two stars. Promoted as a serious piece of research and historical fact, it deserves zero."
3,"Much has been written about this author's thesis that the Chinese charted much of the world in the early 15th century. In my view, the evidence is circumstantial and highly suspect, and the book is very lightly footnoted. More importantly, though, this book reads as if it was written by, well, a submarine captain. Interesting ideas are occasionally brought up, only to be forgotten in the next paragraph. Many arguments are disjointed, leaving the reader to scratch his head when trying to understand how the author arrived at certain conclusions. In one chapter, the author digresses into a story about an African safari that ended when an enraged hippo threw a boat over the author's head! Gavin Menzies may indeed have discovered some compelling evidence for China's exploration of the world in 1421-1423, but he should have hired a real writer to help him make that evidence convincing."
3,"This was an easy read - the author is indeed good at his craft. However, it is not factual and yet portrays itself as such. I could have rated this higher if the books admitted that the outlandish ideas presented are speculation. Everything, though, is presented as facts. This is misleading, and has caused many readers to misinterpret wishful theory as historical fact."
3,This book is a shameless mishmash of speculation and misdirection that only obscures the extraordinary voyages of the Chinese 15th century mariners. There are some good books out there about the Zheng He voyages - read them instead of this tripe.
3,"Before you buy 1421, beg, borrow or buy a copy of ""Collingridge, George: The Discovery of Australia, 1895 (Outsized)"". Reprinted a century later.In this superb book Collingridge compares literally hundreds of claims to early world discovery, dating from 100 AD to 1770 AD, including the 1421 one. Some have merit, the 1421 claim is one that has least merit.The maps are better than Menzies'. The scolarship is better. The readability is better."
3,"I'm thinking about burning this one. If it wasn't for the burning sensation in my eyes from reading the same dull, ""Be the Brand, Raw, Raw, look at me being the brand!"" I would toss this one into the lake but fear it would pollute our water supply. Can you imagine all the brainless Executives running around spewing tag lines from this book? The, ""I get it, I want it, I can't get it anywhere else"" line made me vomit. You don't get it Steve. You just don't get it, but you CAN get a serious case of hemroids from reading this book."
3,"This cd has lots of jams in it,although it has lots of tight lyrics but no beat or bass.It's one of those cd's that you think is dumb and you want to return it. A do not bye"
3,"Very disappointed after receiving these shipping bags.I had ordered some in the past from the same company, and these were much less sturdy and tear very easily.Wish I hand't used some...or they'd be returned."
3,"THIS IS A TERRIBLE PRODUCT IS MADE OF CHEAP PLASTIC AND AFTER YOU ATTACH IT TO CAMERA THERE IS A LOT OF PLAY IT DOES NOT FIT NICE AND TIGHT,IT MAKES THE CAMERA FEEL CHEAP, THE PEOPLE WHO DESIGNED THIS JUNK DO NOT HAVE ANY IDEA OF MEASUREMENTS, IT WOULD HAVE MADE SENSE IF A DIFFERENT COMPANY MADE THIS THING.... BUT CANON MADE THIS...I DON'T GET IT WHY IT DOES NOT FIT PERFECTLY SNUGH.BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARDS GUYS!!"
3,I purchased this product for my new PowerShot S5IS camera. I was disapointed to find that this product is made of plastic. For the price I paid I expected better build quality than plastic. I plan on buying a much less costly replacement lens adaptor that is made of metal that I noticed on this site. I use my camera daily in my appraisal business and need all the components to be durable and dependable. I am disapointed that Canon would make this product with plastic and charge so much for it.

3,"of the four ex albums i own, this is far and away the most boring and expendable. i saw them on this tour and the songs from this album were great, so i suspect that they recorded the thing before the songs had fully gelled. fortunately at their show, they had all their out-of-print discs for sale so i got to pick up ""scrabbling the locks,"" which is their best. ""starters alternators"" just might be their worst..."
3,"The only thing that has ever haunted me about Sabrina(Salerno) can be seen on the cover of this compilation: her breasts. Sure, she had a cute, vibrant voice with that funny italian accent and her smash hit 'Boys' was a bright,sexy,goodhumoured thing (preferably combined with the sultry video - she was only 19 at the time and had an appearance that made your tongue hang out).'All of me' was the second release from that period (also with a beach video), I think it did pretty well on the charts.The other songs I'm afraid are rather forgettable, impersonal pop-workmanship, not even the professionalism from writers like Moroder can save the ship - or the bra - from sinking."
3,"If you liked the first in this trilogy ""Cape Refuge"" you will like this one also. It's more of the same. I read on hoping things would improve, but this is not a good mystery. It would be good for Christian fiction readers though."
3,"I mistakenly thought this was a mystery thriller type of fiction. Really it is a Christian (10 more reasons why you should convert) book masquerading as detective fiction. It seems that the story line and plot are forced to try and adhere to the authors underlying desire to explain why we should all be good Christians. I found myself skipping over significant portions of the book, looking for where it would get back to the story. Not a good buy if you are looking for a detective / mystery / thriller - probably a good book if you are looking for Christian literature with a mild story to add interest. I'm sure I would have realized that if I had read a bit more about it before purchasing - so live and learn. The book ends when the Christianity issues are all dealt with - which unfortunatey is before some critical issues relating to closure around plot are resolved."
3,"Despite the picture, these are NOT Philippine Brand mangoes but are a much-inferior Royal brand. Read the fine print. Shame on this seller and shame on Amazon for allowing this deceptive sales technique. DO NOT BE FOOLED."
3,This series is ruined by the inclusion of a laugh track.......this interferes with the storylines.
3,If I could give this zero stars I would. Save your money. Bought this from QVC. It broke within a month. Wrist band popped open every time I tried to take my reading. I have small wrists 6 1/2 inches and it wouldn't stay closed. Took very poor reading when you were able to get one. Not accurate. Piece of junk. Go with an omron.
3,"I buy Sunbeam electric blankets at Walmart. And buy them. And buy them.The one I have now is less than 1 year old and is at about 30% heat from originally. I have to put a sheet, two blankets, and a comforter in addition to the electric blanket. And the room is not cold at all, maybe lower 60s.Sunbeam = perhaps not planned, but certainly quick obsolescence = junk"
3,I was so excited to have a blanket for the winter and even though parents told me not to because it used up electricity I went and did it anyway. Well they were wrong. It used hardly any electricity at all ... because it broke after TWO days! I couldn't believe it. It started blinking on me the second night and found out that meant it was defective. I was so upset. Luckily Walmart gave me full credit. DO NOT BUY THIS BLANKET! YOU WILL REGRET IT.
3,"I bought these slippers in Nov 08, the insole wore thru at the ball of my foot by March 09. They were worm and cozy at first. It was a lot of money for a short life!"
3,"The description on Amazon item page: ""Genuine shearling fleece lining delivers unbeatable warmth"" and ""Suede leather upper"". These descriptors seems to describe something that's neither sheepskin, nor real shearling.I buy several pairs of sheep skin slippers for myself and my husband every year since 2007 from Amazon. And this is the second pair this year that arrived with a woven wool lining instead of real sheep skin shearling. I'd also recently bought and returned another brand's sheep skin slippers that was lined with woven wool fabric (Lamo Men's M0003 Scuff Slipper,Chestnut). Is this what ""sheep skin"" slipper manufacturers are doing now? Very disappointing."
3,"please fix this when you click on link it takes you to some children's mp3. this has happened numerous times and is very frustrating, im surprised no one has complained."
3,"Finding this book was a very exciting moment for me. For years, I have been fascinated with the Last Tsar and Tsarina of Russia. Most of the books that I have found thus far, have delved into the family as a whole without giving true insight into each member as an individual. What I have found missing from all of the books that I have read on the Last of the Russian Royals is a picture of them from birth to death and the early events that shaped them. Reading Mr. King's novel allowed me to understand Alexandra not just as the Last Tsarina but also as a young girl and the Grand-Daughter of Queen Victoria. I highly recommend this novel to anyone who wants to learn about Alexandra as an individual and not just as Russias' Last Empress."
3,"This is better than most of Spong's works, if only because it makes more of an effort to grapple with the biblical texts. However, it once again misrepresents his opposition as much more unsophisticated than is the case. If Spong is to invoke Tillich, than his Tillich should be set upon Karl Barth, rather than Jerry Falwell. More to the point, the book never gets around to providing a real answer to the obvious question of ""If no bodily Jesus, then what?"" The obvious answers, a living body or nothing, are forbidden from the outset, so the exercise is in the end unsatisfying."
3,"To Mr. Jones:On what authority do you claim that Mr. Spong is right. It is very hypocritical to say that Christians regards God the Father as a ""bellhop"" to answer prayer requests. True prayer is the daily struggle to live in the grace freely given by God through Our Lord. As for the ""close-minded"" Church you attack, you have no right to hoist sinful, anti-Scriptural lifestyles advocated by your so-called bishop upon God-fearing Christians. True prayer is praise offered to the Lord, not prayer requests or excuses for debauchery. This book has very shaky foundations as previously ripped apart by Luke Timothy Johnson in ""The Real Jesus"". True Christianity believes in a transcendent God that holds and acts within history. Spong's ideas are falsehoods warned by St. John as the work of anti-christs. For true Christians, I recommend any book by Bishop Kallistos (Timothy Ware) for a sound exposition of the ancient faith."
3,"Monster Cable is well known for having way-overpriced products and this is absolutely NO exception. You can construct a kit like this for less than $50! All you need is any plain 10-Mbit hub and 5 patch cables. There is NO need for ""high-quality"" connectors that ""perform at 5 times the capacity of regular cat-5 wiring."" Computers are VERY good at detecting problems and fixing them, so this is simply way overkill."
3,"This book might be relevant to a mathemetician, but to a trader it gets a lot more complicated than necessary. Most successful traders that I know believe in ""Keep it Simple""."
3,"I don't own this book, and I haven't read this book, so I could be way off. But based on the two pages I read using Amazon's new ""read the page"" feature, from a mathematical/scientific perspective I wouldn't touch this with a 200' pole (for the record: I have 3 graduate degrees in physics and mathematics, including a PhD, so my opinion of this guy's methodology should carry some weight). The way he explains the mathematics and science reads like something I'd expect in an essay from a (not too bright) College Sophomore: lots of handwaving and meaningless analogy, hoping that you don't know enough about the subject (and most of his audience doesn't) to distinguish valid argument from snake-oil."
3,The tape is a very poor recording. My son lost interest because it was continually interrupted by static.
3,"Hi Definition does have its setbacks. These episodes weren't meant to be seen with such clarity, as now you can spot the seam in the background cylcorama at 18:21 in ""The Grave"", or the fact that in ""Eye of the Beholder"" the nurse walking into the room at the very beginning is not wearing any 'ugly' makeup, among many other ""flaws"" which were not noticeable before the advent of Blu-Ray or Hi Res screens... AND we're still expected to pay such a high price for it."
3,"This book is more of historycal value than for practical purposes. I was trying to find information on how to build a public aquarium with the current technologies, therefore this book totally failed to my expectations."
3,"I ordered this guitar in March.It came just as described, pretty nice deal. I replaced the strings one month later, as they started to sound weird (and I wanted to experience some brand new strings).As a beginner, I enjoyed strumming on this guitar. But the sound was not perfect. I realised that only after I tried a different guitar. Even if I was doing my best (and my friend confirmed that for me) the frets were not good.No way to finger pick on this baby.So I am giving it a 2 stars. Only because I did enjoy it in the firs 2 months, is not a good reason to consider it a good guitar. After a beginner starts to apply some tricks beside the regular strumming, you realise it is not a guitar you enjoy playing."
3,The guitar did not come with all the things it said it would. The condition when it arrived was good. However this guitar is just a really really bad quality guitar and it keeps going out of tune. Its a classical guitar but it came with steel strings instead of nylon and so it just would not make a very soothing sound. Even for beginner i would recommend investing in something better. Maybe rent a guitar if you are not sure you will stick with it. Renting is still cheaper than wasting $50 on this guitar. 2 weeks after i purchased this guitar i ended up buying a yamaha spx 500.

3,"I Bought a ZE5620US on February, and after have a lot of problems with the technical data available on site, i received a notebook with only 256mb of RAM, and Amazon's said : ""Sorry, but your sole remedy is return the product and get your cash back""The described notebook is in fact ZX5040US..Amazon is able to delete my review, every day, but is unable to correct the technical data . . .And now, i have a Celeron with just 256Mb of RAM . .The notebook performance is terrible with so little memory . .I will have to expend more 60 dollars to buy the missing module."
3,"I was very disappointed while reading this book. Contrary to some reviewers I did not find it compelling and the errors and bias rather put me off. For instance, Wilford Woodruff did not make polygamy illegal (that was the U.S. Government), each Mormon did not have to get married three different ways to make it to heaven, and one could cite pages of similar things. These could all be forgiven, however, were there a strong narrative framework with a consistent, engaging style, but alas..."
3,"The picture shows khaki the invoice says khaki but what I was actually sent is much more of a brown, and thus not authorized for wear with ACUs as these Rothco shirts are usually sold for, shirt quality is still good but the color is wrong. If it really matters what color it is I would recommend buying these at your local BX/PX or ordering it from somewhere a little more military oriented."
3,Pure Junk. Two in a row that stopped working shortly after purchased. No more Sunbeam anything in this household.

After carefully follow the instructions and put the repair under the sun for more than 3 hours, the chemical did not cure at all and the crack/chip is still there.Don't waste your money."
3,"I guess I was looking for more details on the whole process. Some chapters were only 2 or 3 pages long. I guess the authors did not deem it necessary to go into much details on those topics.For the price of this book, and if you are looking for more than a few sentances here and there on the topics, I would suggest getting a book on that specific subject. I think they tried to cover too much material in one book and it really didn't give me enough information. I should have returned it."
3,Completely agree with Lee. As it is the 8800 is a slow camera. Adding the strange contraption makes it almost useless in all except very bright conditions.Skip this product and save up for a new camera instead.
3,"I got a pair of these a while back, and although the sound quality is very good, there are several serious problems with this headset.1. The microphone goes in the same slot as the USB for charging. Many times I've picked up my headset, and wondering why the caller can't hear me, just to realize I forgot to plug the microphone back.2. Battery life time has gone downhill, and fast. It's at the point now (in less than 1 year) that I need to try to replace this battery, but I have no idea where to find this battery...3. I switched to an iPhone a few months ago, and although it works with the iPhone, the pairing has to be done every time. What's worse, it can lose the pairing arbitrarily it seems. I don't know if this is an iPhone issue, but the Motorola HT820 that my wife uses does not have this problem.In the end, I can't recommend this headset. I just placed an order for the Motorola HT820 instead, even though it's sound quality is not as good as the BlueAnt X5's."
3,"Everyone I talk to (on my Motorola RAZR cellphone) complains that they either can't hear me clearly or else I sound like I am ""talking inside a barrel."" I can hear them clearly, but outgoing audio is obviously unsatisfactory.The neck band is quite a bit too small too. The earpieces barely reach my ears when wrapped around my neck from the back (the only way it can be used).This one is headed for the junk drawer along with a few other bad choices I've made that are already there. I've kept it too long 'hoping something would get better' so it's too late to return it."
3,"Lets see where do I start:Pros: Sound is amazingCallers could hear me quite wellCons:Buttons Configuration is a little strangeWILL NOT re-connect with Phone after using Audio Streamer. (You are supposed to be able to hit the MFB & it should do this is clearly does NOT & was tested with 3 different phones by 3 different manufacturers.VERY CHEAP Plastic!!! Not painted all the way, there is part where the plastic was not molded all the way down so they are NOT sealed."
3,"I bought these and they promply broke. The Batteries are suppose to charge and be interchangeable, but it seemed one battery never worked and eventually the other one quit (less than two months) as well. The battery connection was not well thought out. I bought a set of Plantronics P500 and have been quite pleased with them. I will not buy any more Blue Ants"
3,"The product itself is good and works relatively well. It does all it promises with the exception of the battery performance. The battery has a short cycle and also a relatively short life cycle. This would not be a significant problem except that the company does not support the product. They will not send or even discuss replacement parts -- including batteries. There is no where else to buy batteries as they are special made for the X5 only - simply not available! When I spoke to the product support technician I was quickly told they do not support this product in any way - no tech support, advice or parts and have no intention of ever doing so in the future. They cannot -- or will not tell you where replacement batteries of parts may be acquired and keep telling you it is not in the current product line and therefore not supported."
3,"I purchased this lock to, obviously, protect my laptop against theft. Unfortunately, this lock failed! My laptop was locked and chained to my desk but the thieves were able to rip the lock right out of my laptop! I found the lock, still chained to my desk, with black plastic bits from my laptop around the locking mechanism. The actual laptop was long gone.I called Targus to inform them of their faulty product and they said it was only a ""theft deterrent"" and did not prevent against actual theft. They provide no warranty whatsoever for the lock itself or the stolen products.This lock is a horrible product and DOES NOT PREVENT AGAINST THEFT. DO NOT PURCHASE."
3,"I am pretty sure most of us has seen this film when it was released in 1998 as The Lion King 2: Simba's Pride, and back then, it was way better. As a couple of other reviewers have already pointed out, there are similarities between this film and L.K. II in almost every spot. Why do I give it two stars you ask? The characters were very interesting and likable, plus their voice work is very well done, but the ripped off story is what really brings this film down. Ignore this and the next follow-up Wings Of Change, and stick withe the original Balto, which is a all time classic."
3,Much smaller than expected. Chain is dainty.Not appropriate for a guy. A bigger medaland heftier chain is what I was looking for.
3,"I was unaware that this was to be downloaded to a device, and went back to read the other reviews. Evidently the download puts all the chapter Ones together, the Twos together -- and has to be manipulated to make sense. I was ordering for a blind friend and was disappointed in the product, and had to return it."
3,"The Secret Language of Feelings is extremely basic, and common sense 101. After 40 pages I couldn't take any more. Scanned to the end and didn't find anything that I didn't know. My wife was recommended it by a therapist, and I took a look. Don't bother with this one."
3,"I really like Russell Crowe and Salma Heyek in this movie, but it was just too boring to buy. I definately thought the ending was the best part though.........because the movie was over. If I could I woudl SO ask for my money back. Although the movies offers some steamy hallucenations, it's not worth the time and effort to watch movie. Trust me, DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!... Rent it from blockbuster or something....."
3,"Russell Crowe is yummy, but what is up with his accent? This is a movie to be enjoyed with the sound off, because the dialogue is very painful to hear."
3,"This is, in my opinion, the next weakest of Mr. Crowe's films that I've seen. The bottom film is ""No Way Back"".The problems, I see, with this film come from direction and lack of trust. Which could come from not trusting the director or the actors not having any time to form a connection. Since film is shot out of sequence there is an imbalance with the levels of acting on the screen. Scenes where the characters/actors are starting to finally connect and trust each other and give over to the moment are interspersed with scenes where there is no trust and it has nothing to do with the timeline of their relationship.Continuity, with the accent? Yes, it appears to be New York but at one point the conversation is about him and Australia? Onward and upward"
3,"I bought this Power Center at Amazon last year at this time. Last weekend it just stopped working. There was no surge and no storm, but suddenly everything that was connected to it turned off. When we went to check on it, it was very hot, and would not reset or turn on again. It worked fine for the year that we had it, but for the price, I expected it to last longer. The HD Plasma TV works just as well and the power is just as ""clean"" with the Belkin PureAV PF30L Home Theater Power Conditioner that I bought at Sam's Club for $29.86. Not that it matters too much, but the Belkin is much more attractive too."
3,"The item arrived in packaging looking like it had been opened prior and had been returned. Plugged it in and got a constant hum and the reset button didn't work. No power to the unit at all. The seller accepted the item as a return, no problem. I didn't have to pay for the return shipping and my entire order, including original shipping charge, was refunded, so I was pleased with that, at least. I've learned that buying electronics over the internet can sometimes be tricky, but with Amazon I have NEVER had a problem with any return."
3,"I've used this product without problems for almost 3 years. Then suddenly last night, for no good reason at all, the power running my entertainment system blinked off. It actually cycled a few times before completely powering down. I had a few things running at the time, but nothing more than I typically have sucking power. I looked behind my entertainment center and noticed the power switch light was still on. I reached to power off the switch and it gave no resistance, just a limp piece of plastic - no switch sound at all!?After some troubleshooting, checking circuit breakers and other power strips, I found the culprit to be this Monster power strip. I read some other reviews here on Amazon about this product. Most are good, but one reviewer had a very similar problem to mine - it quit, without notice, after 3 years. It could just be coincidence, but this makes me a little suspicious. Has this happened to anyone else?"
3,"I was very disappointed with this book which was sorely in need of editing! It was a laborious read at a time when I was searching for something both useful AND enjoyable! Without photos accompanying the descriptions of various locations within Albemarle County, I was left with a bland sense of what these places actually looked like. I had to rely on the power of my own creative imagination to visualize what was being presented. Architectural photography would have encouraged me to visit Albemarle County as I would be better able to recognize the sites referred to in the book."
3,"The plot dragged out for far too long, loosing my interest with well over one hundred pages left to go, and wasn't even original. The season two episode The Tower, which had aired in December of 2005, months before this book came out, dealt with the same topic of ""genetic superiority"" determining the ruling class. Also, the characterizations didn't ring true at all. Dr. McKay was made out to be stupid, and Teyla was written as judgmental and cruel. If you like Stargate Atlantis, stay away from this mockery of a book."
3,"I don't see how this title ever made it to the printing press. Nothing here makes sense. Ideas are thrown at the reader in random order, without any detailed explanations. The chapter problems are completely useless. Some assume too much knowledge of other areas of study, some try to make you apply concepts which were only mentioned in passing and no examples given. In short, I felt like I was dragged around in a sewer when I read this book.Steer clear."
3,"It's true what they say, John Wiley & Sons will publish any piece of trash submitted to them. This book is a prime example. Essentially you get a kick in the teeth and than they ask you to do completely incoherent problems. Material is difficult to follow. The problems often seem like they have nothing to do with the text. In the end, I was reduced to one of those students who memorize formulas, and do everything exactly by the book. But since most problem have no examples to guide the student, I was forced to waste hours and think them through, but half of it was guesswork and that's no way to learn. Needless to say, a simple general physics book will teach you more thermodynamics if it's written well."
3,The weight of a couple of jackets snapped off two of the arms and broke the legs. It is very poorly constructed.
3,"I bought this and at first it seemed to work OK, but after 2-3 weeks of use, it just stopped working!Since I live out of the USA, it would be too expensive to return it, so I can't say anything about their warranty."
3,"I bought this, and it broke after 9 months. I contacted Monster to get a replacement, but they refused to replace it without verification I purchased it from an authorized retailer. I was amazed that they would lose a customer (and face reviews like this) for a $10 surge protector."
3,"Monster is supposed to be one of those overpriced but very reliable brands, but here there was nothing reliable about the product. I bought three of these and all three work very badly. Sometimes the plugs yield power, other times they do not. I even have to switch devices from one plug to another in order to make it work. I would have been better off buying an even cheaper extension cord -- at least those have never failed me."
3,Perhaps my experience wasn't common but I plugged this surge protector into the outlet and within seconds smelled burning parts. Needless to say it never worked and wasn't what I expected especially overpaying for a Monster Cable product. I also purchased a more expensive Monster Cable surge protector and that is holding up so far.
3,There are too many quality power strips out there to waste your money on this one. The number of failed strips (now 12 one star reviews) is an indication of just how risky it is to buy this item. The strip powers on but there is no power going to anything that is plugged into it. Pure garbage.
3,"That's what this so-called power strip is. Like others have mentioned, I could not fit ONE plug of any of my electronic equipment into the outlets. Not one! To those who gave this product anything other than a 1 star you must not have purchased the same product because unless you want to damage the plugs on your good audio/video equipment this strip is a piece of expletive-deleted!!I was initially attracted by the brightly color-coded outlets which match my living room decor but after trying it out and finding not one well-fitted outlet, I consider myself out of $13.00 cuz you can't repackage this piece of expletive-deleted and send it back.I got a better deal from a 99cent store. Monster ought to be ashamed of themselves for selling such a piece of expletive-deleted.!!!"
3,"Epson Photo Quality Self-adhesive Sheets do not fit/feed through inject printer at all. All they do is jam up printer despite me going through great length to make sure i got a product that was same brand as my printer (epson artisan 50 series) and a product that was advertised to work with my printer. Both products, the printer and the paper, advertise working with one another and yet they do not. All instructions followed, paper size, quality set. 1 page loaded at a time only per instructions, 1 page does not fit. does not feed. if you force feed it to get it to start printing, it doesn't feed through the printer at all without force cause it's too think for printer wheel to move it.Unfortunately when we ordered this product we ordered it in bulk on assumption epson didn't lie about supported products. Here's hoping amazon will be kind enough to take all the unopened packages back."
3,"I got EXACTLY the same problem as many of other victims had experienced. All of sudden, after very scarce and gentle use, the camera only showed verticle lines and went completely blind.What is the good of a camcord if it can't even last more than 1.5 years with less than 10 hours of recording?I would say that SONY is KNOWINGLY selling defective products to consumers and all of us who had problems should file class-action law suit against SONY for damages.Any lawyers who are reading this should seriously consider this. You may reap big dollars while helping us to vent some anger."
3,"This is the first time I have ever reviewed a book on Amazon, but this book was SO incredibly awful that I just had to get my two cents in. I will admit the beginning is great. It grabs you and sucks you right in. The beginning, though, is as good as it is going to get. This book is disgusting and sleazy. The foul language is rampant and completely unnecessary. PLEASE do not waste your money on this book. My copy is in the trash, because that is exactly what this book is... a piece of trash. If I could give it a negative rating, I would."
3,"I mistakenly picked up this book in what I thought was the ""christian"" section of my local Walmart. It was right next to it. This is totally a pro choice book written to make pro life people look like lunatics. I despised the book, the topics and the language all in the name of making money. Reasons in the book on having abortions was because women were not at a good time in their life. Killing babies is never right even in a fiction book. I thought by the back cover that the dr might regret what he did eventually. That never happened. This was a waste of money!!!"
3,"I really cannot believe that this is the finished product. While I was initially compelled by the development of the characters and how they were to be involved with one another, I found the events to be formulaic and lacking orginality, the symbolism childish, and the final climax completely ridiculous in its everything-and-everyone-falls-into-place finish. This was a good first draft, but for it to be edited and published? I'm flatly surprised. I'd like to read it reworked and tweaked."
3,"The beginning of this book had me captivated. Wow, I thought, I'm going to love this. It was gripping, moved along fast, so deliciously descriptive it made you cringe with the realisam. But then it started to slow down, then got sluggish, then crawled, then became laborious, then pratically came to a dead stop. I made it to the middle and threw it down in disgust. How can anyone write such a compelling beginning and then drift into such boring drivel? The rest of the book is so different as to have been written by a differenty author. Hash words but true. The farther I got, the worse it got. I hate to think of someone reading the first chapter and buying the book based on the great beginning. You're gonna be disappointed. This is actually a dreary, tedious relationship book about some really annoying people. Who knows how it ends. I couldn't suffer that long."
3,"BEWARE of the Sony Camcorder products. I have a TRV 38 and, like many, many other people, the picture (LCD/CCD connection) went dead just after the warranty period. Do a google search on this issue and read the video forums to see the enormous problem that Sony has with these camers. There is talk of a consumer class action against Sony on this issue since it affects several of their models and they have refused to deal honorably with the problem. I will say that when it worked the camera was just great, perfect picture and easy to use. Avoid the heartbreak of finding a dead camera on your child's first birthday, as I did, and buy something else."
3,"Got this sweeper after my good old (25yrs) Sears 38"" just wore out..finally.This product is a nightmare to put together!Very poor instruction sheeet!!You have to find screws and nuts all over the box(ended up one screw short)like above reviewer..1/1/2 hours to put together!! I cant figure for the life of me how this stuipid dump feature works,so I removethe entire bag to dump..then the bag got ripped the second time on a tab welded to the frame..The only good news was the price $169 shipped to Ct.Trust me dont pay any more cause it aint worth half that!And due to the cheap materials I can expect who knows how much use from it..My advise? Buy another kind!!Update 11/18/2011..After using this (sweeper) ten times the right wheel fell off!Cant find the snap ring to put it back on!What happened to cotter pins and washers?STAY AWAY!"
3,"This book was a complete and utter disappoint, not only to myself, but to every one of my coworkers who have picked it up. Each of them has asked me, ""Did you REALLY pay money for this?""Anyone intelligent enough to understand any of these lies will undoubtedly be too intelligent to ever believe them. The biggest lie: the title.Unintelligent, uneducational, unentertaining, and simply uninteresting, this book is of no value. The sequel is no better."
3,"Monster Cables are the biggest scam in all of consumer rip offs.They do absolutely nothing as far as picture quality is concerned, and they cost a heck of a lot more than the cheap ones..."
3,"My husand ordered this item looking for a battery operated clip on fan. The description did not indicate it was battery operated OR AC, but the photo shows no cord. He ordered it based on the photo shown. Shipping and restocking fees made me decide to keep it rather than lose basiclly the cost of the fan $$ !!As to quality of the item - hey - it's a fan."
3,"I must admit that the ones listed are not the ones I would pick as favorites. That is why it has only 2 stars. The episode with Dan saving Christine's life and asking for a payback price would have made my favorites list. I still feel that this show is one of the funniest shows ever on television.I can see from most of the reviews that people would prefer season sets. I too would like season sets as I really like the show. However I will take what I can get. From what I have seen on web sites, the company was disappointed with sales of season 1. If this compilation doesn't sell well then there may never be any more seasons. So don't boycott this DVD use sales of it to tell the company that we like Night Court and want the rest of the season sets."
3,"Is there a "" I am brain dead "" sign on my forehead???? To take such a great series and do this is unforgiveable. I purchased the first season in good faith. Please do not buy this DVD."
3,"Having been a Heep fan since the mid 70's , I remember the first time I heard this on vinyl . All I can say is , what was Ken and Mick thinking . John Sloman is awful . The only decent song is ""Feelings"" . This is only for real Heep fans who need to have it for their collection . For a better Heep CD try ""Demons and Wizards"" , ""Sweet Freedom"" or more recently ""Sonic Origami"" ."
3,"I found it too flowery. I went over enthusiastic and ordered 4 bottles, now i have to return all of them."
3,I brought my pup one of this when he started to finish his Puppy Nylabone too quickly. At first he didn't take it because it didn't smell like anything. I slowly played with him with this bone and he took it. Then he just ripped them into huge chunks! He even swallowed some and vomited afterward! This are way too soft they should make it a bit stronger and add more flavoring.
3,There's a reason why these numbers weren't on any CD.They're just not good enough.A dissapointed PJ-Fan.
3,doesn't scrape any dead skin off. just smells nice and is oily but i wanted a scrub with purpose. not going to buy again
3,"I was so excited to buy this item for my Mother for her Mother's day gift, only to find it was very dry and course to her skin unlike the coconut cream I also purchased. I have submitted (2) emails in reference to the harsh item and I have not been responded to..so I do not recommend this item..although it had a wonderful aroma...Thanks Charlye"
3,"We all love Diablo, Diablo II and 3rd edition. Being a GM, Ibought this book hoping to use the monsters and treasure etc toenhance my campaigns. I expected the book to be a supplement to the3rd edition rules and allow for playing 3rd edition within the Diablogame world.This book is more of a conversion of 3rd edition into ahalf diablo/half 3rd edition game system. The weapons with tweakingcould be used in a 3rd edition campaign, but many of them seem a bitpowerful compared to those in the DMs guide. The monsters are aboutall you can take from this book for a 3rd edition campaign, but eventhat is a bit of a waste of .... Heck I don't even remember seeingstats for Diablo himself? Certainly not his brothers or anyinformation about the NPC's that assist the heroes throughDiablo.In my opinion, Skip this book and skip it fast. Spend your... on a 2nd edition module and convert it to 3rd edition. You willget more for your money!"
3,"amazon shipped a $4.00 item by express mail, which i didn't want and charged me $20.00. when i was notified by amazon of how they were shipping and how much it would cost i immediately contacted amazon that was not what i wanted and please cancel the order. amazon didn't. in the past i have been impressed with amazon. not any more. my advise is to check other vendors before amazon."
3,"These are one of the worst headphones on the market. I bought them for two reasons:1. My Phillips headphones worned out. Had them for 6 years or so and they perform much better than these Sony.2. Needed to add something cheap to my shopping cart so I could get free shipping on my order :)If you are going to use them for jogging on the streets, you might have a hard time hearing your music because of the traffic noise.They sit comfortably on your ears, however, the sound quality is terrible. Would not recommend them to anybody."
3,"I have foolishly bought about 3 of these, at various times. Each and every one of them died on me and my wife, within a few months of use. One went out within a month.Quality control is non-existent. We didn't use it rough, just the normal gym use, which is what it is advertised for.Never again. Sony, when you decide to make things cheaply, remember, it is the same name on an expensive camera as well as a $30 headphones. You lose a bit of your shine each time.I am looking at Sennheiser, Panasonic, etc now."
3,"I would rate these headphones a zero, but they actually transmit sound, so I guess I can't.First, I had to crank my Sansa Clip to the maximum so I could hear music at a reasonable level, compared to my current over-the-ear ear clips.More importantly, after 1-1/2 hours in the gym, I could not wait to rip them off my ears - I was so much in pain.Every head movement twisted these headphones, inducing another wave of pain. I must have looked like a zombie, trying not to move my head to limit the pain.I cannot understand how anyone could wear these. I guess my ears must be deformed.I guess I learned my lesson to stay away from this headphone design in the future."
3,"I was excited to use these headphones for jogging since earbuds don't stay in my ears very well. These headphones do stay in place, but after about 20 minutes of wear, they become very uncomfortable. Also, they do not cancel outside noise at all; if the gym is busy, I have to crank the volume on my iPod. I think I'll try a set of earbuds w/ an attached headband. Too bad I wasted 20 bucks on these though."
3,Whilst the book is a good and informative text i was very upset by the state of the book on arrival. The book looked like a second hand book with creases. Packaging needs to be done better.
3,I don't like this product. It is hard to focus and once done the focus does not translate to the picture. It appears that they don't share the same optics. I should have trusted my doubts about the product.
3,"After 18 month, the battery fail to keep charge. I don't even use the camera much."
3,"Recibi el estuche apenas hace 15 dias y esta descocido por los costados de la tapa. Para ser un producto de HP, deja mucho que desear.Estoy iniciando el proceso para su devolucion."
3,"This pathetic excuse for a TV show took one of the greatest fantasy series ever created and completely ignored the story for the sake of a TV show.Do yourself a favor and dont watch it, read the books instead.I stuck through the first season because it was mildly entertaining, but when the second season came along and the writers decided to make the Stone of Tears a magical stone rather than the fortress and capital of the country of Tear I could no longer bear it."
3,"My unit is Model 220 and from the pictures I don't expect the 220-1 to be any better.This tool is absolutely useless for any kind or precision drilling.Why, because the handle moves the Dremmel drill not only down but from side to side as well, due to the sloppy tolerances in the plastic castings. The downward motion is anything but smooth because of the cheap design substitute for a rack and pinion.Dremel should be ashamed of themselves for putting this on the marked."
3,"Decent product once you set the thing up. However, the documentation is horrible and set up is less than intuitive. If you are short a piece, especially a small one, it's very very hard to tell. While the tool itself seems to work o.k. (nothing special), the shoddy support for the product - even in documentation - warrants a low rating and a warning to buyers. Be prepared to figure it out and just toss the POS manual since it does more harm than good."
3,"I just purchased this with high hopes and just left a scathing review but came back to edit it after reading and following TRA's review. Because of TRA's wonderful help in an above review listing 18 steps on how to put together this work station, I think I just may be able to use this item. If you are having problems, you may want to do what I did and print out TRA's review and go through it step by step. The directions that came with this item are really lacking. I've put many, many things together and this one gave me fits.It's not the best work station and I may still go out and buy a drill press, but truly you get what you pay for."
3,"If you intend to do quality work skip this accessory. It has way too much slop in every axis. It won't hold verticle, I eventually put a drywall screw through it. You can't set a working depth and hold it. The actual Dremel tool installs with excessive tolerance.The basic idea is a good one, it has the possibility to add a number of items to the veratility of the basic Dremel tool unfortunalately it doesn't live up to the Dremel name."
3,"This book is basically a regurgitation of CFW Walther's 39 thesis work in more contemporary language. If you have read Walther, dont get this book."
3,"I remember watching this show when it aired on TV in the early 90s.I was watching this DVD and noticed most of the comedy parts where cut out especially the First episode when Melvin fell into the toxic waste, He first turned into a school teacher then a movie producer then a hideously Deformed creature of Super Human size and strength.the part with the teacher and movie producer were cut. The second episode featured a really funny magoop 83 bubblegum song that was cut from the last part of this episode. the subtitles are cruddy cause they're green and very hard to read since there was no black out line plus there were 5 episodes not 4 So don't waste your money on this cheap DVD cause it's a waste of time."
3,"I run an Eberron campaign and was really eager for one of my players to get this. I thought it would hold most of the information from the Eberron Campaign Setting book, only with the 'behind the scenes' details and story paths ripped out. I was hoping it would provide the players with a great explaination of the lands, the houses, etc., but it really falls short. The format is really strange, and I find it hard to find what I'm looking for. The information is also not nearly as useful as anything in the campaign setting book, so usually I end up just pulling information from there, rewriting it sometimes to take out details that my players shouldn't know about. Kind of a bummer, as I really liked the idea of this book."
3,"My biggest complaint about this tv is that it has terrible backlight issues on all four sides of the screen. It is gets really annoying seeing the white haze light.The only pro to this tv for me was that it outputs to 1080p for the PS3 like one of the reviewers stated above. However, it doesn't help when you are playing a game and notice that stupid backlight. Terrible, just terrible! I returned this to Best Buy."
3,"The good:Looks amazing. People tend to comment about them when they see em.The Bad:the guts are all plastic, with no way to adjust between course and fine. It does not make sense to me because I bought the brass version of this at the same time and it is a completely different product inside - metal guts, adjustable, solid.I bought the brass one for salt, and the copper one for pepper, I have them reversed now because the copper one cant handle the pepper."
3,They will take three months to ship you anything. It is made in India and shipped on their timelines. I bought May 8 and it is now leaving India months later. I am still weeks from maybe getting my furniture. Avoid at all costs.
3,I bought it from amazon right a year back. One of the way stopped working. I will not recommend this product to anyone.
3,"I see that there is no mention of Al Lowe being involved with creating this. If he is missing, then I can guarantee you that the humor and gameplay quality will be missing as well, and online opinion would seem to confirm this.What a shame that Sierra wasn't smart enough to employ him. I was looking forward to a real LSL game, not a rip off."
3,please if you have any top shelf liquor dont put it on this piece of crap. This came to me as a gift which i loved.. the plugs dont fit into the bottles unless you got bottles with super wide openings... im saddened b/c i lost some nice single malt scotch to this crappy design. keep searching and buy something else.
3,Theres a very very good reason why Microsoft doesn't do the small usb receivers...The keyboard and mouse itself is pretty decent definitely not ergonomic or anything but bearable.... however what really sets this combo apart from all the other keyboard/mouse combo's is the wireless receiver.... microsoft claims its 6 feet but I doubt its any more than 6 inches... also if you type with the keyboard on your lap and the wireless receiver is on the table then it won't register anymore....so basically what I opted to do was use a USB extension cord to hang this thing on the ceiling where the cord has to run through a lamp in the middle of my room honestly it looks more ridiculous than using a wired USB keyboard... so unless you don't mind having cables running through the center of your room and having oval chirstmas decorations hanging from your ceiling don't get this keyboard/mouse!
3,This is worthless. The lag was horrible. It was not usable. Don't buy it. I couldn't even use the keyboard to type one legible word. I should have used it to type this review out so you could see first hand what you are getting.
3,"The keyboard and mouse are not hooked to the computer with wires, but the receiver is and it has to be within a foot of the items in order to pick up their signal. So we can put the keyboard and mouse across the room from the PC, but we also have to stretch the wired receiver to just in front of them in order to use them! It almost defeats the purpose of having a ""wireless"" keyboard and mouse set.However, they do work just fine when the receiver is in very close proximity."
3,"The idea is good, but not completely thought out. The broad flat insulation around the wires plays havoc with a normal wire stripper, and if you were actually going to use all of the wire, there isn't nearly enough wall achors included with it to do the job. Being flat, it is very awkward and difficult to make a flat 90 degree turn, and the wire twists like a garden hose between anchors, instead of laying flat against the wall as it is supposed to.If you really want your speaker wire to not be seen, then it needs to be run up inside the wall into the attic and across and back down inside the other wall and wired to a speaker terminal. Otherwise, I think it's better to not pay so much, and just buy normal speaker wire that can be hidden along the baseboard under the carpet - or behind the floor wall trim, and alongside a door frame, etc."
3,"It is flat, but large. Regular 16 gauge wire is less noticeable. I would up not even using it."
3,"I found this board excellent for ironing shirt sleeves. I have many French cuffed shirts and those have several pleats which can be fiddly to do. My shirts did up perfectly like they'd come from the best laundry in town. Had wished I'd bought one years ago. Unfortunatly, my joy was short lived as after only a few uses it snapped in half! It's a cheap fiberboard which is clearly not suitable. I'm going to try to reinforce it underneath with a small narrow bracket meant for shelving. Wish the manufactorer would have done a better quality job as it's a VERY useful item."
3,"the clamp bar is misalignment with the other half, when its tighten it would not line up right and create and off set ridge, this will not create a perfect flare, so much for american made product"
3,"I cannot believe I spent money on this tape! One of the worst dance videos I have ever seen. I did not like Ms Eva Amadoris's personality. It is pissing me off when she keeps saying: ""Reina, show THEM..."" Music is boring. And who filmed this? Some amateur? Plus, how is anyone going to learn the steps if the dancers make a lot of missteps in their own choreography? I was very diappointed in this video. If you want to learn flamenco go to the flamenco class."
3,"The people who put this together are students, and I have seen many other students better than these people. They have no technique and certainly no style. They spend about 15 minutes to show some basic footsteps and then the rest of the video is clips of them doing their gigs!You got to have some nerve making a video like this. The distributor should pull this off the shelves and tell these people to go take some lessons.This is what I call an abuse of the beautiful art of flamenco.PS: I didn't buy this, I rented it from Netflix thinking it was a flamenco guitar instruction video."
3,"As a real fan of good psychological dramas, horror movies, zombie themes and science fiction movies, I thought I would check out this movie because it was recommended by someone to me. I could not have been more disappointed. This was the most slow moving, most boring and stupid movie I have ever seen this year. I only gave it two stars because I felt generous due to the good acting by the star and co-star. It is easy to understand why this movie did not do good at the box office. It should have been a clue to me why it never received much exposure. If you enjoy watching paint dry you will love this movie.Rating: 2 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Season of the Warrior: A poetic tribute to warriors)"
3,"I had high expectations for this movies but the acting did not live up to the plot. It left me saying ""huh?"" at the end."
3,"I admit it--I was suckered by the excellent trailor into wasting two hours of my precious time, but the movie itself was so boring that my family left me to finish watching it after an hour. Unfortunately, I stuck it out until the end. There is nothing--I repeat nothing, worth seeing in this movie. Good acting by everyone, but the movie stinks.Spoiler: For those of you hoping for a huge storm complete with all of the Hollywood special effects--it never comes. It's suggested just before they roll the end credits which leaves room for a Take Shelter II. Can you blame them? They know there's a sucker born every day."
3,I did not like this film too mcuh. It was too strange and you can't followthe story.The acting is great only the story line is terrible.
3,wish i could get a refund.........minus 5 stars if u ask me.....BORRING ~ PAINFUL are the two words that come to my mind first....
3,"I purchased this Culture Shock book when I moved to China for a year to teach English. It was my first exposure to the Culture Shock series. I found this book to have a very discouraging view of China and the book gave me all sorts of false impressions of what to expect. Granted, I found the book was geared more towards the business traveler than others, but I found most of the advice to be useless or out of date. In fact, I found most of the impressions which the book created to be false after only a short time in China. If you are planning on going to China, I would recommend that you purchase a book such as the Lonely Planet or Rough Guide series instead. These books give a better feel for the history and culture than the Culture Shock book."
3,"I stumbled upon this album a while ago, sitting in my collection and gathering dust. I had to laugh a little; it's probably the worst album in my collection and I was so dumb for buying it. I managed to get it a long time ago for $5, and even at that price, I wouldn't buy it again. It's that bad.They kind of remind me of a cheap version of All That Remains, which begs the question: if you want to hear this kind of music, why not just buy an ATR disc? It's extremely generic metalcore, and any metal fan would say that they've heard this a thousand times before. The album is also amazingly boring and monotonous. To this day, I can only vaguely recall one song (""The Cycle"") and that one song is probably the best on here.Disregard all the comments about how ""great they are live"", because in a studio setting, this is just a rehashing of better bands. Nothing more."
3,I've used this cover for about a year now. My bike sits outside on my front porch and is pretty exposed so I wanted a cover that could really protect it. We had a pretty snowy winter and this cover did NOT last. Right now it has so many rips and cracks that it is almost useless. Like one of the other reviewers I also found that it blew off a couple times in stronger winds. I'm sure it's fine for general storage inside a garage or other protected area.
3,Don't waste your money on this product. I have ran the screen wash program 3 different times and I do not see any reduction in the burnt in image. When I calibrated the TV (LCD screen) it seems too dark and I have to increase the brightness above the recommendated levels. Sure glad I could return to factory settings after using the program.
3,Do NOT waste your time or your money. This has got to be the worst product ever. It didn't do anything at all to improve the display of my tv. It was a very big disappointment! Thank God Amazon has a good return policy.
3,"If you know the real deal like: Kimber Kable, MIT, Audioquest, ... you wouldn't say Monster Cable ""Awesome""! Monster Cables is OK but wayyyyyyyyyy over priced (probably to pay for their mass marketing, not the technology).I currently own a pair of Monster speaker cables and they are NOT worth the money I paid."
3,"I bought these to use with my kids, but found that they didn't find the ideas at all interesting. Personal interest varies, of course. It seems to me that we have more interesting conversations than the ones suggested in the deck on a regular basis. My main issue with these cards, however, is that many of the ""facts"" listed on the cards are completely incorrect. Don't beleive everything you read, and particularly with this card deck- find out if the ""fact"" it lists is truly a ""fact"". One could take this in an entirely different educational direction than it was intended, but a research project wasn't what I was looking for."
3,"Last year I made the switch from TurboTax to TaxCut. After importing all my data from TurboTax (the box said it would,) I completed my taxes and noticed a strange bug that caused the city and zip of my employer to show up as my own! When I then changed my home address, the address of my employer changed! Good grief. I called TaxCut and they advised me to REDO my taxes and skip the import from Turbo Tax. However, after spending hours entering all my tax info, I opted to just send it into the IRS with incorrect information. It makes me wonder what other bugs TaxCut may have overlooked. You get what you pay for!"
3,"The first return I created went ok.But on the 2nd return, it kept messing up my direct deposit info.I figured out that if you try to deduct the e-file fee from your refund, it messes up your direct deposit info. If you pay bycredit card, everything is ok.Took me several days to figure this out.Do not buy this piece of crap.ML"
3,"Form navigation is poor (budget a LOT of time for a Partnership return), there are too many bugs, and you have to wait forever for updated forms."
3,"I would have to say this mantis kit was a true disappointment!!!! I would not recommend this product!!! The Kit imply's that the bugs come with it. Please understand I did not expect for the live bugs to be in the box, but I at least expected a mailer for the bugs to be included like the lady bug or butterfly kit. Instead we extremely disappointed to find a mailer to purchase the bugs for and additional $12 for a total. My grand total for this purchase was $30. Its sad the company sells a ""pop up""bug hut that retails for around $8 bucks and purchased bugs for $10 at my local garden center for a grand total of $18. This is not worth the price."
3,I bought this two years ago and it still sits in the closet. The instructions were boring and the patterns uninteresting. My daughter never even finished one. The acrylic yarn is also cheap.
3,i bought one laptop and it lasted about 10 days before it had problems( hard drive) so i sent it back and they sent me another. it worked better and for a longer time but within 45 days the hard drive was not found by the computer so when asked to return it the company said that they replaced it once and wouldn't be replacing it again.i didn't get any answer from amazon about the problem.
3,"I purchased this laptop a year ago and it didn't last more than 2 months. When I got the Blue screen of death and all my data disappeared, the computer guys explained that these people had installed XP in a system only meant for Windows 2000 or less. The harddrive got bad sectors on it and now I can only use a linux live cd to boot up. I'm still trying to get rid of this piece of crap and I recommend no one ever buy this. (I enjoyed the two months it worked by the way.)"
3,"This is silly. If you're going to use chords, you need to understand them at least a little. When you understand them a little, you won't need someone to mechanically transpose them for you; you won't need someone to mechanically list all their possible forms. What you need now (if you're considering buying this book) is to learn the principles of chord construction, voice-leading, and chord notation. You'll find these principles elsewhere. By the bye, a very good source of information about keyboard SCALES is PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns. (I recommend PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns.)"
3,Too much lofty theorizing - only for readers with little real exposure to India's complexities.
3,The 15% leg meat raised this from a 1 to a 2 but overall this product isn't very good. It has a vague crab like flavor but the texture is not anything like fresh crab. I can buy decent fresh crab meet at BJs for $13 for 16 oz of crab meat (Sam's has the same for $16) There is 4.25 oz of crab in the 6 oz can so this is cheaper (~$9/lb) but I don't enjoy eating it.
3,It is a fine looking picture. Unfortunately this is not what I received in the mail. My order was messed up totally and I ended up sending the product back for a full refund. Had I actually gotten the product I ordered I imagine I would have been much happier.As it is I have placed a similar order from a company I have used before and I do not anticipate any problems.
3,All those claims of improved reception are a joke. I plunked down over 20 dollars for a splitter that worked exactly like my 2.99 splitter. I guess I should have just taken it off and returned it but you all know what a pain that is. I'll have to chalk it up to experience.Bottom line: Don't believe everything you read. It's probably all just one scheme and sale pitch.
3,This DVD is just a malicious attack on 50 Cent. Its a sad state of affairs when a rapper has to beef to sell records. The Game needs to concentrate more on his music than worrying about 50 Cent. The DVD has some entertainment value but overall its kinda embarrasing for The Game to have to stoop to this level to destroy the character of 50 Cent. The rappers are beefing but Jimmy Iovine (distributor of 50 Cent & Game CD's) is laughing and getting all the money.
3,"THIS FOOL IS TRESPASSING ON PRIVATE PROPERTY, DEFACING PUBLIC PROPERTY FOR THE WORLD TO SEE. HOW STUPID CAN YOU BE??????HE PROBABLY DOES NOT REALIZE HE'S COMMITTED SEVERAL CRIMES ON TAPE!!!!!!IF YOU BUY IT TAKE IT TO YOUR NEAREST POLICE DEPT AND SEE WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT IT."
3,"i'm really sorry to go against the grain of the the other reviews here, but i feel an obligation to give a different perspective. i personally felt sorry for anyone involved in the making of this movie, especially the actors because the acting was soooo good. it's just sad to see such talent wasted on such a badly put together movie. besides the occasional discussions of incest, which were oddly void of emotion, there was absolutely nothing interesting or developing in the plot. There are long periods of painful nothingness, and the unrealistic and random stabbing of the father towards the end of the movie made me burst out laughing.i'm sorry if i'm not as ""deep"" as the rest of reviewers because obviously i did not analyze this long, boring, badly scripted movie, as hard as they did. good luck"
3,"I agree with much of what has been written, but somehow fail to understand how anyone could have thought that there was a supposed ""relationship"" between the teenage daughter and the filthy father. One only needs to look at the scene where the girl is desperately crying in the martello tower to see that she is in all effects being ""raped"" by her father.His loathsome and disgusting nature is cemented with the scene regarding the baby (!!) Unfortunately this ""is"" reality, and am sad to agree with a reviewer's comments that this is a ""terrible truth"" -Although I do admire Tilda Swinton and am far (very far) from being prude or narrow minded, I am left wondering whether films like this actually fuel grotesque and depraved behaviour in certain minds-"
3,"I must say that Amazon was good enough to take these unit(s) back, as neither of the two I had sent to me worked as advertised. The first unit had half of the LCD display not working (making it hard to tune), the second one didn't work, period. I suspect our friends in China were having a bad day when that batch went through...., BUT if you think about it very much, the reason you buy a weather radio, at least around here (Texas), is to HEAR the weather alerts when the power's out and a tornado might be on the way towards you...If you're going to place your life on the function of the radio, go upscale and buy a better unit in Amazon's or anyone else's line... I'd give them a thumbs up for trying, but these two were below their usual standards of design, craftsmanship and excellence and reliability.Sincerely,Kyle F. McGrogan"
3,"This was a very disappointing gift to have. The screen was defective, it didn't pick up the weather radio station - so I have returned it.I had spent hours looking through all your options, going to stores, etc, before buying it, so I was really disappointed. No replacement is needed or wanted."
3,"My son and I bought this item from JC Penney - twice. We returned it both times. Neither one worked. Okay, the blue light came on, but no radio, nothing else. We cranked and cranked and cranked and it didn't help.We were disappointed, and I am now looking for a much, much better weather radio."
3,"You can crank the dynamo all day long and the most you will get out of this thing is the led flashlight to light up. If you plug it into the wall it will get enough juice to run the radio, but that's it. Once you unplug it from the wall don't expect it to turn it on the next day because it will be dead even if you left it off and hadn't touched it. It either doesn't hold a charge or it sapps a lot of power even when not being used. This is a complete waste of money. I gave mine to my three year old to wear him down at night cranking it to use as a flashlight."
3,Very disappointed with this product. I live in an area prone to severe weather so I wanted a radio that would warn me. This radio didn't receive the NOAA channel or the TV audio.
3,"A friend from work bought a pair of these and found they were ""incompatible"" with his board. I snagged them up for $20, pleased with myself for finding such a good deal. HA!One is straight up no good, won't POST. Fails in every memory slot>The other gets me through the BIOS but fails under load. Can't get through installing Windows without page faults, memory dumps, or other general failures. An alternate stick proves it's the memory and not the system. NOT advised."
3,See Title. Wish i did get the right memory but im using it now.Not a big deal it works. but its simple a wrong delivery
3,When i received these they came in two different versions. dead and fried. I'm sure there fine when they work but after spending a month replacing motherboards and processors find out these guys were the problem and by the time i find out it's too late to take em back. so not super happy.
3,"I bought these same RAM modules when I first built my computer about 2yrs ago. I upgraded to Windows 7 about 6mos ago, so I needed more RAM. Ordered another 2GB worth and then started getting BSOD and other funky error messages about once a week. Unfortunately, I waited too long and now I can't return them. I'm currently running my computer on only the original 2GB of RAM I had when I built it and I'm no longer encountering errors. I wouldn't recommend these."
3,"Karen Bishop claims many others have misinformation, yet it would seem she does. I would not recommend this book for anyone seeking a higher path in terms of spiritual growth. She resonates intolerance and anger toward those she sees as not on her level, where most of us would see individuals simply at different levels of growth in this incarnation. I certainly wouldn't want to ascend in the manner she describes, which I think she has confused with a loving state. A view from a lightworker."
3,"Othr than the Canon brandname, the case is not a good one: (i) not enough protection, (ii) doesn't cover the whole camera, (iii) no room even for a single accessory (such as extra memory, let alone an extra batter). It's not worth it given that price. Well, if it's 5 bucks, I will have it just for the Canon-brand showoff....Get a Lowepro Z10 instead. BestBuy sells it for $.... It (i) fits my S45 perfectly, (ii) gives a much better protection for the camera, (iii) looks really cool, not bulky at all, (iv) has extra front (extendible) pocket for accessories; (v) has belt strap and shoulder strap. Finally, it's waterproof."
3,"I agree with other reviewers' sentiment about the lack of attention given to this carrying case. The Canon S70 is a High-End Point-and-Shoot. Canon should make a case that is as well-thought as their Canon S60/S70 cameras. What irks me is that they do(!). However, it is NOT SOLD IN THE USA! Do a Google search for ""Canon SC-PS900"". The SC-PS900 Canon Camera Case is well-padded and has pockets for 2 Additional Compact Flash Cards and also for a Spare Battery (which is a necessity with this camera). I got mine on eBay. I wish I could have bought it on Amazon or any U.S. retailer. I'm not trying to be racist (as I'm Asian) but C'mon Canon - sell the SC-PS900 Case in the U.S. too!"
3,"I didn't really like the book. There was only one exciting part in the book, and it was at the end. If you want to learn about Egypt, this book is not for you. It only has the names of a couple gods, not that much on Anicent Egypt. I did like the author. Look for more of her books because, the author is very descriptive. I wouldn't reccomend this book, only because the book is boring."
3,"My mature but sensitive 8 year old daughter found the book fairly good until the mention of a child's disappearance and murder. While the incident is not central to the story, it was disturbing enough that my daughter wants nothing more to do with the book...."
3,"To put it in words, I did not enjoy this book. The characters were original, the scenes were clever, but the storyline is not enjoyable. Snyder did an amazing job to make the book sound better than it looked. Though overall, it comes down to the kids in 1967 may have liked this book. The unusual events that happened in the book is my theory why they chose this book as a Newberry Award winner. If you really enjoy ancient history or Egypt, then this book may be for you. Otherwise I would not suggest it to kids, adults may appreciate this book."
3,"I liked the book, because it was kind of stupid and funny. It had a spy and other things.I didn't like the book,because it was confusing and the characters were uptight. The story was slow and you always know whats going to happen next."
3,"As stated above the buttons are lower than the plastic that surround them. I have tried to use this while wearing gloves and it is very difficult the push the button down. Also, the range seems rather short in order for the remote to communicate with the receiver (about 30 feet or less)."
3,"I bought this because I love battlefield 2, but for whatever reason after I installed it I couldn't play online due to serial key error or something like that. I don't know if this was Amazons or EAs fault, but as expected EA didn't help me at all with it so I basically threw away 5$ if you want my advice buy it on steam."
3,"This book is so dry I'm choking from the dust. Oh man what a miserable read! Where are the diagrams you would expect to find in a typical book on management. I feel sorry for the Southwest Airlines employees who were forced to use this book as a text. I learned nothing from this book. It's supposed to make you a successful manager, and help you rise to the top. Well, you know they say human waste always floats to the top...and this book was a waste of my money."
3,"I was really looking forward to this documentary but I could not watch it due to all the graphic violence that it portrays. Definitely not suitable to watch around children. If you do not like realistic murder scenes (hitting with a hatchet and blood dripping down, shown repeatedly) and realistic lashings complete with blood, do not get this movie."
3,"One of a number of novella sequels to Lovecraft plus ""The Thing"" (actually mentioned in text!) . It repeats several times over. Could see where it was going long before trailing off into completely predictable recycling of one explicit idea. Jones or Price could have edited manuscript into one of their compendia and made it worthwhile instead of hard to read. Not going to get Book II."
3,"This is a poorly written book about two great martial artists. I've been a martial artist and a Bruce Lee fan for over 30 years and have read many books and magazine articles about the legendary martial artist, and have to say this book has been a great disappointment. The book is slow and boring and I would not recommend it to anyone. Better to read one of Jesse Glover's, Dan Inosanto's, or John R. Little's books on the subject."
3,"Ok, Joanna Campbell must have gotten I little dilusional here. Since when are small children given the permission to train highly tempermental and valuble racehorses? I mean, this book is okay, but what is this? Small kids don't know what the heck they're doing. Cindy has only ridden for 6 months and suddenly she can train like a professional who has a degree and her friend, who can hardly ride, knows what to do also. I just don't like Cindy. And Heather is clueless. Cindy is running around riding this ""amazing"" horse. I'm not fond of him. If he's going to be sold, I don't think I'd let a novice horseback rider on him. Even if she was only ""walking and trotting"" him. Obviously, she intended to lie. She's galloping him. The chances that a novice galloping a high strung racehorse and not doing something wrong are low. I can't believe that they even wrote this book. It was okay, but entirely over the line. Unrealistic and annoying."
3,"This book was the worst Ann Rinaldi book I have read. She usually is such a good writer, but this book was far below her usual standards. I was very disappointed by this book and was even more disappointed when I sat down and thought about what I had just read."
3,"I'm very disappointed with this purchase. It is not even worth the money it would take to return it! It is ""bunched"" up around all the edges and doesn't lay flat for ironing. Very lightweight and cheap. I would not recommend it for purchase."
3,DON'T BUY IT !!!Socom I & II were the best ever... I mean that... THE BEST... but III is one of the worst games ever... AARRGG ! poor imitators of Valve's Counter Strike(which is bad as well... at least if you are above 12 and like the challenge of THINKING!!!)... its all about mass market.. forget the challenge of the first two games... Socom III is all about running and shooting... Zipper: either you go back to the old (good) formula) or Zip IT to YOU ! Bye-Bye...
3,"If you're looking for Sim-City-in-a-theme-park, forget it. From the moment you load the software, you realize that this is a game for young kids. Very young kids. The interface is awkward and you can't simply dive in and start building. The software keeps forcing you to take little tutorials.If you want a good theme park builder, I would suggest Roller Coaster Tycoon. It is what I thought this game should be."
3,"After having this battery for 6 months now, I have to agree with those who have said to buy the genuine canon battery. It worked great for the first few months but now the battery is maybe good for 15 minutes of usage (taking about 20 pictures and reviewing them). I've used replacement batteries for many of my electronics but this one is definitely a pass."
3,"The battery fits, charges etc., no problem. It claims a higher capacity than the original Canon battery, but I assure you that's not the case. Stay away from this garbage and by an original Canon batt - that's my advice anyway."
3,"I charged this battery for 10 hours after receiving it, but the first time I tried to use it, it only lasted for 30 minutes. It has decreased since then and now only last for about 10 minutes of shooting time. I've had it a month now and just tossed it in the local Best Buy recycle bin.Emails to the company selling it were never responded to."
3,"This product was cross merchandised with the Canon SD750, which I own, so I bought an extra battery for my camera. It doesn't fit in it, so I had to return it."
3,"cheap price, but the shipping cost is high comparing the price of the item. I bought two batteries, but I was asked to pay twice the shipping cost, which doubled my buying price."
3,"I love the band, so I couldn't wait to get the dvd. After a first viewing, I actually exchanged it thinking that I had a bad copy or something. Then I read the other reviews here that told me I wasn't hearing things with the extremely poor audio quality and metallic ""clipping"". While I love the content and the videos are very cool, this horrendous audio clipping is simply inexcusable with any dvd, especially for a band that uses technology so proficiently in its music. Warner should fix this problem and offer to exchange the bad dvd's ASAP, but of course this will never happen."
3,"I read the sample and liked the story enough to buy the book on my kindle. I wish I hadn't to be honest, what a waste of $9.99. Where the first chapter was decent, it really started to lag in the middle and toward the end. The characters were flat, the story ended ridiculously and where is the story telling? The author didn't go into details on anything. Also the magical fight scene at the end was laughable at best. I was very disappointed with this book and will not read any of her other work."
3,"do not waste your money on this piece of junk, it did not make a sound when I plugged my guitar into it and there is no 'clean' or 'distorted' so it's all supposed to be the same sound I guess. The packaging was pretty good, I will admit, but it looked like someone dropped it or something because there was a dent in the front. Don't buy this amp unless you just want it for looks (though this amp does not look good, it looks old) DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!"
3,"Not only was this game really hard, but the download prevented me from actually beating the game. The game wouldn't let me pick up an item i needed to advance in the game, and when i started the game over, another object i needed was unselectable so i still couldn't beat it. Do not buy this download! You will waste money and be very sad! I had to watch a walkthrough on youtube to find out what happened in the end. LAME!"
3,I checked this book out of the library (thank goodness I didn't spend money on it) two weeks ago and it's time for me to return it. I am on page 137 and there are 318 pages in this book. Needless to say I will not finish it. Why? Because every time I attempt to read this book I fall asleep. Actually I skipped over about half of the book. Several posters said the book it too wordy. That is an understatement!!! What really irritated me most is the constant reference to designers. Who cares? Anyway I can't finish this book because it is not worthy of the time it's going to take me to finish it. Right now you can get this book on Amazon for one penny. THIS IS NOT A BARGAIN!!!! YOUR TIME IS WAY MORE VALUABLE THAN THAT.
3,"Amazing - I read so many reviews about the paper being torn but I could not believe that it would be so consistent, so given that I could use Amazon prime I still went with this order. It was shredded in the packaging - the packaging was not torn, so it was put in this way. There were about 8 tears that went fairly deep, rendering much of it useless. It's nice paper, so I will still order the brand, but someone is doing something wrong along the way and they need to fix it. On to Adorama or B&H."
3,"I was hopping that this was the season with all discs in a sleeve of some sort. Oh well, you get what you paid for."
3,"Found nothing worthwhile in this show, except possibly the premise.Poor execution mars this badly-cheesy FX, Amanda Tappings annoying accent and uninteresting characters."
3,"If Fringe was completely formulaic and kind of sucked and was soulless, this would be Fringe if it met all those criteria and some other levels of suckitude."
3,"Maybe I didn't give it long enough. Admittedly, I've watched only five episodes of the first season, but while watching I can't resist the impulse to go do something else. The show just does not hold my interest. The characters are likable, but not in a way that makes me care what they do next."
3,This seller is great and I know it is Christmas time but I am still waiting for disk one
3,The authors are British and the work is heavily focused on British and Commowealth locomotives. Fairly ignores a myriad of interesting and innovative German locomotives.
3,"I have a test tomorrow, so I purchased ""Test"" thinking it would help me on my test. I give it an ""F"" only because I don't know what it is I just bought."
3,"This is a tedious, plodding, Doge by Doge history of Venice, with barely a mention of how it came to be created by it's merchants, bankers, traders, craftsmen et.al.The glory of Venice derives from it's business men (yes!) who eventually created an astonishing city to live and work in. They also created a method of government to keep it that way.Norwich emphasizes political history at the expense of cultural, economic, intellectual and social history. It's a dull book that stops in 1807 - as if Venice ever stopped.Fredric C. Lane's book, Venice, A Maritime Republic, is, in contrast, a masterful and readable book."
3,"I have scarcely two weeks to file my corporate business taxes, yet Tax Cut serenely says: NOT APPROVED FOR PRINTING across the top of the form. Ye gods, I can't even print out a sample form to help me file a hand-written form!This cannot be right.I have used Tax Cut (Home & Business) for the past three years because I have both personal, corporate, and trust returns to file, and the Tax Cut version is far less expensive than TurboTax, which peddles separate software for each use.Like others, I find Tax Cut for Business buggy and not intuitive, but I have previously been able to work through it. But this year's experience--not being able to print a return in time for filing--has really soured me on it.The online help is pretty shabby too."
3,"I am happy that I didn't buy this book and borrowed it from the library instead. I wanted to read this book with an open mind and get past the self promotion and really learn something about investing in real estate. But my open mind was shut with Hicks' self promotion over and over again. He encourages all to subscribe to his newsletters and buy his other programs.There were a few questions I had before I read the book: one was where to find property that would provide me with a positive cash flow. I never got that answer. I also wanted to know about where to look for government programs that give grants for rehabilitation. I never got the answer, but I'm sure that if I subscribe to the newsletter and buy all of his kits, I may learn something, but unfortunately I want to spend my time and money investing in real estate not books."
3,"Ultimately, I think if you already have a decent understanding of basic yoga, this video would be a good work out... I hope to work up to it. But if you have really never done yoga before and do not know much about it, this video is too fast and does not spend time on basic poses and correct form. I need something slower, that spends time on getting the poses right. Eventually, I think this would be a good every day routine..."
3,"This toaster is made cheaply. It takes two or three times to get the lever to stay pushed down so that it will toast. It seems like one level burns a bit while the next notch down makes it not quite toasted enough. It feels very cheap, like I'm about to break the lever each time I use it. However, there is one good feature: it allows you to pull up on the lever to raise the toast up high enough that you can pull it out without burning yourself."
3,"I bought the WD-73732 Model tv and every two years I need a new bulb for my tv. I bought tv in 6-07, then had to buy bulb 10-09 and now it went out again 5-11I have a sony rear projection in my living room that is atleast 10years old and it has the same bulb. I also keep this tv on slow warm up. If you plan on buying this tv make sure $150 is in your budget every two years :-("
3,"I rented this movie tonight and just finsihed watching it. I thought I would write a reveiw to save someone from buying this awful movie. Thank god I only rented it. Until tonight I thought no move could be as bad as ""The Jersey Devil"" (another movie to stay away from) but this movie proved me wrong. I watched the whole thing from beginning to end and I couldn't tell you what it was about to save my life. It skips from scene to scene and never explains ANYTHING. I don't know what idiot let this movie be released but he should be hunted down and tortured! Whatever you do, don't rent, buy or watch this movie. It will only make you angry that you can't get back the time you wasted on watching it."
3,"I guess it was my fault when ordering but I didn't know it was Blu-ray so I didn't play on my DVD unit hence the rating which I'm sure is way off base. I expected it to be at least a four star from me. I have the CD and have played it over and over again. Just wish it hadn't arrived as a Blu-ray. I really don't hate it as a DVD, just didn't have any other choice to write the review. If you have a Blu-ray, get it. I already know the music is great."
3,"The magazine is great, nicely formatted. But after I received the first one, did not receive the second at all. After 2 weeks, cancelled and got a refund."
3,"I was really disappointed by the quality of the articles. There is very little logical argumentation and even less facts to back those arguments up. Opinions are OK if they are coming from the guru types, but it does not appear to be the case here. Frankly, authors seem to be guys like you or me who just happen to live in the major urban center on the east coast and got a gig of writing article or two.Halfway between Newsweek and The Economist."
3,"Without a chip, generic cartridges can be bought for as little as $2.00 a piece and most places give you instructions on how to take the chip off an old cartridge and how to fool the printer. If you're going to spend more than $2 or don't have the old chip, get an original. Don't ever spend this much for one without a chip."
3,"I do love a good haunted house story.Being this one was based on true factsI had high hopes.So here is my review in two words ""Don't Bother"".I rented it then I deleted it.If you want a good haunting storygo with ""Paranormal Witness"".Don't watch at night, alone."
3,You want to charge almost $20 for a 12 minute interview that I just watched for free on youtube??
3,"This book was just so poorly written and disappointing, no wonder it's out of print!There's no new information or photos presented here (they're not even notated, dated or described), and it was a complete waste of time and money for this Beach Boys/Dennis Wilson fan.Everything from the ridiculous contradictions, cheap stereotyping, absence of fact checking, constant meandering into irrelevant subjects, insipid and elitist opinions with oh-so-lovely flourishes of anti-Americanism and anti-Semitism (real nice touch), to the glaring spelling and grammar errors - was horrendous to read. It wouldn't be an exaggeration at all to say this book is almost completely unreadable; the author can barely complete a sentence.This effort is light years away from what the Dennis Wilson story really deserves.Negative 10 stars."
3,"the fit over the rear axle isnt very good, rubs on diff.Not much louder than stock muffler.Chrome exhaust tip turned goldish in color in two days."
3,"too few illustrations, too much ""figure out the construction"", too much ""make notes"", that is not helpfull"
3,"cool look at a cool era, but even better is ""High On Rebellion; Inside The Undeground At Max's Kansas City"" by Yvonne Sewell Ruskin, loaded with NY Dolls/Johnny Thunders,Psychotic Frogs,Jayne County, Cherry Vanilla, etc THE REAL SCENE! YEAH!"
3,I have to say i was very disapointed with this necklace.It looks really pretty in the picture and i purchased this hoping to wear it to a marine corps ball.When i recieved my package i opened it up to find that it was just a pendant there was no chain for it.The aligment of the pendant was off to it was crooked and was not what i was expecting.
3,"Purchased this unit for a long road trip. Right out of the box, it looked like something was off. The colors (with all settings adjusted equally) on the 2 screens looked completely different - one of them looked extremely unnatural. After about 30 minutes of using, the sound became distorted. You could hear the dvd spinning right through the speakers, then it would change to whirring, then chattering. Overall, the package is pretty nice - nice bag, remote (that didn't work that well either), dvd player separate from the screens (I really liked this feature), but the workmanship leaves a lot to be desired. I brought it back to Target a day after we returned from our trip. Will be looking to buy another, probably more expensive player."
3,"I bought 5 of these for my family to use on a trip to Disney World. I only brought one of them home intact. The others fell apart the first day! The fabric attaching the carabiner to the metal part that goes around the neck of the bottle began to unravel before the middle of our first day in the parks. Plus the metal part that hooks around the neck of the bottle was very difficult to get on or off the bottle. The fabric strap is sort of like that used to make belts but it was flimsy and narrow. Because the fabric was narrow, it cut into the shoulder and was uncomfortable to wear with a full water bottle. I would not buy these again nor recommend them to others."
3,Quality maybe in the eyes of the beholder but only one song [Gogi Grant: The Wayward Wind] is the original recording. All others are 'new stereo records'.An artists voice 35 years after the original with a different set of musician not driven by putting the song on the chart...is going to be different. Make your choices but this stuff doesn't cut it for me.
3,"Both C-net and consumer reports .org have independently verified that there is no visible difference between the ""spiffed up"" cables, from monster, and the regular one's, from any other brand. A computer may be able to detect a difference but, the last time I checked my computer does not watch TV."
3,"This would probably be a great book to read if you are in the habit of reading a few pages here and there and easily forget what is going on. To read it a few chapters at a time is almost torture. This book could have easily have been 50 pages if we weren't reminded every paragraph that Sasha is 9 years older than Liam and he is a wacky artist and his family pushed him away and he can't be controlled and she is so very successful...blah, blah, blah. Historically, I have really enjoyed Danielle Steele's books but this is one to skip."
3,"I have read all of Ms. Steel's previous books and they seem to be getting worse as time goes on. Any author that pumps out 3-4 books a year is not spending enough time on producing a quality novel. I'm tired of the poor English usage, the incomplete sentences and the overuse of certain phrases throughout each book. If I ever have enough time and am bored to death, I will flip through this book and count how many times she uses the words ""wacky artist"". I'm certain this will be the final book I will read by Ms. Steel."
3,"This is the worst book in a long time I've tried to read and get a story out of it. Ms. Steele rambles on for chapter after chapter---and not much of anything happens!!! It's just plain BORING! About 1/3 through, the book went into the trash.After reading Nora Roberts' books, this book is abominable. It's back to Roberts for me!"
3,1. The program only lasts five minutes and it costs four dollars. So you are paying almost a dollar a minute.2. The content itself is completely inane. No good information about poker - just a silly story of how phil and the boys play high stakes poker on a plane.3. He reviews one hand history - which is K10 vs A10 and I really didn't find his analysis that interesting.4. You do not get to download the program immediately. I had to ask for it from iamplify customer service. It took a few hours. It should be available immediately.
3,"Not as good as Rankin/Bass other specials. The songs in this are forgettable, while the plot drags on (an on, an on). The film could have easily been cut a good 30 minutes, because most of the film is recycled throughout. ""Will Frost melt?"", ""Will Santa ever come?"", and Winterbolt's lame villainy. The real villain of the film is the Ice Genie. He's spooky, and practically responsible for Winterbolt's being. Lady Aurora is probably the film's only other memorable character. The circus crew are forgettable. But it is nice that Big Ben (""Rudolph's Shiny New Year"") and Jack Frost (""Frosty's Winter Wonderland"") make special appearances.Campy fun for a Friday night in July, but not the most memorable of their output."
3,"Mainly for managers, more concepts. Too much talking about concept stuff. Hard for engineers to read."
3,I got it on time but it wasn't as advertised. It is not weed less and does't look like what they show.
3,My kids love Nancy Drew PC games but this one will not download on newer computers. Our computer is a few years old and I sent the first game back thinking something was wrong with the disc. The new one I received will not download either. Very disappointed the kids can't play it.
3,This book seems incomplete and does little to help Americans with their American accents to pick up on the Polish language and its tone and accent even though it included tapes. Provides basic knowledge but not in a very good format.
3,"I bought this Sunbeam hair dryer to replace one I have had for years. Apparently some corners have been cut inthe quality of the parts. The fan blades came apart and were forced into the electric heating elements and causedquite a bit of noise. Not a good thing while one is standing in the bathroom trying to dry one's hair and holdingit six inches from your head. Purchased through Amazon from Goodman's Sales, LLC."
3,"I began to learn Japanese over 2 years ago.When first looking for interesting books to help me study, i came across this book. I thought that it would be fun for me to read and learn with colourful pictures. However, I was quite wrong after receiving this book. If you are an educated person who is trying to learn Kana, this book is NOT for you. It offers no real memorization techniques.To be honest I opened and read this book 2 times before never opening it again, it is still in mint condition.If you are actually interested in learning the Kana i would suggest:Remebering the Kana by James HeisigIf you are a parent looking to interest your children in another language, I think this book would be interesting for a child that is less than 13 years old."
3,"I bought this album at the closing of a certain store. However when I listened to it I was like this can't be The Cardigans! This album was the hugest disappointment I have ever had to face. It's not as if there are no good songs on this album such as the title song ""My Favorite Game"" for example, but there are nearly no good songs on this album. There album ""The First Band On The Moon"" was much better and this really stunk!"
3,"I got this CD few weeks ago. I did not like it AT ALL. I decided to give it couple of weeks to see if the songs would grow one. But there was nothing good I could find. Their last CD was much better, and this one should just be forgotten. 0 out of 5 stars from me."
3,"This album was terrible. I mean the lyrics were good and everything but the lead singers voice does not sound good against deep dark electronica. Maybe if they decide to stay with this type of music they could get someone else.. although I would miss her. Also this cd has the shortest number of tracks than there previous ones, and really, I think they tried too fast to put out this album. Don't judge the cardigans by this cd.. judge by there older music. ""The first band on the moon"" and ""life"" are two of my favorite cd's... and I'm into rock. But I suppose every cd has its good songs.. even if there are few. I did like erase/rewind, hanging around, and I guess my favourite game was standable. Although ""Nil"" the 11th and last track is only about one minute of piano music which sounds scary at first look but then becomes beatiful the more you listen to it. By the way I looked Nil up in the dictionary, it stands for nothing-zero. Kind of like this cd compared to there older ones."
3,"Not a good product. Recommend Sony products. This product produces ok surround sound and ok stereo sound. But the subwoofer on this item is a joke. The subwoofer face fell off as i was taking it out of the box, and it produces a distorted sound that i dont think anyone would enjoy."
3,"I have used many photo papers over time, and only a few of them have the weird perforated tab you have to remove after you print. It didn't bother me because I needed printer paper, and EVERY OTHER brand I have ever used tore off cleanly. Not this paper. 8 out of 10 pictures I print tear on one side. Easy to cut off, but very irritating, and it does affect the look of the picture as it looks like cheap paper. The tab is useless, and causes more harm than good. I can't wait to be out of this paper so I can buy the superior Kodak that I prefer to use."
3,"Purchased HP photo paper, it is the worst paper ever! Photos always sticky to the touch, it never seems to dry. Didnt even care about how color or print quality was, couldnt get past tacky feeling. Stick with Canon or Epson, I mix and match Epson and Canon paper between all my printers and its QUALITY, DRY, EXCEPTIONAL PHOTOS each time! HP is a stinker for paper!"
3,"I bought a large quntity of this paper not realizing there had been a huge change in ""premium plus"". The quality of the prints are not usable for my work now. I called HP and asked if there was any of the old paper I could buy and was told they would ship some to me. They shipped about 15 sheets of the ""advanced"" type, not Premium Plus. Very dissatisfied and must find other paper to use now. No one seemed to care at HP."
3,List stated to sell 6 batteries but only sent one and said Amazon made a mistake. Receipt also didn't included return information.
3,"I have been a subscribe to CI for many years and are familiar with their database of recipes back to 1993. It is an OUTSTANDING magazine and the finest on the market today, IMO. Then comes Cook's Country. Of course, I gave it a try wondering where the clever people at CI were going next but I think they've lost something of what made them great in this Cook's Country magazine. Over the years in CI, there have been lots of articles taking ""homey"" food and testing to improve (macaroni and cheese, turkey tetrazinni, scrambled eggs, ground beef tacos). In addition, they took lots of recipes one might consider inaccessible to the home cook and created fool proof formulas. I just don't understand what CC adds. CI is more than just recipes, it's like an every other month culinary class. I worry that CC is diluting their energies. I will not subscribe again. Get Cook's Illustrated instead."
3,"My mistake. I read the product dimensions of 8.4"" long and figured these would fit my Lincoln 1134 grease gun. These are actually about five inches long and tiny. The grease itself is fine. The product, however, is deceptively marketed here, given the price. Of course, I ""could"" insert it in the larger gun, but it leaves a nasty mess. Perhaps these are for micro-guns?"
3,"Sony created a fantastic printer. The results are even better than the typical local chain drug store's services. However, Sony has DROPPED THE BALL and will no longer supply printer paper and their proprietary SVM series ribbons, so anyone with a printer of this series now owns a very expensive paperweight. Consequently, I recommend that nobody buy the new printer advertised here. Only Sony's proprietary ribbons and paper will work in the unit. I think we should flood Sony with angry calls, so they make the supplies available. Their number is 212-833-8000. Press 3 to dial by name, and key in ""Stringer"" (Howard Stringer is the President of Sony). Unfortunately, they will connect you to their Customer Relations team in Fort Myers, FL, but if they get enough complaints, maybe they will do something about it."
3,"This is the same hard drive that comes with a gen3 i-pod. If you are like me your old drive started skipping (made a clicking noise)and ceased to play music and you are trying to replace it. After ordering this drive and installing it into my ipod the music played perfectly. Then after a week or so the same problem happened again, that darn clicking noise. I know several people who have the same ipod as me that have had the same exact problem. The only thing that I can attribute it to is that it is a design flaw in the hard drive. It is obviously not rugged enough to handle the regular wear and tear of normal ipod usage. If I were going do it all again I would buy an ipod with flash memory and leave hard drives to desktop computers. Hard drives are just not meant to travel."
3,"I am very unhappy with the quality of this photo paper. I have used HP, Epson, Canon and Kodak paper with my Canon photo printer in the past several years and never had a problem. The lines are blurry and its just not as glossy as some of the other brands. My biggest complaint is the tab, what is it for?? Another review I just saw said that it is for borderless printing. That doesn't make any sense because all other paper and printers can print on an exact 4x6 paper with no borders and with no problems! I have to fold the photo to perforate the tab and rip it off, which leaves a jagged edge on all of the photos. Not to mention, the printer is set to print 4x6, yet some of the picture prints on the tab and gets ripped off, or leave it there and the photo doesn't fit and has a perforated line through it. Not happy at all."
3,"I wish I would have read the reviews before my purchase! I could care less WHERE the paper came from, but it is EXPIRED. I tried to use it, and it is UNUSABLE. Don't fall for this!"
3,"These come in a package of 2 and look nice. I couldn't even get them to stick to the window. I tried everything I knew to try...cleaned the window, cleaned the suction cups, wetted them, pressed harder, pressed lighter...you name it. They simply wouldn't stick. If they don't stick to the dern window they're pointless. I had some previous to these (that my son destroyed) and they were MUCH better. He pulled on those suckers with all his might. He pulled the shade right off but the suction part was still suctioned to the window. Now that's a good product. I'm going to look for those again today. He's old enough to be past pulling them off now. Don't waste your time and money on these."
3,"Bought this at Walmart when my baby was born about two years ago. I am so glad for Amazon where people can share experiences b/c I was wondering if I was the only one whose purchase failed in any way to perform. It falls off constantly, doesn't cover much light anyway and YES, it is a hazard falling off like it does so near my child. Finally decided to throw it out and find another one here on Amazon."
3,"This sun shade is truly awful. I've tried to use it in several temperature conditions and it has fallen off the window every single time. Sometimes it falls off as soon as you shut the door. Sometimes it falls off after you've started driving. Either way, it's unsafe and has seriously startled our baby. It may have hit her on the way down this last time. Into the trash it's going, but first I'm writing reviews in as many places as I can to discourage other people from buying it. Munchkin needs to fix this."
3,"Short of duct tape and super glue, I tried everything to get these to stick to the windows and they will. not. stick. Complete waste of money and time. Not to mention dangerous should these hit a newborn in the face or head. Avoid this product at all cost."
3,this game is definently a waste of your time! i've played it and it is such a pain to keep changing the disks!! i had to changethe disks at least 100 times and i'm dead serious! the graphics are really bad too! the people are cartoon while the objects around them are not! I would only recomend this game to anyone who needs to kill time or waste it because i sure did!!!!!
1,Kids simply loved this little fellow.I do find the size of the smurf a bit small.Overall good quality toy
1,"As I am not enamored with the private life of Woody Harrelson, I usually skip his movies.I watched this one because I saw the trailer on another indie movie.Glad I did. Worth watching."
1,These lovely crystal earrings are perfect for daytime or dresses up any outfit for night. I couldn't believe the fine quality for such an amazingly low price. They make my blue eyes sparkle.
1,How can we read fiction and know that it can surely be true. There is no doubt that if these things are not happening now we can be assured they will soon. Albeit fiction I surely hope we have people like Jake Grafton and Tommy and some of the others out there in hot pursuit. This novel carried all the ability to keep you reading on and on. I sincerly enjoyed this one as I have the others read. I would highly recommend this book exspecially to someone that has not read Mr. Coonts in the past.
1,"I have been researching a lot on the Roman Rebublic. I stumbled on this here on amazon and i thought it was worth checking out. i spent most of my day watch and taking everything in and comparing it to similar films and HBO's Rome which i bought resently as well. Is there changes in the life of Caesar to film? Yes, of course their were. But you get the effect. You get a 'glimpse' into the life of the father of emperors. It isn't a documentary, so i didnt expect facts, only a story... and the story was well told, emotional, and generally accurate. The way i see it, if you no exactly what happened... why does it matter if a few things are reversed or if it doesn't happen in the proper time frame. Learn what you can, then go buy a documentary or read the life of caesar by plutarch.I no that i will be rewatching this often, and i would reccomend it to any fan of caesar, rome, ancient history, or a good move."
1,"I having been using Liquid Fence for a few years now. Used as directed, I find it works better than anything I've tried. I have used electronic deterrents and found them to be unreliable. With a yard FULL of Hostas, deer think the table is spread and I soon have only stems. Since using Liquid Fence the Hostas are full and beautiful; plus the deer are not harmed. WAY TO GO LIQUID FENCE!"
1,"This is a good read, very helpful. I recommend it because there is no HYPE (tripe is intestines) and simply shows how to do it."
1,"Good is good enough. I passed the 70-270 exam on the first try after reading this book and taking practice exams from two major exam prep testing software packages. Still, the exam is wicked hard."
1,"As a reader just finishing the final pages of 'Desktop Video Studio Bible', I must say I totally enjoyed it. This is an excellent guideline to starting and maintaining a business. I'll keep this as a reference for years.My wife and I have recently started a media production business on the side as presently we both work for a large computer company. I have been in the engineering related field for over 20 years. We got started in this media business at home doing simple home movies and transferring video tape. Slowly the word spread at work and among friends and before too long we saw a nucleus for a potential business. This spring we presented a surprise 40th birthday video produced by our company at a party hosting about 80 people. It was a great success and was a rush and now we are hooked. Maybe this was a peripheral effect of the ""Really Big Thing""? Read this book to find out about the ""Really Big Thing""."
1,This book is an easy read and has lots of information for new parents. It seems practical with good medical advice one can easily understand. It provides a good basic survival guide.
1,"I first read this book as a college freshman in the early 1970's and found it stunning, insightful and tremendously helpful. Now, after all these years, I pulled it off the shelf and read it again, and surprise -- it still contains the same ageless wisdom and insights and things I knew in my heart but had simply forgotten. This is a classic self-help book that will benefit anyone who takes the time to sit down and digest the material. Exists on the same lofty plateau as Og Mandino's ""Greatest Salesman in the World"" and Napolean Hill's ""Think & Grow Rich."" Outstanding book!"
1,"We go through a TON of green tea (use it for iced tea; 4-5 gallons per week), and it was always hit or miss finding it while grocery shopping. Have it on auto-ship now, and no longer an issue."
1,A great departure from conventional academic 'black box' thinking that most likely will prove to be correct as more evidence mounts over the years. An invitation to expand thinking about human origins and life on Earth and not be confined by the taboos determined by the self-appointed 'elite' of university parasites that rule scientific establishments. To be read and re-read by anyone interested in alternative explanations to unresolved questions on the dawn of humankind.
1,"In a better world this is the music I would hear when I'm shopping, or in the elevator, or maybe just relaxing on my couch on a Sunday afternoon..Now don't equate this with muzak-I just mean that this is both soothing and/or demanding music..You can listen to it while cleaning the house,just let it pass by you without interpretation or you can listen to it and if you put in a little work, it will take you places that you have never been before..This is the Jade Warrior of the Island records era, when owner Chris Blackwell,on Steve Winwood's urging offered them a contract in 1974 in answer to Virgin records success with Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells. It was their 3rd LP for Island and it stood out from the other two previous Island albums because instead of one theme throughout the album it was broken up into two themes-one for each side-(remember vinyl).It's based on Zen Buddhism, very oriental in flavor and musical consruct..This is uplifting and entertaining music"
1,"The life of Gertrude Bell is both inspiring and sad. Janet Wallach conveys the accomplishments of this woman in a way that makes one want to read on just to see what she will do next. Conversely, Ms. Bell's personal life lacks the luster of her accomplishments. From the story, I wonder if her lonliness is because she is a woman far ahead of her time or that she is just a bore. Nonetheless, the dichotomy presented in this book makes it good reading for those who look to biographys as a little window into someone's soul.This book is a good introduction to Gertrude Bell and discusses a few, limited issues surrounding the centuries of unrest in the middle east. It truly focuses on the life of Gertrude Bell and should not be used as a primer on mid-east issues."
1,"This seems petty but the author kept using the verb ""munch"". I picture her at the keyboard writing during her breakfast. Other than that, a pretty good biography. I would have liked to see more history of IRAQ covered in order to give the reader more of a context for this portion of history."
1,"Refreshing, dynamic reflection on a complex topic. For those interested in the Middle-East but exhausted by the usual wading through of endless indexes on battles; this will be a welcome change of pace. One of the few works that uses relationships to navigate through the complex web this region has become. The isolation of all parties is well told and the perspective of the telling is unique. Belle was an outsider to her own Victorian world. She never seems to come to terms with this. She spent most of her life in self imposed exile from the British system which she was instrumental in perpetuating. An intriguing character study that is entwined in the rich history of the early 1900's. Her adventures are at times both inspiring and disturbing."
1,"I like the 5 kg. capacity and the auto shut-off feature and am thinking of buying another for strictly non-food applications. However, the digital display is very dim and the numbers are very hard to read if the item being weighed is bigger than the platform, for example if they are in a big bowl. If I were to redesign this scale, I'd place the digital readout on one side, in a slanted position."
1,Huge Seth Green fan. I really enjoy the series. I would limit the audience from teens to adults. I also appreciated the price of the movie and the turn-around time on the order.
1,"Robot Chicken is awesome. I'm not sure what else to say about it. It is a show that takes a lot of work to make and the results reflect this. One thing I love about the dvd is the bonus features. The parts where Seth Green acts out the episodes are really funny.If you are a fan of the other shows on adult swim, you don't want to miss this one."
1,"Robot Chicken is the creation of Seth Green, the little guy that played the son of Dr Evil on the Austin Powers Movies and also provides the voice of Chris on the Family Guy cartoons. Part of Cartoon Network's Adult Swim these short sketches are nothing short of comedic genius. From G.I. Joe parodies which is my favorite one, to Calvin and Hobbes they dabble in a little bit of everything from past and present pop culture. If you have not been tuning in to Cartoon Network's Adult Swim and you are a fan of Family Guy Cartoons and Sick and Funny Animated Shorts, then buy this DVD and you will not regret it."
1,"Interesting commentaries help with understanding this text. Also it includes notes on the various versions of Shakespeare's play. Convenient size, too!"
1,"Amazon provided this product at a great price and it was delivered in a very timely manner. I would definitely order this product from Amazon again and recommend it to others. I love this fragrance. It is great for everyday, special occasions and for all ages. I am always asked what perfume I am wearing.Great product and great service from Amazon."
1,"Writer, Eppie Taylor, lives on a golf course. When a stray ball hurtles through her window crashing into her computer, it sends sparks flying and her beloved cat fleeing the flames that level her home. With her manuscript cremated, we learn her money-hungry agent cares far more about living high on the hog than Eppie's homeless state. Then the millionaire dot-commer that hit the golf ball enters the picture through his lawyer. When all the characters come together it sets in motion a fun, rollicking read that zips along as fast as a well hit golf ball. The agent is a hoot. Before the story ends, the flames of romance are ignited. This is an intelligent read by a writer that may also make a niche for herself as a screenwriter."
1,"My 4 year old has been begging for a ""big ball that you get in"" ever since she saw it in a catalog over the summer. So we got this one for her for Christmas and she absolutely loves it. We have a small house and she doesn't even care that it hasn't been blown up yet. She just plays inside of it like it's her little fort. Love that it can also be used in the snow in the winter. We are anxiously awaiting the next snowfall. Also loved the price - about the best $25 we ever spent for the entertainment value it's provided so far."
1,My doctor in England recommended this book to me in 2000 and its changed my life. I've not been sick since. It's the only nutrition book you'll need!
1,I have used this ruler for awhile now. The parallelism of the rule is right on. The clear plastic does not distort. The small cork circles do help hold the ruler in place. The small handles are well placed and easy to use. Could not be better.AD2
1,Everything I've made from this cookbook has been amazing! I've taken quite a few things to social gatherings and nothing but compliments :)
1,My husband and I received this book as a wedding gift. My husband is not a cook so he really never looked at it. I decided one day I would challenge myself doing 100 recipes for 100 days. I am currently using every recipe in this book ! My husband plays sports and is on a diet during the season and this cookbook is not overly fattening. It gives you the guilty flavor you get from paula deen but still healthy!!!Great cookbook you wont regret it !
1,"This product is affordable, light, and easy to clean! We love it so much. You can use it in your backyard, and you can also take it to camp ground. We're going camping soon and looking forward to using it there. Great buy!!"
1,"I have had this grill for about a month now and we use it at least three to four times a week. We have grilled chicken, fish, steaks, burgers, veggies and even peaches and at no time have we ever had a problem with smoke or anything sticking to the grill itself. As long as you always put the water in the pan and remember to spray a small amount of cooking spray on the surface you should have no problem. Also be sure to clean the top and bottom of the grill after using. I suspect some of the people that have reviewed this product and have had a problem with smoke are not cleaning it properly and old grease is more than likely causing the smoke. I would highly recommend this grill to anyone. Especially those looking to eat healthier."
1,"I like the grill, as previously stated by some it is not completely smokeless but it does cook well, cleans up relatively easy and does not dry the food out like some other well know grills do :)"
1,"I am very impressed with this neat little grill. It is large enough to cook a family dinner on and it is smokeless with the water in the bottom tray. While the drip tray is very shallow, I solved this problem by using a baster to suction most of the water out of the tray. Then it was easy to just dump the rest. If you try and move the tray without taking the water out, you will have a mess. The baster works great to take care of the problem. I am very happy with this grill and will use it often."
1,"Seriously since we have bought this product we haven't fried meat at all. We would,have thought that you can get a great tasting meat just by grilling it at your home for 20 min. Grilling is way more healthy anyways. Highly recommended."
1,"This is a super product-we have used it at least once a week since the purchase. We have cooked hotdogs, hamburgers, steak, chicken breast and pork chops so far. So tasty and healthy and really good when it is cold or raining outside! It cooks evenly and the guidebook time is accurate. The only complain is the fragile plastic handles-I dropped it and one of them broke off. I am calling the company to check on replacement since it would be easy to do."
1,"I actually got this for my wife for her birthday (along with some other, more blingy things) because she misses grilled food when the weather turns bad. We broke it out last night and I tested it with burgers. I agree with one previous reviewer that the cooking times are really long, but I'm assuming that the temperatures given are to avoid smoke and to avoid too much power draw. Anyway, it worked, the burgers cooked fine and it actually marked them fairly nicely. I miss the actual smoky, flame-cooked flavors, but a little more paprika should help with that. She likes it and it will definitely be used again. I followed the instructions to spray with Pam and the cleanup was easy and fast.One warning: Don't put too much water in the drip tray or it becomes challenging to empty without spilling."
1,"I have had this grill for about 4 weeks and I absolutely love it. I previously bought a George Foreman and the difference between them is the Sanyo prepares meat like it came from the outside barbecue grill. Steaks are absolutely delish! And the clean-up is so simple. I read many of the reviews before I ordered this and thought, ""it can't be all that!"" - but it truly is. I am so happy with my purchase. And Amazon has the absolute best price - free shipping if you don't have to have it in a hurry, I got mine in just about a week."
1,"Sanyo products, especially the kitchen variety are great. They are easy to use, safe, reliable. Vegetables are grilled to perfection, cleaning is relatively easy. Almost any grilling style (from Korean-American style bbq) works on this thing.There is ONE minus though, there are other models that provide a variety of grilling surfaces and even a steaming tray. So you may want pay a little more for a slightly more versatile grilling/steaming machine.All in all, awesome product! and for 30-40 bucks it is a great deal for yourself or as a present."
1,"This product performs as claimed by the manufacturer. Here are two details omitted from the description: First of all, the grill is quite large and takes up a lot of counter space. You may have difficulty finding room for it. And it is difficult to store because of the size. The second point is the time it takes to warm it up. You'll get best results when you allow it to come up to temperature and then cycle on and off a few times. Figure on between five and ten minutes for full warm up. These are not negatives, just information. And when you cook something you will be quite pleased with the results."
1,"This book offers an excellent overview of water collection theory. Included are a few detailed build schematics, but this book relies heavily on owner ideas to creat a system dedicated to the individual. I got some great new ideas and can honestly recommend this read."
1,"well written and illustrated, how to capture water and store it safely. Found another book on how to keep it fresh and alive ionically."

It is left to Bremen, Kinson, Mareth, Risca, and Tay to defeat a creature who calls up monsters from the netherworld to do his bidding and his army.After the druids are defeated, the five people separate. Risca goes to fight with the dwarves in their fight with the Warlock Lord. Tay goes to ask the elves to help the dwarves and mount a search for the black elfstone. Bremen, Kinson, and Mareth search for a master smith who will help create a sword that appears to be able to defeat the Brona, and the man to wield it.Can they save the Four Lands, or will the races be destroyed?The Four Lands is a huge place. It has elves, dwarves, and other creatures from the time of faerie, however, it also has trolls, gnomes, swamps, and other dangers not worth saying. It is a wonderful place filled with many dangers."
1,This is the best set of shelves for DVD's/C.D.'s I highly recomend them plenty of room for Movies & Compact Discs.
1,"pretty good, kinda expensive for what it is though. just plastic with some felt over it..."
1,"I liked it very much, I was able to do all the adjustments. I am not sure how to stabolize the stand, I am trying to figure this out."
1,"Wonderful, easy to put together, light weight fully adjustable both the body and the height. 'Rose' is going to be a wonderful help whilst sewing clothes. Highly recommended!"
1,"I love my new dress form! its just a simple dressform but very cute and functional.For me its a good purchase, considering the price and functionality, its worth the buy!"
1,"The way to my heart is though my stomach. This books gets there with delicious pizza, focaccia, bagels, white bread, challah, and paine a l'ancienne. I was disappointed with the Portuguese Sweet bread, but that's balanced out by the fact that the pizza has made me many friends and earned at least one date. If you're interested in gluten deliciousness, I recommend you get this book and get busy in the kitchen. Enjoy!"
1,The product was delivered as promised in very good condition. I just started to watch the closer in the middle of the final season. So I bought all seven seasons to get to to know the show. I love it! Sad to see it end but know I can watch anytime & I do!!! Major Crimes fan now!
1,"I need a case and maybe a second battery, so I got this Accessory Kit 2. Nice soft leather case(fasten with velcro and belt insert on the back of the case), genuine Canon battery(for my Canon SD110), and I'd say neckstrap as a bonus item since I'm probably not going to it use anyway."
1,Just got this kit - small and good leather case - the battery is dull but useful - I don't think I'll ever use the neck srap but it is nice if you like that sort of thing. Best of all Amazon's sale meant I got a case and a battery for a smidgen less than a normal battery price.If I have to be negative it is that there's no place in the case to store the battery.
1,"Raymond Carver's short stories in the book ""Cathedral"" do tell perhaps of his life's stories but there is more here. It is what he doesn't say that makes the stories so unique. It is what is left when one finishes a story...the feelings, sad or dismayed or maybe even ""I don't care"" that come from the writings but are not of the writings It isn't what he writes but what he doesn't write. It is what he leaves you with and each reader can be left with something different. Carver is one writer who can be enjoyed by a man or a woman. His slices may be short stories but they are huge slices indeed. This is a book to read when you don't mind thinking a lot!."
1,"Carver's collection is fascinating in its simplicity. The stories are about ordinary people in ordinary situations, and yet each one grabs you because you relate to the characters. Whether looking at broken relationships, lost jobs or physical disability, Carver infuses the completely human element of vulnerability. Cathedral is an honest and plain look into the human spirit and worth a read."
1,An ordinary freeway accident between two trucks during a Pacific Northwest winter. Six months later people begin dying. Attributed to the accidents but from the onset of the first symptom to the last they are all dead within a week. What do they have in common? A white waxy substance on the backs of their hands.Is in their minds or is it a syndrome on the loose from that one accidend? Are companies covering up their involvment to protect their assets?Jim Swope and Dr. Stephanie Riggs begin to turn over the stones in this suspense novel to find the answers before Jim becomes just another statistic.
1,"I ordered this book, but got another HAPPY ENDING BOOK. No biggy, it was cute too. We recvd ""Tiggy's new Teacher"" I am thrilled to even find these books at the low price I did, I had all of them at young age and lost them all. They are a classic. Quality was good. No problems."
1,"I ordered four EcoBags, one of which frayed at a seam when washed. When I related this information to EcoBags, I received an apology via e-mail and within a couple of days received a new bag. This bag withstood the wash test and I am very happy with their bags (which are a very good size) and their prompt response. I would recommend these bags to others."
1,"This is a good sized, heavy duty, but not too heavy all around cloth bag. The straps are well attached and ample in length. The company that makes them advertises 'fair trade practices' and that is important to me. They are simple, and plain, with no logo etc. I plan on using my own artwork on them down the road, so this is a good thing. (Plus I don't need to advertise for a particular store, which is what my local grocery stores are selling.)"
1,"This is a good book,an excellent read.I have many books in Fortran but i have not come across this type yet.The writing style is incredibly simple and straightforward.The authors talk in a very relaxed mode,somehow coaxing you to understanding.What more,it is written in modern style-Structured and Modular.If you ever have problems understanding other Fortran books,please try this one.In each chapter,the concluding sections on 'Odds and Ends' are invaluable.Chances are,you wont find these in other texts.However,the Fortran 90 components of the language are not explicitly highlighted as suggested by the title."
1,"This CD recaptures some, but not all, of the punch and joy that I remember Seatrain delivering live in a small D.C. club, circa 1970. For more of both, I too would love to see Amazon prevail upon Capitol to re-press Seatrain's other self-titled classic featuring fiddle vituoso Greene on a dazzling ""Little Sally Goodin / O.B.S."" that will have you dancing in your seat."
1,"These are my first pair of reefs and they're super comfortable. The only problem is that they seem to run a bit small, but they still fit fine. I love the arch support, too."
1,"These are just the best flip flops ever... I usually buy a pair a year and wear them as much as I can, they are so cushy and comfortable!"
1,"I have to pairs I payed 20.00, brown and pink It is difficult for my to get comfort and good looking shoes because my feet are skinny but I found this sandals in a surf shop 2 years ago 2005 and love them they are very comfortable, I wear them a lot and the bottom of them are worn out. I will get the same style I bought some reef for 40.00 leather top, cute but very hard and uncomfortable."
1,I bought these scissors to keep with my cross stitch. I store them in a Ziploc bag with the thread I'm using that day. Folding scissors are a necessity so my fabric doesn't get torn. I only use these scissors on thread and they work just fine. Other reviewers mentioned that they are hard to open and close. I agree that they are stiffer than other folding scissors I've owned. But for my purposes that isn't a hindrance. These inexpensive scissors serve me well and I recommend them to other needle workers.
1,Great way to teach little ones motor skills. The lights and music keeps their interest longer than if without. Durability is Great!!
1,"I have 4 boys in my daycare ranging in age from 8 mo. to 2.5 years and they all love this toy. Even when we can't find all of the stars to stack on it, they play the music and dance. It's very durable (4 boys X 4 mo. and still in good condition)."
1,I received this as a shower gift. It is wonderful! My baby girl is now 7 1/2 months but she has been playing with it for months now. She still can't get the starts back on but she loves to take them off. She also will sit and dance to the music for as long as I let her. It keeps her focus for awhile with the music and the lights. Very nice toy.
1,"My 6 month old was scared of this toy at first. When the lights would flash and the music would play, He would start to do the pouty lip thing babies do, and then he bursted into tears. Then when I picked him up he keep looking back and toy and continue to cry so i had to actual remove the toy from his sight. LOL. But after about 5 days he warmed up to it. Now he likes knocking it over and biting on the rings. Keeps him entertained. Im happy with it."
1,It does it's job. But that's about all. It seems pretty front heavy with a few CD's in it and it can be kinda hard to put CD's in this stand.
1,"All songs on this album are about Dynamite. Seven covers (""Dynamite""-Mud, ""She's Dynamite""-B.B. King, ""Dynamite""-Brenda Lee, ""Dynamite""-Cliff Richard & The Shadows, ""TNT""-Rikki And The Rikatones, ""Rollin' Dynamite""-Scott McKay, ""Dynamite""-Scorpions) in the Batmobile style and one original ""Dynamite""! The album is too short but good!"
1,"even though it's not a new release but it's excellent and well studied by Dale, it will relax you specially in very fast life style we are living, Thank you Dale Carnegie you are a great man"
1,"This is a must read. Simple common sense ideas on reasons to stop worrying about the past or future and starting living in the now. It's basic principle based ideas that help you understand why we can't change the past or control the outside world, we can only learn from the past and control how we react to the world. I've began to tell myself anytime I mess up or things don't go my way that ""you can't saw sawdust"" and try and move on."
1,"I passed both tests on my first try. Some people told me the hardware exam was easier than the OS exam. I found the opposite true. Anyway, pretty good book. The practice exams were pretty up to date, but the flash cards looked like they needed updating."
1,"What a fine little read and an excellent first book. Kansas Citians,especially us expats, will be delighted with the venue and the well crafted characters, many of whom seem so familiar. Lou Jane is really a woman for all seasons and her writing certainly reflects it. It is rather unique the number of well defined characters she manages to insert into her ""stew"". The plot line works well; she fooled me right up to the end. I bought all the copies they had at Borders yesterday (sorry amazon) to send to friends as far away as Cairo, Bali, NY and LA. Did I mention that I know this fine lady from many years back? That's why I couldn't give her a 10 which she rightly deserves for a very tasty and well written piece of fiction. Lou Jane has a three book deal with St. Martins which means at least one more after ""Revenge of the Barbeque Queens"" then, what next Lou Jane"
1,"This CD is excellent. The musical composition and the beats are refreshing. As a younger adult, I appreciate this type of music. It speaks to me and ministers to my soul."
1,"I really like this coat rack. I would have given it 5 stars, but when it arrived one of the poles was bent. Making it look lobsided. Its fine now, my husband just bent it back into place. Otherwise it works just fine."
1,"A classic funny movie duo! Everyone should see Tommy Boy at least once! Chris Farley is hilarious ""fat guy in a little coat""! Classic!"
1,"The problem with the digital or all-electronic bike speedometers is just that, they are all-electronic. The little magnet part of the sending unit is the problem. It must be precisely positioned and aligned with the rest of the sending unit and this is a pain. After much trouble with the sending unit part of digital bike speedometers I ordered this item and like it a lot. I'm thinking of ordering a second one just to have spare parts in case it becomes unavailable someday."
1,The speedometer works well and the odomter let's you know how far you have ridden. The price is definitely right but it should come with installation instructions.
1,For the first time in my life I bought 2 used books today from Amazon and they were in great condition! Like new!
1,"The ideas in this book is not new. In fact, Godin just rehashed a basic marketing idea into a very pretty book. The contents on its own would be 2 or maybe 3 stars.But why I gave this book 4 stars is the way he marketed it. He basically made his book a Purple Cow. That is what I got out of this book.I call that Good Marketing."
1,ABBA for years was thought of as the best band from sweden but soundgarden is by far the best with poppy sound and light guitar riffs. Soundgarden make no music at all on this album which I find nice because it doesnt offend me. You see offending people is down right wrong and its nice that Soundgarden is Swedish because Sweden makes really good fish. Ive been a music listener for 2 weeks and they kick [...]Swedish fish I mean. So all in all I deserve 5 stars for writing this review.
1,"95 % of this book was captivating; the characters and the plot were wonderful. While it's a cliche, it was truly hard to put down. Sara is a physician, ""girlfriend, sister, friend and daughter with each facet of her character well-drawn. However, the character Lena has (to me) a very confusing resolution at the end. It certainly makes one wait for the next book with baited breath!"
1,"What I love most about this book, is that Dadd gives practical changes that can be made as gradually or quickly as budget demands. We use alot of the recipes for natural cleaning in this book. But my favorite recipe overall is for the Ginger Soda... mmmm. As my children grow out of their old toys, almost all plastic, we've been getting them new ones that are more natural (wooden mostly). And as they are growing out of their clothes we replace them with cotton fabric. I was very suprised, as I looked at the tags in the clothes, how much of it was synthetic blends. We've replaced the childrens' and our bedding with 100% cotton and we're all sleeping better. I recommend this book to everyone who will give me the time of day! Enjoy and have safer, happier home!!"
1,I ordered this pipe i got it a few days later i have a 2005 Honda CBR 600 F4i with the stock pipe when you gave it gas it bogged down then it revved up i put this exhaust on it the same day i got it i could not believe the response of the throttle it sounds so good to i see myself putting this on my next bike to i would recommend this exhaust to anyone i am pleased all around with this product It also comes very protected
1,"First off. Ms Follman is a Spinto and sings controlled throughout all 11 cuts. The music is soothing and she would make Puccini proud. If you followed her career, you would no that Ms. Follman sings Tosca's, Butterfly's and Boheme's all over the world. Have you sung on any stage lately? Yves Abel conducts beautifully and brings alive the 88 piece English Chamber Orchestra. What a treat to have so many rare pieces on one CD. The CD insert is written in Italian and English. This CD is a great collection of wonderful Opera that has been lost and Ms. Follman had the ability to bring it back."
1,"This book commands crazy prices on the used book market, so I had given up hope on ever being able to read it, until now! This is a great time to be a sporting book enthusiast, as many of these old classics are now becoming available in low cost reprint editions. Diligent searches will reveal books you never thought you'd ever get to read! Kudos to the publishing houses who have undertaken this project to supply some very exclusive titles to those of us who don't read best sellers!"
1,I am using a 5 gallon glass water bottle for brewing. This fits very tightly in the neck. So tight it is hard to get in and out. But I guess it is supposed to be a tight fit.
1,"Cheap and arrived in 2 or 3 days. Good deal. oh more words, oh more words, need 20 to post"
1,"I was lucky enough to see The Producers when it was being previewed in Chicago. I've never laughed so hard! I preordered the CD and waited impatiently. I finally received it and have been listening ever since. When I'm unable to listen, the songs continue through my head! All the tunes are catchy, you won't be able to forget them. It's also a great way to relive the actual production until I can manage to fly out to New York and see it again. I Love It!!!"
1,"I haven't been this excited about a Broadway show since I saw Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman in ""Phantom"" back in the mid-80s. After seeing The Producers, I ordered the CD and have played it continuously for the last two weeks. I'm not sure if that was the right approach or not. I wanted all the jokes to be fresh when I saw it, but the score was so snappy and fast-paced that I sort of wish I had heard the soundtrack beforehand. What a joy! Nathan and Matthew are just unmatchable, and the supporting cast is fantastic."
1,"This film is superbly acted by the entire cast. You can totally relate to the characters. They don't portray some idealistic view of the human condition; they have real back stories and real hurts and joys that construct who they are as a person, and how they interact. The most interesting character to me is the foster mom, Signe. Her reaction to Eero's arrival seemed very genuine, and is explained later in the movie (don't want to spoil it!). Her turn-around could've been more fleshed out (perhaps much was left on the cutting room floor?) but is believable. The ending - well, I agree with others here in that I expected something quite different. So, if you leave out the last two minutes of the movie, I loved it!"
1,I've been a fan of Laurel Burch's creations for many years. All her books are stimulating. The colors and designs are large and easy to see. Laurel's color combinations are the best!!! You will get many ideas in this book.
1,For Junior to win the next Daytona race after his father died in the 500 was a moving event to all racing fans.This is the entire TV coverage of the race without the commercials.
1,"Pots work well &a re easy to use. Reasonable price,too. The brushed metallic surface does show watermarks & splodges, but is easily wiped down."
1,"Keeps water hot at least 12 hours.We use it to go to the ski slopes and allow the kids to make tea, oatmeal, and hot chocolate. The size seems large until you have neighboring people see it and gently beg for tea themselves.We get enough for four people to stay warm for a whole day of skiing.Only quibble is cleaning - it's a bit narrow at the top - but that may be impossible to solve."
1,"A delight to behold, the photographs are exciting and the layout of the book makes the reader want to touch and hear all the instruments described. The CD is an added bonus for lovers of world music."
1,"I bought a German version of this. It is very coloful, easy to follow, and includes how to do introductions, learn your colors, numbers, animals, and a lot more. Includes many songs and games to make it easier to learn. Wonderful for children and others. Includes many pictures and fun facts about the country itself. Excellent!"
1,A good collection of different problems and situations in Bombay. Excellent blend of writers.
1,I love this CD. Batmobile makes really good psychobilly. Dead (I Want Them When They Are Dead) is my favorite song!
1,"I think Duane and Kelly Rowlands both did their thing in this film. It was an enjoyable and tasteful film about true love and how people can connect during the strangest moments. Kelly is truly a beautiful and talanted woman, and I wish her the best in life. It was simple, but good, and once in a while we need films like this to escape horrid films like that Killer cam movie...what was he thinkin. But I truly did enjoy the seat filler. I laughed and smiled."
1,"I thought this movie was DAMN good. It was a pleasure to watch and very nicely directed. Kudos to Kelly Rowland. This was the first time I've seen her in a movie and she's done a wonderful job (Others may disagree), but who cares.Nicely done"
1,"This movie was your typical Boy Meets Girl, boy falls for girl, girl dumps boy, boy makes a fool of himself and wins girl back story. But what made the movie good was DeRay Davis. Yes Kelly Rowland and Duane Martin were good and had great chemistry but DeRay was hysterical. He added a great sense of comedy to the movie. One thing that could have been added was more lines for Kyla Pratt, she is an good actress and would have brought a nice dimension to the movie. But all in all this was an enjoyable movie and I would recommend it. Hats of to Will, Jada, Duane and Tisha for creating the Momentum Experience it is definately much needed in the African American community to see positive love stories that don't look like they were made on a low budget. This film definately had the look and feel of a ""real Hollywood movie"". Oh yeah Shemar Moore was definately funny in this movie."
1,"Unfortunately I can't find it in any stores anymore! It's only online.Rich, but the cinnamon is not overpowering. Not chai."
1,"I gave four stars because I can't understand all very well although I am just at the beginning. Probably it is because I am absolutely new to ASP and Internet programming, but it helps me. I hope in several weeks it'll be better."
1,"I listened to the unabridged audio book version, read by the author. It was very moving, hearing it told with the author's accent. I think anyone who feels they did not quite ""fit-in"" with the norm would really enjoy this book."
1,"I have read many books..fiction and non-fiction on the Holocaust. Stones From The River is written from a very different perspective. This is a book about of the coming of age of a non-Jewish woman who is a dwarf, born in Germany before WWI. Hegi writes with incredible insight and so poetically, that I wrote down several of her lines for my own personal reference. She offers the perspective of a child who becomes an adult living a life in a glass box during a time when to be different..whether Jewish or gay, was on constant display. She wrestles with differences from how people perceive her and how she and others face a very judgemental world full of persecution and ultimately death.This is a book I couldn't put down and I highly recommend it."
1,Stones From The River is an interesting and thought-provoking novel. This story tells of a small German town during World War Two and chronicles the various hardships the town goes through when the town's citizens are torn apart based on their views of both Jews and the newly formed Natzi party. Told from the perspective of a dwarf girl living in the town this novel portrays a viewpoint rarely experienced by American readers (that of a non-Jewish as well as anti-Natzi). Through this story readers learn about the hardships German citizens experienced after World Wars One and Two and how keeping silent only slowed the healing process for this town and its people. Although the book is a bit to long and takes a while to get interesting it is a wonderful story that is both entertaining and educational.
1,Really liked the book - good recipes and easy to follow. Noticed a difference in my skin. All about eating the right foods.
1,"I love this CD. I have listened to it on a daily basis. Without ever addressing the cause of the trauma, Belleruth Napartsek addresses issues that people with PTSD deal with. Her imagery helps the listener to relax and get in touch with their body. She leads you into the inside of your heart and suggests that someone loving and helpful is with you. There are also affirmations included. I find myself looking forward to listening every night. It is like listening to a kind friend soothing me as I fall asleep. I highly recommend this CD for anyone dealing with PTSD."
1,"As an acupuncturist I found this book to be a really lovely synergy between the Flower Essence indications and the properties of the Chinese Qi Meridians. The design of the book itself is beautiful; the little green corner at the top left of the cover is inspired. Although I enjoyed reading the book I was dubious about clinical applications, but have been more than pleasantly surprised. Using essences on the prescibed sites as an adjunct to needling has yeilded quite good results in some sticky cases. The method is also a wonderful and convenient way to work on oneself. I await Volume II."
1,"..stands up to abuse and easy for dogs to p/up on the ground, flies straight even in high winds. this product is also durable and will stand up to moderate chewing"
1,This was a very good review of beginner sign lagnuage. I take this book with me everywhere I go and it's a quick reference with accurate hand movements w/ch is always helpful.
1,"The item came in timely manner, however it was sold as 'new' and did not come packaged as new. It was just in a clear zip lock style bag. I can say that the item works just fine and I'm satisfied with the purchase. I cannot give a five star review due to the item being sold as new but not being packaged as new."
1,"Pretty impressed with the blade. Not very sharp but sharp enough to cut through the sheath which is where my problem was. Trying to put it back in the cloth sheath and it stabbed straight through turning the sheath into trash. Needs either a leather sheath or a hard wood scabbard being preferred. Other than that, love the design and very pleased once I sharpened the blade a bit."
1,"its very nice, came sharp... the sheath is still bad quality, but not quite as bad as i thought it would be. and the grip (basically shoe laces) on the handle slip and slide around, but other than that is is a very nice full tang sword:)"
1,"great tool, now i can convert all of the vhs tapes of my kids growing up and all their activities to dvd."
1,Have had no problems. Don't be in a hurry when inserting vhsc tape into it and you won't have problems. Had bought a software program to transfer to dvd. Have done a dozen tapes so far so good.
1,This show is a good one to watch if you wanna see the inside of a twister. I enjoyed it all the way through. Brilliant!
1,This is a fabulous way to experience the Odyssey. It was meant to be (and originally was) oral. This is a wonderful translation read by a truly great actor (and great reader). Gripping! I highly recommend this version. Good for older kids too.
1,"First of all, this book was a great addition to my knowledge. I have read a great amount of books.......well this one tops them all. Yes, it was hard to understand...with the big words and all...lol, but I managed. To anyone reading this I think that this book was monumental, tragic, inticing, and at some points boring. That is why I think you should buy this book...add to your knowledge. Go on it won't hurt you.Author of this review, Michael S. Cartee"
1,David Kusumoto has given such a wonderful and helpful review here. I have little to add except that I loved this book. I have read it once and listened to the audio tapes 3 times. Just saw the movie. It is a book to be savored.I wish I could have read David's review first.
1,"I read this book for a school assignment. At first I thought the book was rather dull and dense with descriptions, but as I read further, I grew to like the book more and more. Many of my classmates also felt the same way. I liked the book mainly because it was different from all other Civil War books. It gave a new perspective to things. It told the story from different points of views, views that aren't normally looked at. I found that very unique and interesting. The guy in my class that would never read any of the books our class assigned or at least never finished them enjoyed the book and finished before everyone else. I admit that the details are a little difficult to bear but that just adds to the book. I really enjoyed it and think you will to, just be patient... If a high school student can be patient with it I'm pretty sure others can too."
1,"I am a 13 year old who read this book for a school project. I was looking forward to reading it because I heard so much about it through not only my teacher but through many newspaper articles, but when I started the book I found that I enjoyed the parts about Ada better than Inman. I just have to say that this book WAS NOT what I expected. I didn't really enjoy it. But that might be because I didn't understand what was going on. If I were on the National Book Award comitee I would have a hard time finding this as the Award Winner."
1,"This book is fascinating, brilliant, beautifully written, and has one of the most disappointing endings I have ever read. I won't tell you what happens, but, after carefully developing Inman, and putting him through a series of life-threatening adventures, Frazier simply betrays his character -- as if he discarded a logical ending for a more ""literary"" one. I'm not someone who believes a book must end in a certain way: happy endings, sad endings, even ambiguous endings have their place; what I don't like are wrong, illogical endings. In betraying Inman, Frazier also betrays his readers' trust, and the affection for character and author that has developed by the book's end.I've had discussions, and arguments--good natured ones, of course...--with several people about the ending. Those who love the ending are adamant in their feeling, while those who hate it are no less fervent. Still, I highly recommend this book."
1,"I am realy coming to appreciate the modern trend to approach historical fiction from the standpoint of the small, personal history rather than the large, sweeping saga. Cold Mountain takes you down to the grassroots of the Civil War, a view you won't find in Gone with the Wind. (no offense intended - I enjoy those epic novels as well!) Frazier's language draws clear pictures that draw you into his protaganist's journey. I actually had no desire to see the movie, as the book had been so well brought to life in my mind by Frazier's words."
1,"It took about 40 or 50 pages to get used to the writing style of Mr. Frazier. But after that it read very easily. Don't stop because it is different. If you decide to read this book, finish it, you will be in for a real treat. What a story teller. I hope there are more great stories where Cold Mountain came from."
1,"Cold Mountain is one the best love stories ever written. It compares with Bridges of Madison County and The English Patient. It is also a war story and brings to light tragedy and death as we will never know. I highly recommend this book. It is not an easy read, yet very worthwhile."
1,"If you haven't read this magnificent novel, I envy you. It is truly one of the most fascinating, rewarding and enriching stories you will ever read. I rarely reread a book, but have read Cold Mountain three times already. I think many people miss the humor contained in this book, focusing on the journey of both Inman and Ada and their trials and tribulations. There are a few scenes that are the most hysterically funny situations ever written. Yes, you will need a box of tissues, but not just for the sad parts. A film will be made in the future of this wonderful book but there is no way any film can capture the beautiful magic with which this story will entwine you."
1,"I will admit that it took me a few tries to get past the first couple of pages, but once I did, I was hooked. I simply could not put the book down. This is not a book for people who are looking for action, or a quick, non-comitted read on the beach...this one takes some concentration. It is pure poetry. I would read a page and go back and reread it because the language was so captivatingly beautiful...I could not get enough, and I didn't want to miss a thing."
1,"What a beautiful book! It's really a modern epic that depicts a man's quest to go home after deflecting from fighting in the Civil War. The story is told from several perspectives, from both the man who left home and seeks to return and the women left behind. Everyone is seeking to rebuild their lives amidst the chaos of the war and is drawing strength from strong memories of the past and hope for a better future. The emotions evoked for me were those of longing, regret, hope, and love. This book gave me such a gratefulness to be ""home."" If you are missing the good old days of high school English class and are craving ""literature"" rather than plain ""fiction,"" this would be an excellent choice. It is a transporting novel."
1,"This book is a fabulous reading experience. The Civil War (or any war, for that matter) is so much more than who shot whom, when, and where. War CHANGES people, but there are some things that don't change even in the context of the most insurmountable odds, and to understand that is to ""get"" the point of this story. The ending stunned me to the extent that even days later I found myself forgetting that I hadn't read it and wanting to finish it to see how it turns out. Then I would remember - and my reaction was a bit like what Ada's might have been even during the time of the last scene in the book."
1,"Thank you Charles Frazier. Cold Mountain is possibly the most impressive book I have read in many years. I almost don't want to start another book right away because I want to savor Cold Mountain just a bit longer. Every detail was perfect. The research so well done. Inman, Ada and Ruby jumped from the pages and into my heart. A wonderful reading experience."
1,"I haven't bought this item yet, but I've heard it, and I really like it. The main track, Biology, is catchy and was the first Girls Aloud song I heard. They're addictive, aren't they!? Anywho, I noticed a B-side, Nobody But You, which I listen to contstantly on youtube, and I love it. Its a slow song, but still within their style, and not a ballad. I also found the Tony Lemezma Remix, which is a new spin on a good song. Hearing a new melody makes the girls' vocals stand out, like hearing it again for the first time. It totally comes recommended if you enjoy Girls Aloud."
1,"Gabby ""Pops"" Pahinui (Phillip Gabby Pahinui) was absolutely the greatest Slack Key Guitarist that ever lived.Many folks consider him to be the father of the style. Any title with his name on it is a Must Have item for the Hawaiian Music Lover. Gabby was a state road crew worker by day and an incredible guitarist, singer-songwriter by night and weekend.Ry Cooder lived and studied with this man and his family in the 70's.To see Gabby in person provoked instant Chicken Skin (goosebumps). Gabby left us in 1980 but fortunately for all of us, three of his sons - Cyril, Martin & Bla Pahinui all continue making fine music and extending the family legacy.Anytime you see a cd with the name Pahinui on it, grab it...you will not be sorry. Pahinui, like Mercedes, means absolute perfection. - Rabbett"
1,"Another amazing band that is back [...]. Awesome riffage, great vox and just awesome music."
1,I saw originaly saw this movie in the theater when it first came out an it's just as enjoyable now as it was then. If you don't get it for yourself I do recommend getting for your kids. I believe that the real Space Camp is still operating today. I wish I had gone when I was a kid.
1,"If you love Space Camp, this will bring you back to the old-school space camp days. It is a very unbelievable experience that would never happen, but it is interesting to see the kids pull together to get through their problems."
1,"This is a great FAMILY movie to watch. It teaches a great lesson in how very important team work really is and how each person is vitally important to accomplish any goal at hand, otherwise, all would be lost."
1,I bought this movie for my son. I loved this movie as a kid so I knew he would love it. I was right. It kept his attention all the way through. I would suggest this movie for anyone who loves space.
1,"I remember watching this movie when I was about 8 years old, thinking it was the coolest thing I'd ever seen. Aside from Flight of the Navigator, of course. I probably watched it a million times. Now, my 9 year old daughter is heading to space camp in a few months. I all of a sudden remembered this movie and instantly had a strong desire to watch it again, with my daughter.Yes, the plot is unbelievable, corny, campy, whatever. But it is a fun movie that your kids (10 and under) will love. It's one of those movies that's great to fall asleep to on a rainy Saturday afternoon."
1,We use this at our wildlife hospital for extra vitamins for the avian patients we get in. Good product; nothing bad to say!
1,I'm long overdue for a review on this. I love the Wild Berry Zinger tea. I've tried some of the other ones but this is by far my favorite. (I did not like the Red Zinger at all! The peppermint flavor overwhelmed all the over berri-ness!) The price I get for this compared to in my store makes it a no brainer to keep on buying it from Amazon.
1,"I bought a copy of this book at a used book sale over 20 years ago, and still have it. It's a piece of living fiction...it's a brave book for its time, talking of past lives and being fully believable at the same time. If you can find it, READ THIS BOOK!!"
1,"Sal Arico has a very calming voice with powerful lyrics reasuring us of our faith. It's a very relaxing cd for the most part. You can practically fall asleep to this one, in a good way :)"
1,"Mr. Ziglar is simply amazing. He is consistently motivating, inspirational, and right on in all that he says and writes. Truly a national treasure. Every bit of his offerings help me to do, as he says, ""what I ought to do when I ought to do it"", so that I will be able to do ""what I want to do when I want to do it."""
1,"Very good book with plenty of examples. For readers of the previous 2.1 version of the book, it clearly indicates what's new in 2.5. Very good description of the new RECORD and STREAM objects and their use with XML."
1,"This book is a brief autobiography of two major figures in 20th century philosophy, both before and after the only time they ever met (the eponymous poker incident). I have a big interest and a pretty solid background in western philosophy, so I was familiar with most of the names mentioned in the book. Anyone who was not, however, might find this book much less interesting to read than I did, since much more time is spent explicating the story and the temperaments of the participants rather than discussing their ideas in any detail. The best part about this tale is that it places European philosophy in the rather ugly context of 20th century Europe. A fascinating read for anyone with the background knowledge to really get into the story."
1,Well written and a fun read though your life will still be complete without having read this book
1,"I found ""The Violet Flame"" by Elizabeth Claire Prophet to be a spiritually and metaphysically deep book that provides useful information on how to heighten your spiritual vibration.The cleansing exercises, and information about the violet flame are very helpful & effective and can lead to physical healing. What I like most is that these exercises can be applied at the personal, community or even global level.I highly recommend that you read "" The Violet Flame.""Even better read together with an excellent spiritual New Age novel about transformation & healing called NEXUS by Deborah Morrison & Arvind Singh."
1,This is a really good story. I feel weird because I never could stand more than 5 seconds of American soaps. Gorgeous latin women!My first Spanish soap was called ROSALINDA and it's awesome too!
1,My dog loves these rubber toys from JW-- they're always his favorites. This is a very durable toy and has a more muted squeaker which is great for us because he squeaks for him but isn't as loud as the Cuz balls which squeak VERY loudly at first.
1,"This is a very good DVD player. I have used now for some weeks, and tested it with Progressive scan as well as the interlaced mode. The picture quality is sharp and vivid with no traces of any artifacts, edge jagging etc. Without wasting any one's time, I would say that if you are a perfectionist this is the DVD player for you."
1,"The main reason I bought this DVD player is that it can play CDR disc as well. It surely is fun to load in your own CDR disc loaded with MP3s or VCD movie. The picture and sound quality is very good, better than the Panasonic AU120 model I had before."
1,"This is NOT somebody tampering with a classic. I put it in my car stereo and from the first drums fill on ""Hello, I Love You"" i could hear the clarity of the remix. It's still the same songs you've come to know and love so don't have a cow or anything. The only differences in the voclas aside from the clarity is that sometimes you hear Morrison scat-singing to himself during a solo or interlude of osme chatter in the studio. It's a classic rock album redefined with a clarity of modern day equipment. It doesn't sound like it was drowned in reverb like was the style so ofter in that era, but is actually clearer and more distinct and ultimately satisfying to the ear.The different versions of ""Not To Touch The Earth"" have a second slightly slower version in which the lyrics are almost read rather than sung and a third version excluding the guitar fills and, of course the long version ""Celebration of The Lizard""."
1,I too think this is one of the Doors's best albums. I was dissappointed when they didn't put Love Street on the best of.
1,"All of your reviews that I have read describe the unit in glowing terms - BUT IS IT CABLE BOX COMPATIBLE & does it have a RELIABLE, EFFECTIVE COMMERCIAL ADVANCE???? - The reviews don't addrees these high end features even though I am almost certain that all the VR-650 series units have these capabilities."
1,"Again, Dr. Peale outdoes himself in this incredibly motivating and inspiring book. Everything you need to manifest success in your life is contained within this book along with real life examples of the miracles of positive thinking and belief in ones self and creator."
1,"The absolute best NIN album since Downward Spiral. Verry creative, verry industrial, ...I love it!"
1,"The track ""In This Twilight"" is a real highlight of this album. You absolutely have to check out the video Jennaphoenix made for it on YouTube. It is titled ""NIN - In This Twilight - music video visuals"" (Not to be confused with ""Nine Inch Nails - ""In This Twilight"" Movie Music Video"" by Editsbydan, which is similar but not nearly as good in my opinion.) Jennaphoenix's collage of images of various apocalyptic movies is quite powerful and fits the song perfectly."
1,this is the best NIN album since the Downward Spiral. the tracks are sick and the words are powerful. it makes you want to get out and do something about the sad state of the world. trent is amazing as always and i would recommend this to new fans and old hard core fans. i cant wait to see how this gets done live.
1,"The first time I listenend to the CD I was like ""what's going on??"" But the more I listend to it the more I liked it. Its a Brilliant CD. A defenite must for every NIN Fan.."
1,"This was one of the most touching and exciting stories I have ever read. I never put it down once I read it, and I read it in a few hours. It is about a seven year old boy named Georgia Burgess who is being abused by his mother and her boyfriend. I think that person who gave it one star, misunderstood the plot completely, and I completely disagree with what they said about this wonderful piece of literature."
1,Great read...I think a must read. I bought these books as spare copies as I am always recommending it to friends and colleagues. Was delivered quickly and as promised.
1,"We have a 1.5 year old yellow lab. He is wonderful and knows to only chew his toys... BUT he is such a strong chewer that we have only found 3 toys that last more than five minutes (black kongs, the supertough Nyla Bones (which require supervision as plastic shards come off), and these). When we get the octopus toys we cut off the nubs at the bottom and then he can play with minimal supervision. There is a squeaky-thing inside so we keep an eye on him when he starts to chew through the rubber, but that usually takes awhile.Also, the shipper sent the toys very, very promptly."
1,"Peter Dickinson is one of my favorite mystery authors, and this may be his best book, less because of the mystery than because of the multidimensional, reflective protagonist, a leftish grandmother caring for her grandson while seeking a richer life. The mysterious deaths are nevertheless puzzling [and weird, as usual in Dickinson] and clues for their solution emerge in surprising ways. Admittedly, the web of relationships is a little far-fetched, but their variety lets him comment strikingly on British sociopolitical life in the early 1990s. All of his books might be called social science fiction: he creates very original contexts and then lets the interaction reveal implications as it works itself out. This book is unusually intricately developed; it's a very good read, sometimes suspenseful but more often gripping due to its intriguing creativity. It's a shame this book isn't more available and more frequently reviewed here."
1,The book was a good read that went quickly. Interesting plot line that kept my interest up. I would recommend it.
1,"Very cool book. Page turner, had a exceptional twist. Would recommend to anyone who likes a good espionage would liken it to The Borne Identity."
1,for anyone buying this cd many surprises await them.stripped down versions of the slider album mix with acoustic versions. imagine the slider without the strings or flo and eddy.perfect for the hardcore bolan fanatic thirsting for more unheard versions. very good sound quality. not just trying to bilk you out of your money with some cheap ripoff.buy this cd.
1,"I just received this cd after not hearing it for some 20 years. I remember when I had the vinyl album (yes, I'm that old) that it became one of my favorites. Well, I wore that thing out and having moved a couple of times kind of forgot about it. But then I came across it through Amazon.com and just had to get it. I'm glad I did. This is a terrific cd. Nothing outrageous, but instead music to relax with and you can sort of mellow out. Listen to it in your car when your taking a long drive. Very relaxing. It'll bring back some fond memories as well. John we hardly knew ye'. RIP."
1,"I'm not a fan of Jennifer Weiner -I've read a couple of her novels and for the life of me I don't get the hype about such a mediocre writer--so I had very low expectations about In Her Shoes, despite the rave reviews. I'm happy to say I was wrong. This is one of those rare cases in which the movie is significantly better than the book. The characters seem real people, beautifully portrayed by Toni Collette, Cameron Diaz and Shirley McLaine--the three of them, at the top of their game."
1,"This was one awsome movie. Drama, emotions all the way. I would recommend it for purchase. The story is great, it shows real life struggles. Everytime I watch it, I enjoy it like the first time. Real nice."
1,"All I really wanted was a 20oz mug and this fit the bill. I haven't figured out how the lid works. Are you supposed to be able to drink with it on? If so, how? If not, why bother with a lid? But it was the cup I wanted anyway."
1,purchased this mug based on previous reviews and I'm happy with it.I use it to cook oatmeal in the morning and the size is just right.Large enough for those instant oatmeal packet and the handle makes it safe to carry as the rest of the mug gets hot. Would recommend this to others.
1,"Don't you just hate it when your cereal flakes & pasta noodles can't stay in your bowl because the bowl's just not deep enough? Well, you won't have that problem with this mug -- 20 ounces is just the right size for those of us who like to hold something by its handle and eat in front of the TV without the food sneaking over the top rim onto your lap.We never snap the tops on the mug for warming or re-heating, so can't opine on how well the little blue tabs will hold up upon constant usage. For us, it's better to place the top at a slight angle to allow the contents to vent while heating, and the tops are lightweight yet heavy enough that they stay in place.One word of caution -- with this large a mug, the contents tend to get cooler much quicker than a traditionally-sized mug, so you may not want to dawdle over your meal or cuppa :)"
1,"Have had these for over 5 years and just purchased two more.I use them, mainly, for my instant oatmeal in the mornings.It works great for that application. Have also used it forreheating soups, veggies and other dishes. I understandsome dismays from other reviews about the lids staining andtheir food overflowing in the microwave, but it sounds likesome are reheating them longer than they need to. I usuallyreheat soup for 2 min, then take it out, stir it, and put itback in for 1 more minute. 99% of the time, it's perfect."
1,"I like this item, I use it every night for refrigerating two cups of coffee for the morning.. The lid is a tight fit and easy to work with. I found it annoying that a label that was glued to the top left a residue that hasn't come off at all. I'll have to stop everything at some point and try to find out how to get that to clean up, it looks awful."
1,This was my first lesbian fiction and how sweet it was!!! It's been a long time since I read a book wanting the experience to last forever Bliss went through situations that every woman has faced leaving us with the feeling that we'll never find love and happiness again. This is a must have in any lesbian library. I really enjoyed this book and you will too. Fantastic read!!!
1,"If you need to fulfill your craving for love, lust and lesbians Fiona Zedde is the answer. Bliss was great!!!! I am an avid reader of lesbian fiction and this novel was amazing. Romance, realism and hot sexy moments that catapult you through this story of a woman's search for love departing from heterocentricity to one of taboo!!!A MUST READ!!!"
1,"I bought mine about a week ago, and let me tell ya, this amp is all that I'll need for years to come. I don't see a reason to even need another amp. It's so clean. I play I'm an experimental band, so we play a variety of styles. This amp definitely has versatility. Also, it doesn't take up a bunch of space like my stack does. You won't be disappointed buying this product. Related artists (Dance Gavin Dance, The Dear Hunter, Maybeshewill, Circa Survive, This Town Needs Guns, The Mars Volta and so on)"
1,I knew very little about Irish history and found this to be a very good general survey. Each chapter is written by a different historian and the best are truly excellent. It whet my appetite for more depth reading on several topics.
1,"Item fit in the dash of my '97 S10 just the way it was supposed to. I bought this model because of the storage cubby under the radio. I thought I would be giving up the stock cubby when I put the radio in, but as it turns out, I now have 2! This product did not come with the trim ring which had to be bought separately from Kenwood, along with the DIN sleeve. The S10 dashboard was a friggin' nightmare to take apart and put back together, but this product worked as advertised."
1,"First let me say, this is not a measuring cup, this is a measuring bowl. It is a very large and convenient size. The bowl is about 7.5 ins across and 5 ins deep. I love it, its great for a variety of measuring, mixing and microwaving.Glass Pyrex measuring cups and bowls are perfect to measure your ingredients in and then just pop right in the microwave to heat up. The perfect way to make cook'n serve pudding or instant potatoes. The open handle is great to hold onto while mixing and also great to grab while removing hot ingredients out of the microwave. The handle doesn't get hot in the microwave. I have the 1 cup, 2 cup, 4 cup and the 8 cup measuring cups in Pyrex. They are great. I love the durable glass instead of plastic, so no worries about bacteria, odors or chemicals. The markings in red are easy to read too. They are also made in the USA.Highly recommend. This one is one of my favorites."
1,Ordered this Naylabone for a strong chewer!! It is holding up pretty well and is greatly enjoyed! This is a much better cost then I can find at any of the pet stores around our area.
1,"I've always had good luck with Nylabone products. My dogs absolutely LOVE this one, though. I think breaking away from the bone shape that they are used to really stirred their interest. Can't beat the price you get online, either. I'm sure this would be twice as much at a pet store."
1,"I am so happy I made this purchase, my dog loves it. She takes it everywhere. She doesn't over do it with the chewing,but that's because I always make sure she has different options available to her to keep her entertained. Please remember that when giving a chewing toy, you are there to supervise, it's all trial and error, it works for some and not for others. This is a good toy, keeps her entertained and off my door frames!"
1,One of my first albums I bought as a kid. I still love it after all these years. It holds up as one of rhe greats. Melodic synth music.
1,Used this to switch my 1973 Monte Carlo over to electronic ignition. Works great and starts like a dream. Only downside isit can be a pain in the butt getting the screws in. I dropped them countless times which lead to some major frustration.
1,Pretty novel idea. Seems to be strong but not too strong so its not overkill when youre concerned maybe about a young cat like me.
1,"I received this toy about an hour ago via UPS. I got all excited in front of my Pug Dog, to see what he would do, he also got excited watching me take it out of the plastic wrapping.Well he could not wait and grabbed it before it was all the way out. When I did let go he went nuts over it. Now my dog is in no way deprived of toys he has a few large bags that I rotate. This little duck or should I say large duck is beautiful. It is solidly made and is just perfect. The squeaky does not work as well as I had hoped but I can replace that with not trouble I do it all the time. Not enough to take away a star.When my Buddy started to play with it I can tell how much fun it is, he even tossed it high in the air, that never happened before. They are both resting now, the playtime is over and it is lap time. Tomorrow will be another ducky day of play. I would not hesitate to recommend this toy to everyone...."
1,THis is my favorite knife ! I am so glad i bought this instead of the chinese made bear grylls one. I haven't found the limit on this blade yet. Cuts through anything. I have used it for chopping and as a wedge. The handle smashes nuts and can be used as a blunt instrument with ease. The sheath is durable and has a few different configurations. I was even impressed with GERBER and the help i got with a few questions about it before i made the buy. Very happy
1,I Bought this used. I received it quickly and it was in good condition when i received it. The book itself seems like an excellent too for the use of learning Spanish.
1,Love the show..cannot go wrong no matter what the age. Max is a riot!Where is their parents though?Peace out Max and Ruby!
1,"This product is great. I've been having some problems finding stuff like this where I live, when they were always readily available before. I've been using it for several weeks, and I have to say it leaves hair very soft and shiny. Hair has stopped falling out and looks very nice. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to take care of his/her hair. It is a great product. And shipping was super fast!! Gotta love that part also!"
1,"What's disappointing about this workout plan is that the ""Power 90"" DVD cardio section is the EXACT SAME workout as the ""Beach Body Power 90 Sweat"" VHS tapes I got from a friend a 6 years ago (same people in the workout, same clothes, same moves in the same order--they just recycled footage from the previous set of VHS). The packaging is different, and the DVD is more comprehensive than the VHS was (DVD includes Ab Ripper 100 and Circuit 1-2 with resistance band workouts), but I was disappointed that the cardio workout isn't updated at all. The circuit portion annihilated my lower body-such a GREAT workout, and despite not being updated, the cardio portion is decent. I like Tony Horton because he's a little cheesy and very friendly without being irritating. The set also comes with a calendar, measuring tape, another DVD set of workouts and resistance bands, so I feel that the whole package is worth the money."
1,"This CD is one of my favorites. I love his version of ""Mary Did You Know?"" and ""Merry Christmas with Love"". This CD gets a work out every season."
1,"A focused look at the evolution of fundementalism in the three religions established by the Children of Abraham. Ms. Armstrong surely knows her stuff, and the reasearch that obviously went into this book supports the information that's offered in an easily understandable manner.As a crimnal justice trainer on volatile groups and terorism, I suggest this book as a foundaton for anyone trying to understand the attitudes and beliefs of radical and or militant sects within those religious groups."
1,"My neighbor is from the Virginia area and is one of the dearest people I know. She loaned this book to me at just the right time and when I had nothing else to read. I was so wrapped up in it that I sobbed at the end; not only at the loss of such an amazing man Bob Childress nor at the awe inspiring effect he had on the scots-irish fighters of Buffalo mountain, but simply because the book was over! I knew for certain that my recovering alcoholic husband, who happened to be born in West Virginia, and who turned his own life around in an amazing way, would be even more profoundly moved by this book than I was....and I was right."
1,"I don't understand all the bad reviews. It's easy to use, works great on my android device with Kindle app and on my computer.The original publication date is 1871, so if you need a dictionary that hails from a time when we didn't stare at screens and self induce ADD, this will probably work for you. Granted words like email, telephone, bubble gum, and virtually anything else invented after 1870 won't be included."
1,Yeah all our farm tractors are RED so this sign was very appropriate. Some of our neighbors are GREEN so this is great for a jab here and there !!
1,"The drama of John Webster is characterized by themes of revenge, misanthropy, misogyny, villainy, murder and ultimately violence. Webster's play, The White Devil parallels a modern day soap opera in which the plot keeps readers on their edge with its numerous twists and sub-plots.I had doubts about reading Jacobean Drama, but once I picked up The White Devil, I was hooked. I was especially intrigued with the duality of the heroine Vittoria. In Vittoria, Webster offers us a character we love to hate, but finds ourselves pitying her, perhaps even siding with her.The White Devil is certainly a play worth reading."
1,"This is just a little FYI for people who keep bringing up the ""day on bridge, night when they walk off"" thing. First off, it wasn't like 1 P.M. when Magneto lifted the bridge, it was near sunset. And, I guess if you havent watched a sunset, you wouldnt know that it goes from sunlight to darkness rather quickly. I just wish people would think about stuff before they start complaining about it."
1,"I saw the first X-Men movie, missed the second one, and just saw this one. I'm not a huge fan of the comic books so any complaints that others have about the weak characters doesn't apply to me. I still think Halle Berry is a pretty flat actress so the fact that Storm had such a huge role in this movie was a big drawback for me. But other than that, I thought it was good. It was action-packed and entertaining the whole way through, which is all I was looking for. If you're a huge fan of the whole X-Men franchise, I've heard from friends who are Marvel devotees that this one was a disappointment. However, if you're just looking for a night in with a good movie I think you'll be pleasantly entertained."
1,"I am not a comic book expert, nor do I know much about the X-Men beyond the movies. I can say that the third installment lacks some of the depth of the first two, but so what? It's a joy to watch. I watched this with my son, and we both had a similar experience. It's wonderful with surround sound and the visuals are quite stunning. There are a few intense moments that may be a bit much for small children, but overall the pace is terrific and the characters engaging."
1,"Xmen III is one of the best movies ever!!The intense battle between the different philosophies of Xavier and Magneto is at its peak in the last Xmen movie The Last Stand, a tale of survival. This movie emcompasses all genres such as politics, action, romance, comedy, drama, horror, etc...this movie has something for everyone!From the politics of the Cure, to the forced suppression of the Dark Pheonix of Jean Grey, the internal conflict between right and wrong surfaces throughout this thought-provoking movie. Not only is the storyline beautifully philosophical, the actors and actresses express their emotions with perfect intensity. With the perfect combination of story telling and presentation, one can understand both perspectives, whether it is for Xavier or Magneto.This movie is nothing but perfect."
1,"People were warning that Brett Ratner's involvement in the series would send the entire Marvel universe down the drain. Personally, I found about as much to enjoy in the third installment as I did in the Bryan Singer-helmed first two. Sure, there was a palpable focus on two characters, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), but they're probably the two most interesting characters! Shocker! I certainly hope they don't end the series with three films - I am not a big X-Men fan, but I thoroughly enjoyed all three - great special effects, interesting plotlines, and memorable characters. Put those things together and you get a great popcorn flick, albeit with enough drama and character development to keep the non-fanboys interested."
1,The quality of the picture at 1080i is really incredible compared to 720p (a widescreen DVD). Some blu-rays have poor encoding and you don't get the benefit of the additional pixels in the picture quality. This one is an exception. A popular blu-ray review site rated this disc one of the best.
1,"Great movie a must have on blu-ray. I love all the X-Men movies. Magneto is the best, and of course i love mystique."
1,"This movie had great action and special effects. Some people don't agree that this movie was good becuase of it's comic book history. It's your opinion but not a fact. This movie focuses on the characters and their abilities more. The first two movies were boring and not that much action. This one goes over the top. X-men is about action, excitement; this movie shows that.The only reason why some are upset is becuase of the major deaths that was taken place in this movie. I enjoyed it. Watched it seven times in the movies."
1,"Amazing is one word to describe as this film but grimy is another.About the goverment coming up with a cure to make mutants become regular people, make mutants feel affended. So the mutants battle it out to stop the cures. And of course the leader of this all is guess who? Magneto of course. WIth different sidekicks, they battle out the good X-Men. SOme get hurt, some turn into regular humans and a lot of them die.Now this one was very different from the first and second. It had more deaths of the main charactors and they trash talked alot in this one. It was a very good movie, but we notice that we loose alot of good charactors in the story, which kind of blows. But for everyone who likes X-Men, you won't be disappointed."
1,i totally love my bio-electric shield and i don't now how i functioned without it. it really makes my energy stronger and i feel more blissful & balanced. i never take it off except to recharge it in the sun. it is also a great asset to anyone who does energy work.
1,Plot: A group of rich college students set off to their heiress friend's island mansion on April Fool's Day weekend. Everyone's playing pranks on eachother and its all fun and games.. at first. After docking when everyone gets to the house is when the real 'games' begin.Someone is killing their friends. Who could it be? Is it one of them or is it the boat captain who took them? It's 'ok' for the first half hour then things start to get interesting...This movie had me fooled. I was sure it was going to be just another typical horror movie where I could figure out who did it.. I was wrong.. It has a lot of humor to it. The twist ending was good and made the movie. It had a Very 'different' kind of twist at the end than most horror movies. Recommended.

1,"One of my roommates got this puzzle for Christmas, and we unwittingly threw out the instructions with the packaging before even attempting the puzzle.Days later, we were about ready to give up and use the thing as a paper weight, when I finally managed to get the thing apart. Then, yes, *then* came the frustrating part. Trying to put it back together, without the instructions. Because, you see, while there's only one way to take the thing apart, there are uncountable ways that you can try and put it back together.The pieces could be found all over our apartment for months to come."
1,"This book is great. I normally don't read non-fiction as entertainment but this is definitely the exception. Hillenbrand's terminology is excellent. She uses the everyday ""language"" of a horse person. She explains the ""language"" so that non-horse people will understand yet keeps the explanation from being redundant for readers who are horse people. The movie is also excellent and really stays true to the book. Both the book and the movie are awesome stories of second chances and the power of someone believing in something."
1,"It took me a while to get thru the first part because the author writes about the history of the owner and the jockey. It got interesting when I got to the middle of the book. The book is full of old photos of Seabiscuit and some of his races. I actually cried during some of the sad parts. I just wished I was there back in the 30's so I could really see Seabiscuit in a race. I was never a horse lover, but after reading this book I realized what a great horse Seabiscuit was and what a true American hero he was for people back then. I'm glad Laura Hillenbrand wrote this book so Seabiscuit would not be forgotten."
1,"I truly enjoyed this book for the joy of the story. I get to read so few books for fun (I read a lot in connection with my work) and this was fun. I've recommended it to many of my family and friends, and the book is now in circulation among them.It was extremely engaging and well paced. I was able to read it over the course of two weekends (fast for me).Thank you to author Hillenbrand for introducing me to this wonderful sport and wonderful story. Yes, horseracing is now in my book as a sport, thanks to this author (I pooh-pooh'ed it before). And, indeed, Seabiscuit and his jockeys and trainer should go down in the annals of sport as one of the greatest athletic teams ever."
1,"Seabiscuit is a great movie, so I decide to read the book from where the movie was inspired. It was a good decision, the book is much better and has so many information about the history of the horse racers. It is a fast and fascinating reading.I recommend it. Do not miss this book."
1,"This book is fascinating, even for a person like me who knows nothing about horse racing. It is well researched and very well written. Ms. Hillenbrand does an excellent job of developing the characters to the point where you come to really know them as the people they were, and her ability to fill in the details of life as it was in the Depression-era US justs adds a great context and backdrop to what is, in the end, a great 'underdog' story. I became intrigued about this story after seeing the movie, and the book was everything I hoped it would be."
1,"This is a page turner full of historical context woven seamlessly into the story about the brutal reality of horse racing, while focusing on Seabiscuit--an unlikely hero of a horse whose energy would lull before races. This book rivals In Cold Blood as a nonfiction narrative that reads like a novel."
1,"What a great work of non-fiction! I first thought this was just some over-hyped movie: over-hyped director, over-hyped crew, and that the storyline would be bad. How wrong was I! This book captivated me from start to finish. I am amazed to learn what life as a jockey as like. What they do to their bodies, all for very little recognition, is unbelievable (and not quite healthy, mind you). I like how the authors weaves historical details throughout this book, and the fact that this book takes place during the depression is of key importance. It is also a very uplifting story: what can happen when you really set out to accomplish something. Another great work of non-fiction that I enjoyed - at least if you're a guy - is Make Every Girl Want You by steve reil."
1,Makes you think you can do the impossible when you read the story of such unlikely characters creating the greatest horse in history. You just can't make stuff like this up!!
1,"This was a dynamite book!!! I could not put it down. I believe that the story would appeal to those folks who are not ""horse-people"". It is such a story of heart, courage, and love. The telling of the races was so vivid I actually felt like I was watching them, hearing them, feeling them. Well done Laura!! It makes me appreciate the 2 horses off-the-track that I am lucky enough to own. Read this fabulous book and then go hug your horse."
1,"I immediately became hooked on this book. Every time Seabiscuit exploded down the homestretch, I became giddy with joy. He lived such a long time ago but the legend still lives on of the little horse who was so small, but had such great determination and heart that he never allowed himself to give up, that is truly what made him a champion. Thanks to the author for sharing your amazing talent and letting me read an incredible book about an incredible spirit."
1,"Robert Hughes tries to position himself somewhere in between Karen Finley and Jesse Helms in his essays about the politics of art in America. The result is that he comes out about where the Supreme Court has found itself in June 1998 -- linked to Jesse Helms anyway by critics, despite trying hard to distance himself. He apparently thinks Karen Finley is a fraud, and that's just not what the art crowd wants to hear. It was courageous of Hughes to write the book, which contains the seeds of ""American Visions"" (also worth reading)."
1,"This CD isn't only technique - it's merry, a frolicing good time. Props to ""Field Day"", a song from the POV of cops busting an anti-war march in LA, turning it into a riot. ""And if you're pregnant, I'll kick you. Because a pregnant one counts as two."""
1,"I made a 6 ft bench but added a center brace to the front and back 2X4's. I also used a short aluminum strip screwed to the center back rests. I placed 28"" 2X4's under the feet on either side to keep legs from going into the ground. a great product. I recomend having the 2X4's cut when purchased.I cut small blocks to put under seat slats."
1,"Product looks great and strong. Disappointed with the ""hardware"" part of it. Hardware is in fact small #10 screws. I thought it was going to be bolts and nuts.Because it is for a school, I am hoping that these screws will hold the benches together.Perhaps company should be clearer on the ""type"" of hardware used.Will continue my review once benches have been in used for a while and see if the screws hold."
1,"Bench ends come with hardware. All you need is lumber, saw and a drill. The ends are sturdy and handle year round weather- in Delaware, at least. If you have a piece of wood that is weathered, etc., simply replace it."
1,"This poncho does everything they say it does. I like it, but it is really awfully heavy & hot in warm weather rain. I would say it is well worth the money."
1,"Get into your personal parenting relationship, even as you were a mere son and didn't have a clue about what your parents were doing"
1,This book gives directions to all the Forts mentioned. It gives much info on the people who lived in and around them. The very short stories of each Fort makes for reading and then picking up again to read about another area.
1,I really enjoyed reading this book! The author does a fantastic job of letting you know how Tory feels! This is my personal favorite!
1,"My '99 4 cyl. Toyota Tacoma has been a superb little workhorse and fishing buddy (trips to the dump, hauling camping gear, etc.) and has never needed major engine work. Within the past few years, however, it began running roughly and would ""stumble"" when accelerating, even though I'd stayed on top of maintenance.Our local mechanic indicated my fuel injectors may eventually need to be replaced, but in the meantime he recommended Lucas injector cleaner. Simply put, I couldn't be happier. Most of the acceleration issues have cleared up and it's definitely running more smoothly. I didn't buy it looking for increased MPG efficiency, so I don't have any insight there. I'm so impressed with its sheer ability to reduce noise and smooth things out, though, that I'm buying in bulk to use regularly with my truck and my wife's '02 Subaru.Strongly recommended."
1,"I was referred to Arsis by a friend, who knew I was looking for things to do to pass the time 'round the D.C. area. I threw the CD in and gave it an honest listen. The vocals were ish- standard death metal, with the high black metal screeches. Nothing special there. The drums were very repetitive, with the drummer rarely alternating beats or paces. Again, nothing special. The bass was blended into the background well, giving it a subtle, but definitive sound. But the guitars... well, holy hell! That style of rythym guitar should not be possible! Excellent indeed! It's great to see good metal coming off the east coast, especially from Virginia! 4 stars out of 5, because I'm still not thrilled with the vocals or the drums (the drummer's fast, but not complex. I'm spoiled on crack-head drummers.)"
1,I purchased one gallon of slime to use with my Polaris Sportsman. Buying it by the gallon was the right decision and it was priced right.
1,this is the best nibbler i used and i use a lot of brands easy to use cut well .will buy another
1,Solid introduction to the topic and fairly easy to read. I was concerned about being overwhelmed but the authors have taken time to make a difficult subject available to the average Linux SysAdmin.Lots of information for embedded dev's coming from other Operating Systems! If that's you then the authors suggest havingRunning LinuxandLinux Kernel in a Nutshell (In a Nutshell (O'Reilly))available while you work with this book.Definately a good read! Minor issues are the slight wordiness in places and the lack of proof-reading here and there. Embedded systems skills are gaining popularity and you can get some hands on working with a minimal system and trying out the stuff in this book.
1,"He forgot about Between Me & Youand... instead of the original, putting the Remix with Lil' Mo.. which made the song so big...What happen?(Possibly get Can I Get A... ) also..."
1,gives enough light to be effectivesoft warm lightused them for years and keep re-buying them(need more words to submit)
1,"The reason I chose this power supply adapter is that if you experiment with other simmilar power adapters you may end up either damaging your gadget(s) or having undesired results. In my case, I had tried simmilar power adapters with my rp-50 unit, but many of these would get some kind of annoying noise through the circuits. So far I have had no problems whatsoever, the sound coming out of my unit is clean because this is the recommended power supply; recommended amperage and volts."
1,"I bought this keychain for my boyfriend who is currently stationed in Afghanistan. Great for travelers who want to carry a piece of home. It is an unbeatable price, holds 60 pictures, and the battery life seems great. Very user friendly, plug it in and load photos. MAC COMPATIBLE. The key chain is super light amd for $10 it cannot be beat, The picture quality, however, is not as great as in the product picture. Great going away gift for troops. Overall, I would recommend this for anyone lacking a smart phone who wants to carry a number of pictures."
1,"I ended up buying one in every color, and so did my co-worker. They're cute, easy to use, lightweight - just all around a neat little toy. I'm using several as Mother's Day and Father's Day gifts."
1,"This was a gift, the person I gave it to loves it. It's small enough to go anywhere, but holds just the right amount of photos. More than once I've been told thanks."
1,"I bought this for my mom, who loves pictures. She is not very computer savy but she loves it. She said it was real easy to install and use."
1,i didn't have high expectations for this little thing but i update it with pictures of my 20m old daughter to take to show my mom when we go visit..she wears reading glasses and even agree's its a spiffy little thing...i bought her one and my bf's father one to show off the granddaughter...both love it and its simple to use.
1,"This is easier to carry in your bag than a bulky photo brag book. I can easily change or rearrange the pictures stored. The pictures are clear, although I would like them bigger, but that would defeat the purpose of a small viewer to keep in your bag. I do not keep it on my keychain, but could see who the clear veiwing screen could become scratched if you do. I would also like to be able to go to a specific picture with out going through them all."
1,"I got this product and was so pleased with it, I got another one for my daughter-in-law. I love the quality of the pictures and now can show off my granddaughter where ever I go! Thanks Pepsi!"
1,Good envelope: holds things. Good paper: looks clean. Good adhesive: stays closed. Very good price.My young daughter will love the sturdy box when the envelopes are done.What else do you want to know?
1,This was a funny movie and a love story with a very happy ending. Yes I would recommend this to anyone wanting to watch a love story.
1,"From beginning to end, the human voices of this phenomenal group will lay their hands on your soul and raise it a little closer to heaven."
1,"I received these bulbs as a present... I installed them and they showed off the kitchen in a much brighter, colored manner. I love them. I also installed them in the bathroom. They're great."
1,"Before Johnny Dowd and the Chicago/Bloodshot guys were tearing through and tearing up the iconography of country music, there was Lee Clayton.Jet pilot turned country music singer, Clayton's straightforward, unsentimental phrasing conveys his dark, strange songs very well. He takes gospel, bluegrass and blues images and he stands them on their heads, with strong and authentic effect.These two records are an excellent introduction to a songwriter's songwriter. Buy these and you'll want more."
1,Great item arrived before time and was just like the description said. I would buy again but sadly didn't need the book
1,"The Fratenity Of man is another one of the great unknown bands from the 60's. Elliot Ingbar is a great guitarist, was the original lead guitar player in the Mothers Of Invention, played lead on Freak Out! (1966). He has been kicking around the LA music scene since the early 60's played in some surf bands and made some memorable recordings. This is the SECOND Fratenity Of Man album, and the first ne is just as good. Elliot is also known as Winged Eel Fingerling from Captain Beefheart's Magic Band (most notably on The Spotlight Kid)."
1,"I bought this for use with a 96 s10 blazer and it worked great, it took a little bit of wrestling around to get the factory plug into it, but i would it rather be tight and stay in there than be loose and fall out! also an added plus of this- is that the antenna wire that comes stock is pretty short, and this thing adds a good few inches for easy stereo maneuverability when installing/ uninstalling a new deck!"
1,"When I went to install I found another, hung up in wiring harness. I like to keep at least one of these on hand. Someone is always asking me to install a radio or system. Perfect for GM when installing different from stock."
1,I've tried other oil filter and they worked just fine but I personally like to use the factory oil filters since that's what the owners manual request to use for better car performance. Also at the price Amazon is selling it for at 3.45 (Also its way cheaper then other leading brands of oil filters for the time being)is a very good bargain.
1,"A classic collection of short stories and flash fiction from one of the original kings of the Bizarroverse. Wilson is weirder than you. His stories are very surreal, very stream-of-consciousness, and, ultimately, very necessary. So just do it. This is one of the first five books anyone with an interest in Bizarro should buy."
1,"I have been a long-time fan of Karyn White since she made her chart debut in the late 80's and I was delighted when I finally managed to get my hands on this rare release. The album contains tracks from Karen's 3 solo albums, ""Karen White"", ""Ritual of Love"" and ""Make Him Do Right"".Karen White never really ""made it"". Certainly she had considerable success with her first 2 albums, but after that her success level wained. Karen has since gone into performance retirement and enjoys being a full time mother. I was disappointed by some of the non-single album cuts, which had to be used to fill this album out. I would also have liked to have had some new recordings but overall I find this collection satisfying."
1,"This book should really be part of the Thoroughbred series, as it is about Fleet Goddess's sire, Battlecry. Leslie convinces her father to rescue a worthless 5Yo stallion who she believes could do anything. As they over come trials they become closer and closer until the heartbreaking point when Battlecry runs himself literally into the ground to win."
1,"A Mexican musician that from his own perspective of Mexico City managed to give a very urban identity to the pop with his records debÃºt Pop / Street Sound. The record contains a wide range of samplings from the people of our country, mainly from Mexico City. Street vendors, merolicos , street musicians and other characteristic sounds of our country are the real protagonists of the Wakal's record who mixed them with different rhythms and electronic genres."
1,"Saw Clapton interviewed on CBS Sunday Morning on 11/08. Clapton told the interviewer that, as much as he regrets to admit, he just can't do some of those things he used to be able to do on the guitar. More and more, Clapton is truly becoming ""Slowhand."" For the past several of his albums, that really bothered me. He seemed not only to be slowing down (hey, the man's in his sixties) but he also seemed to be writing songs just to fill up space. But, here, on this CD with his friend J. J. Cale as his musical mentor, Clapton's guitar work is stellar. Here, the ""Slowhand"" appelation is certainly appropriate, but there's a feeling here that Clapton has also found a new interest in his own playing. The songs are mostly Cale's and they're great stuff, but what's nice is how fresh and energized and interested Clapton sounds. By the way, have you seen the DVD of Clapton's Crossroad's Guitar Festival; it'll blow you away."
1,"One of my faves by the Riders..The ORIGINAL ""Wah Hoo"" ,is on a collection of 1930's humor and swing from one of the Riders' influences (i'm sure) .. The amazing ..""Hoosier Hot Shots"" ..These guys are /were incredible .. same humor and instrumental versatility .. ""I Like Bananas Because They Have no Bones "", ""From The Indies The The Andes In His Undies"" you get the idea .. .. Check out The Hoosier Hot Shots ..they left us some great music ."
1,You either need a replacement cartridge or not. There is really nothing to review about this product. We like using the lotus sanitizer for cleaning our produce. It really makes it last longer and stay fresher.
1,Excellent land nav. review for the trained navigator. Concise unbiased info regarding the use of GPS with land nav. skills. Highly recommended.
1,"I have practically worn out this CD & pretty much have the DVD memorized. Even if someone is not a Kenny Wayne fan but loves the blues you will enjoy this set as well. But damn, he's hot."
1,"This book replaced an identical book I purchased 48 yrs ago that finally fell apart! The recipe's are wonderful, and each country has it's own chapter. Cooking and eating is never boring with this cookbook, as there is a huge variety to choose from if you are adventursome! You need to correct some of the cooking lengths however, as 50-some years ago they believed in cooking everything to death! We know now we can cook food for less time and it is still perfectly safe! You will love this book!"
1,"This item has worked well and performed perfectly. Not sure anyone sells these anymore, but it is a great item."
1,"I like the skin and the lanyard, but the armband was not very useful. It's bulky and it is not easy to attach or remove.I also had trouble removing and replacing the skin after doing a reset, but I think that is the nature of the beast.If you are looking for a skin for your Zen, this is a good buy. If you want it for the armband, I would look elsewhere.Pat"
1,I love the recipies in this book and the marinara sauce is just amazing (I used Cento San Marzano canned tomatoes and it made a HUGE difference). The history and stories also are great to read. A must have for any Italian cook!
1,"If you're an Italian-American, (or want to cook like one), this is a must have book. It will evoke memories of the wonderful times, sights and aromas of family dining in your neighborhood Italian restaurant. The Italain comfort food recipes, entwined with stories of the Pellegrino family, make this a great read. I know because I own a collection of about 30+ Italian cookbooks."
1,"Counterexamplse can be useful in that when they are reasonably simple, they can strengthen intuition in mathematics. The first one-third (approximately) of Stoyanov's book falls in the ""simple and enlightenin"" category and will prove very useful to the advanced undergraduate probability student. After about the one-third mark, it starts to get too technical and there is a danger of getting lost in the details and loose the big pictore - afterall, the point of counterexamples is to shed light on the boundaries of the big picture."
1,"I say, have the other reviewers been listening to the same artist? What's up with all these comparisons with Tori Amos, Bjork? Although Moscow-born Regina Spektor has been grouped together with the 'anti-folk movement', her music hearks back to those very roots she's supposed to have left. Her Russian-Jewish heritage and her classical training play a major role in her music. Regina's Slavic accent is so thick sometimes I'm wondering whether she exaggerates it on purpose! It would in any case suit the theatricality of her music. For that is another element: her music has more in common with cabaret and chansons than with the confessional ballads of her female contemporaries. In any case, I suggest that certain people return to their stereos and give Regina's music another listen before making and Joni Mitchell comparisons."
1,"As other people have said they may not compete with $100 priced heaphones, but the sound is great. I am a big guy and do not have trouble keep the buds in my ear all day. To me they are very combfortable. They produce very good sound. They do not eliminate outside noise. I need this because I need to hear outside sounds."
1,"Though this game can be played with kids, it is a lot more fun when you can get right down and dirty in the gore factor with adults. :)"
1,"Though I haven't read this book yet, I am very happy with the quality and fast shipping. Holding on to this and the rest of the series for my vacation."
1,"The bad part (but not too bad) of The Private Matter is the plot. It felt a bit on the thin side with too little mystery. But in all fairness, this is compared to the Outlander novels. The good part is the atmosphere and detail. Diana Gabaldon is brilliant at this as always, and the 18th century gay London underground is no small task. The best part of the novel is Lord John. I've adored this character since his first appearance. He might be better served by a stronger antagonist/ally. Claire and Brianna did this so well in the middle Outlander novels, that none of the characters here hold up as well in the role.Still, I devored the book in one sitting, and anxiously await another. Nothing would make me happier than a Lord John series. Three and half stars is what I want to rate it at, but am giving four in the hope of encouraging more Lord John novels."
1,"In this movie Kimberly Williams-Paisley, Patrick Dempsay and Brad Rowe star in the romance comedy Lucky 7. This movie is about a young women named Amy Myer (Kimberly Williams-Paisley) who losted her mother when she was seven years old. Before her mother died she gave Amy a timeline for her life. On the timeline her mother wrote she should go to summer camp, Law School and date five guys before she meets the one number 7. After the fifth guy dumps her she meets Daniel (Brad Rowe) at a coffee shop. She really wants to marry Daniel but she wants to also honor her mothers wishes. Amy gets invited to a wedding by Pete Connor, a local bagel shop owner (Patrick Demsey)she tries to make Pete her number 6th boyfriend so Daniel could be the one she marries. Watch the movie to see each guy Amy ends up with. Enjoy everyone!"
1,"A really good movie, which must have come into movie theaters so fast, and gone out again, because I'd never heard of it before I took a chance and bought it. Very enjoyable, easy on the eyes, nice for an evening in, in bad weather."
1,"A very involving and moving piece of graphic fiction. Highly, highly recommended. I find only two things hard to swallow: (1) none of the black characters are homophobic; (2) none of the gay characters are racist. Wishful thinking."
1,this is an amazing album! I put it in my cd player and tripped. it's absolutely totally new. if you liked their single 'these are the days' then you should buy this album. you won't be dissappointed =)
1,"DuBrul and Cussler Together! What a great read! A great thriller/adventure and what else could you expect when you team up two of the best living thriller writers? Ok its not perfect. It is a bit comic book, but that's to be expected, and a lot of the dialog is cheesy, but over all its an exciting read-much better than other Cussler collaborations. The story involves the Oregon, a top secrete spy ship captained by Juan Cabrillo that is funded by ""High Powered"" Western interests. Cabrillo and his crew are after a band of modern day Pirates. Commercial freighters are disappearing, N Korea is selling missiles to Syria, the US wants to destroy a commercial ship suspected of carrying a bomb, and oh yeah the world is being threatened by the release of typhoid and cholera-and this is just the start of things! The ending is predictable but this is made up for by the fast pace and the furious action!"
1,Once again Clive Cussler keeps you on your toes through out the book right to the endAnother great read
1,"for all of you fans and soon to be fans this is typical of all of his works brings you a little history and geology lesson while keeping you in the ""on the edge of your seat"" suspense. it touches on the problems that most of us do not even think about he make you think while also entertaining. hope you enjoy"
1,"Same old good story, Cabrillo is a favorite character of mine. The whole tramp steamer premise is good for all kinds of escapades and this one does not disappoint. If you have read these stories, some of the dialogue seems repetitive but is helpful to a first time reader of these great adventures."
1,"I will admit that I was drawn to this memoir because of it's sort of sensational subject matter-- girl-girl obsession in SF! But I was pleased to find the writing to be absolutely lovely. I often found myself lingering over sentences, wishing I had written them.I will agree with the other reviews that there seems to be a mote of self-pity in this story, but I would guess that would come with the territory of such a story.And, as always, I am often suprised how people who live in such diverse cities manage to have so little contact with people of color. (I call it the Seinfield/Friends epidimic.) There are two African Americans in this story: one is an abusive drug addict (male) whom Kraus encounters in a night club (scaaary black man!) and the other is a sort of nurturing HIV-positive charity case who spouts wisdom and calls people ""child."""
1,"It is very pleasing to see this book back in print.I picked up my copy circa 1980 and it remains myfavorite book on the mathematics of gambling. Why?It is mathematically rigorous, it is comprehensiveand yet it manages to be very readable and evenentertaining. It assumes a familiarity withelementary probability theory. Anyone who isalready familiar with the first few chapters ofFeller volume I can easily understand the theoryin this book. And those who don't can still understandthe strategies and be entertained by the author'sgambling stories. Epstein's book is also very good(my second favorite)and more encyclopaedic and haslots and lots of data tables but Wilson is the bestplace to start."
1,Less about the end of the earth than what we should be doing to appreciate it. This well-conceptualized documentary blends Native American and environmentalist sensibilities to give a sobering but real look at the evolution and possible future of our planet.
1,"Anyone wanting to discover themselves will want this book as permanent part of their library. Krishnamurti guides you to find your truth and not the truth of others. It will stimulate your quest for life's meaning. It provides discussion on why there are no authorities on life. It is powerfully insightful and will ignite your quest personal growth. As a comparison to this expanded and open philosophy, I recommend reading Eric Hoffer's ""The True Believer"", then you determine your truth."
1,Good quality TV for the money.Nice picture and user friendly controls and remote.DVD player produces a nice picture.Still a bit bulky unit but it's a tube TV.
1,"I did not purchase this item on Amazon though I wish I did. I could have gotten a much better price here. I really like this player. Set up is excellent, set up is very straightforward. I was a little disappointed that with such a unit they don't include and HDMI and an Optical cable. They give you cables that you would not even be able to view the HD portion of this player. Also I wish they engineers for these Home Theater component companies would realize we watch movies in the dark so by supplying a player with a remote that is not back lit is disappointing. But I do highly recommend this player. Also you should check out the A30 & A35 which are newer versions. You will not be disappointed."
1,"I just got this last week, and I've been surprised at how easy it's been to deal with. I plugged the HDMI cable (not included in the box, which is a shame, but I bought one with Amazon's deal for a good price) into my Sharp Aquos 42"" LCD, and the optical cable into my stereo, and that was pretty much it. The unit fired up, it delivers a gorgeous picture with great sound, and that's really all there is to it. The only trouble I had was trying to connect it to the internet, but that was because I was setting up a wifi connection; if I'd just had an ethernet cable to plug into the back it would've been simple. All in all, it's dead simple to use, delivers exactly as promised, and is at a price point that may just bring it into the reach of a lot of people like me who were on the fence for so long."
1,I love the menu navigation and the ease of operation. Video and sound quality are the best ever!
1,"Toshiba has set new MSRPs for both the HD-A2 and the HD-20 decreasing both by $100.00, making them $299.99 and $399.99 respectively. If Amazon keeps their discounts anywhere from 20-30% off the MSRP, then waiting will definitely be worth it."
1,"While no Cowboy Junkies album will ever top Trinity Sessions, I think this one comes very close. Yes, the album is more ""produced"" than there others, but done so in a good way. John Leckie's beautiful production work only adds to the atmosphere of this gorgeous album. As always Margo's voice is absolutely beatiful, and the lyrics are just amazing. Best song: ""Someone Out There"" The lyrics to this song tell me that this person is angry with God about taking a loved one away from them, I think this a very natural thing that everyone experiences when they lose someone. Other worthy songs: ""No Birds Today"", ""Darkling Days"", and the title track."
1,"I liked this album a whole lot. Judging from the reactions of some long-time CJ fans, it is perhaps a good thing that this is the first time the Junkies have appeared on my radar screen. It seems that this CD represents a stylistic shift that has left some of their core following scratching their heads. The first half of the album is very strong, and a few of the songs, including the title cut, are what I'd call instant classics. ""Blue Guitar"" is hauntingly beautiful. Most of the way through, the Junkies relax into a cool, sensual groove and lyrical translucence which recall the best moments of Sarah McLaughlin and 10,000 Maniacs. The only real artistic flaw, in my opinion, is ""Someone Out There"" which seems somewhat stilted and facile, and doesn't fit well with the rest of the album. On the whole, however, this is an impressive collection of songs by a group of seasoned professionals at the top of their form."
1,"Great movie........fun to watch! On the edge of my seat the whole time! If you love sexy girls, suspense and thrillers.....you will LOVE this movie!"
1,"...for those uninitiated.From the opening cut (masterfully orchestrated and lengthened by Leon Russell) through the catchy as hell TRIED SO HARD and the tasty interplay of warm '60s country-rock guitar licks galore, capped off by Gene --the Man's!-- poetically-captured romantic blues ups & downs, you'll be royally positively distracted for countless heavenly half hours by this CD and the greatest underrated American singer-songwriter (since John Stewart): Gene Clark... RIP!"
1,"My mother has loved this fragrance since the 1980's and it is getting harder to find. The bottle and packaging are lovely, and the scent is the trademark Pavlova delicate, powdery floral. The price on Amazon is much less than we paid for it at a fine department store twenty years ago!"
1,Here is a 20th century writer giving us a window to theosis. Something to read every day for the rest of your life.
1,"Great picture, gives me a sensation of times gone by. Debbie Reynolds does an excellent job. What happened to movies like this?"
1,I like these strips better than muslin strips because they tend to attach to the wax better and leave less wax to remove again.
1,"Circa 1988 a couple of guys named Mark Long and Marcus Bell formed a group called So and put out this album. The music video for the song ""Are You Sure"" was played on MTV for a couple of weeks and then *poof* was gone. It's a shame really because I thought ""Are You Sure"" was fantastic and I was certain that So would go far, or at least farther than total obscurity. If you're really into very good yet relatively unknown 80's new wave/pop music, then I definitely recommend picking up this CD. ""Are You Sure"" is worth it by itself, and the other songs aren't too bad as well!"
1,"I have been a fan of Jah Wobble from his earliest days in Public Image Limited.So, am I biased to give a review, based on my longterm fascination for this guy's bass playing and selection of talent that have accompanied him over the past 20+ years? No.If anyone has had the pleasure of hearing free-jazz saxophonist Evan Parker live, you were certainly astounded by the tenacity and the skill that he performs with, be it the circular breathing or the range of notes that this man travels with to explore new spaces in sound.I loved the mood and tempo that develops throughout this album and the incorporation of dynamic instrumentation, including goat horns, thai flute, bagpipes, with Jah's Bass and Evan's Tenor Sax.If you enjoy explorations in sound and rhythm, you will treasure this album."
1,A real and touching look at a relationship between two seeming opposites that heals the wounds of a kind but stuck in the past man.
1,"I am 45 years old and have tried many products and this one does work. I am not one to post false reviews and I do not get paid to endorse products-- I am simply a consumer that has had amazing results with this product. I use it daily and over the last several months have successfully watched several brown spots on my face disappear. This is the only product I will use now. I must admit, because of the money I have spent and the many products I have tried with no results, I was not expecting miracles from this one, but this one really DOES WORK and it does deliver results. I am a repeat customer and rate this as the best on the market!"
1,"I started taking the d-mannose in pill form which included cranberry to get rid of my uti...and $60 in pills later, I still had it, though it at least helped so I wasn't strapped to the toilet all day. :) I decided to try the powder, and within 24 hours I knew it had done the job. Unbelievable! I'm not sure what it was about the pills that didn't work...my guess is either the cranberry (though supposed to be good), actually hurt the process (too acidic or something?), or it could be that with the powder I could just keep putting some in my water bottle every time I filled up all day so I always knew there was some d-mannose in my system. Either way, I'm sticking with the powder! I would put 1 teaspoon in 16 oz of water, and drink 5-6 of those a day. It has a *very* slight sweet taste to it at that ratio. It was so nice to not have to do antibiotics this time...So I'm a happy girl :)"
1,"It's too bad that Family Tree Maker has changed hands so frequently that the new management teams feel compelled to ""dum"" down the users. FTM 16 was the pinnacle and they went down hill from there. Why ""upgrade"" with real ""downgrades""? Change should contain improvements not change just for the convenience of company management who is constantly watching the bottom line or is just not familiar with the needs of the consumer. They obviously lost a tremendous amount of market share. My suggestion to FTM is to hire technical people who know genealogy and let them develop the best possible product starting with the FTM 16 platform."
1,"I started using Be about a month before this book was published... and I managed ok. Since reading the Be OS Bible, I now use Be for about 90% of my work, booting into Windows once a day to take care of some stuff for which Be ""isn't quite there yet"".The Be OS Bible does a great job of going through the end-user aspects of the OS, from basic file management and including details on popular applications. A must-read for any Be user."
1,"I love this smell. It's very fresh and clean with a hint of floral. It's a very bright scent, and good if you're ready for energy and something to uplift you."
1,"These 3 discs have been in my heavy rotation since I got them more than 3 months ago. I've owned Willis, Mix Tape #9 and Turbo for awhile, but I was never able to get ahold of the older stuff. This takes care of that... and much much more! I listen to discs 1 and 2 the most, which mainly consist of Piestomp, and the incredible live 'Strapped'. Disc 2 is easily my favorite.Pietasters songs are catchy, upbeat straight up ska. I had several songs stuck firmly in my head after just 2 listens. Check out Freak Show, Dollar Bill, Maggie Mae, and Girl Take it Easy. If you're not singing along, you must be dead.If you're a ska fan, and don't own the first 4 Pietasters releases, you have to buy this now! Seriously. Stop reading and go buy this NOW!!!"
1,AJ Budrys had marvelous insight into what made a good book. This collection of his critiques is instructive both to readers and writers. Glad to have it on our bookshelf.
1,"What I hate most about reading John Sandford's Prey books are the ending! It takes forever for a new one. Can he write faster? I think this series just gets better each time. Is it too early to wonder when the next ""chapter"" of Lucas' life will be written."
1,"I am a practicing mental health therapist. I deal with adults and adolescence that have a history of or are currently dealing with self injury. This book offered some good insight into self injury and treatment options/tips when dealing with a person who self injurers. I was somewhat disappointed in the lengthy explanation of all the disorders. However, I am reading this book from a therapist point of view and not a person who is trying to recover.Overall; I felt this book had some good insight but would have liked more focus on the treatment and outcome rather than the different types of disorders."
1,Pro: I knew the book is excellent because I have read a major portion before purchase. I bought it because it is an excellent reference book for water quality studies. The book is no longer in print but Amazon sold a copy to me in SI unit.Con: Amazon packing is terrible and caused multiple dog ears to my new book. Can Amazon be more professional in the packaging department please.
1,"For those expecting a Metal Church sounding disc, forget it... those looking for a Heavy Metal disc, nope... if you like 70's-80's hard rock like Boston, Triumph, Journey, Deep Purple etc. then you will freak over this disc, I did BIGTIME. Singer Drew Hart's vocal with his sensitive, clear and powerful, yet lilting voice put soul on its progressive melodies, and I really like it. I know it will get no airplay and won't get high in the sales charts which is a total shame, because music this great needs to be brought out to the public.... each song is strong and the performances, production and packaging are excellent!!!Enjoy!"
1,"The book The Cay is by Theadore Taylor. He put so much detail into the book. I am telling you it is fantastic. Every new page has at least one breathtaking moment. I highly recommend the book to all ages. Philip gets stranded on a island with a big black man called Timothy. Philip thinks Timothy is so selfish. Soon Philip learns the kindness of himand in a way they are together. Timothy prepares Philip for the most desperate occasions. Since World War 2 is going on then they probaly will never be saved. If you want to find out what happens, death or life. I read this book so fast it was amazing, fantastic, and a great book."
1,"The Cay is a tragic story about a boy named Phillip who goes blind when the ship he was in sunk. He finds himself on an island with a black man named Timothy. On the island, Phillip becomes fond of Timothy and they become good friends. I would recommend this novel to people of all ages."
1,"The CayI thought at the start of the book this was going to be good. Theodore Taylor was going down the right track with the exciting background,Philip Getting separated from his parents on his way back to Virginia from the town of Willemstad, a town in South America their ship is torpedoed by German U-boats coming because of World War II Philip gets hit on the head and awakens to find that he is on a raft separated from his parents with no one except a cat named Stew-Cat and a West Indian and racially explained ""negro"" (sorry for any racial names)and to top it all off he goes blind! Being stranded on a cay in the middle of nowhere with nothing but a keg of water and stale crackers Philip thinks he is doomed!This book has an exciting start and a heartwarming end, it will keep you wanting to read it over and over again!Preston Amato of elgin"

1,While not his best work it is deffinitely a must read for any fan of C. Moore. Totally entertaining and an enjoyable quick read.
1,"Audio: This was one fun mess. Some of the lines were hysterical. The story is about a little town in California and the crazy folk who live there one horrifying Christmas. It's hard to describe it without giving away the plot. You have Tuck, the pilot who is drug spotting for the DEA, Theo, the pot smoking constable, Molly, the retired warrior princess, and Gabe, the behavioral scientist trying to figure out why men keep coming back to the women who hurt them."
1,"This has quite a few of the top Christmas songs. Unfortunately, there are a few ""filler"" tunes that I skip over, including ""Baby's First Christmas"" and ""Mary's Boy Child"" ... not sure why they were included except that the publishers maybe couldn't get the rights to include Judy Garland's ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" and a few others that are really staples."
1,This CD was just what I was looking for. All of the Christmas songs that I remember when I was little. Thank You
1,"This book is full of ideas and creative situations. It is funny and odd. I enjoyed it thoroughly. It reminds me of William Burroughs, Kurt Vonnegut, Chuck Palahniuk, Anthony Burgess, Steve Aylett, or any off-the-wall author you might think of. But this is not Mellick's best book. I personally like his novellas better. They are short, illustrated, and much more surreal. Though Satan Burger is the best ""punk"" novel I've ever read. It is about a group of punks who live in a world filled with strange races such as midget clones of American presidents, drunken knights, blue women, and violent sex-crazed lizard people. There's also a thing about God closing the gates of Heaven and Satan running a fast food restaurant. I recommend this to anyone who likes Vonnegut or Douglas Adams and happens to be a fan of punk, death metal, goth, or any alternative culture."
1,"A ""closer"" look at mathematics: Book ends where all other books on Mathematics start. With this book, you look at all of basic mathematics much more deeply. It does not help you how to solve specific maths problems, it tells you why were those problems were solved the way they were by the mathematicians.A unique blend of actual mathematics, philosophy, and history of mathematics. It goes well beyond defining 'what' is mathematics; Actual mathematics is there in the book.Example: You know (-1)(-1)=(+1) but never knew that there's 'more' to it -- That it sounds so right yet it doesn't have to be right! With this book, you look at all of basic mathematics much more deeply."
1,"My nine month old son love this CD. Whenever we are in the car and he gets the least bit fussy, I turn Praise Baby on and he settles within seconds. The vocals are in a higher range, perfect for little ears to hear and appreciate. The words are familiar and easy to learn so Mommy can sing along, too. If you want more upbeat songs, try Gregg Nash but for soothing, nothing beats Praise Baby."
1,"This book is powerful and honest. Coming out in the same year as Burroughs' Naked Lunch the two works bear many striking similaruites. Compared to the other works by Kerouac I've read (On the Road, The Dharma Bums and parts of Maggie Cassidy, Subteranean angels) this book seems strikingly different. The work that Jack and Ginsberg did on the Heroin infested Burroughs' scriblings to come up with the powerhouse work, Naked Lunch, must have had a tremendous effect on Jack. This work shares the disragard for the line between fantasy and reality, a compelte self indulgeance of the writer (I can see Jack with his reams of paper, just clacking away, howling with leerie laughter like the Shadow) and a dedication to storytelling and imagination that Naked Lunch displayed. for a whilrwind read fest, try to digest the two in succession."
1,"Curious Eat Themselves is one of a series of novels by Alaskan writer John Straley. This book, like several others, is built around his unlikely detective, Cecil Younger. Younger is a divorced man who is still in love with his wife. He drinks too much and makes some bad decisions. But he has a heart of gold and has a 40ish special needs man living with him.Straley's prose jumps off the page it's so vivid and alive. His descriptive phrases of places and people are three dimensional in the best sense. It's a hard book to put down once you start. And it's a book that bears reading more than once just to admire his use of language. A writer would be hard-pressed not to admire Straley's command of his art."
1,I had to purchase this book for a leadership class I am taking.It was difficult to start but ended well. I learned new things and think about it often. My next step is to create my own brand and this book will help do that. Enjoy!
1,"Midnight Movie is a great film. I thought the acting was very good for today standards, considering all teen actors today seem to just swear and smoke pot in horror films. The killer looked like a smaller, weaker version of Batman villian Bane. The kills in this film were plain and only one i'd consider gory. The plot was simple with a few holes in it. The ending did leave room for a sequel in the near future but I hope they dont make anther film, this was perfect and was only an hour and twenty minutes. Cook up a bag of popcorn and enjoy this well done horror flick.I love horror films that take place in the theaters and if you enjoyed this film, then i'd highly recommend the film Popcorn but thats out of print and might cost alot."
1,"I was not disappointed. Stuart Woods continues to write excellent books, all worthy of becoming a movie. Keep the stories coming!"
1,WILL TEDDY FEY HAS DONE IT AGAIN! THIS GUY IS ONE SMART SLIPPY FELLOW! KEEP READING TO LEARN MORE THIS ONE.
1,This book will give you an inside view of the Modern Jewish Scribe...I loved this book.
1,"I bought my Tag eight years ago and have worn it for scuba diving, skiing, exercising, and eating at top French restaurants. Every two or three years I change the battery; otherwise it needs no attention and has performed flawlessly. The only annoying things with the watch are (i) the bezel is difficult to grip with wet fingers or dive gloves, and (ii) there is insufficient contrast between the dial face and the hands when you're underwater, which makes it difficult sometimes to read the time. These two limitations are a function of the fact it was designed more to be fashionable than functional - but it does function pretty well regardless.Many people (men and women) have commented over the years on how attractive the watch is. I wanted a watch that would be able to go wherever I went and be appropriate regardless of conditions. I also wanted something that wasn't too fussy. The Tag has served me well and I don't envisage replacing it anytime soon."
1,"Amazing pan. Super easy to clean, great grill marks, makes cooking healthy a breeze (grilled veggies come out perfectly). I was between a round and square pan, and part of me thinks a square might be better because it would fit more food. However arguments for more even heating in a round pan are compelling. Jury's still out."
1,"I've always wanted to grill and the other pans I've looked at need a stove top, needless to say I've been very disappointed until I found this grill pan. It's true it does not have really deep grill marks but it does a good job grilling. The size is good and I think it gets even heating. I am very satisfied with it."
1,"Reads more like a novel.Characters, settings, rich history woven expertly ... at times will make you stop reading to comtemplate ... implications ... what is between the lines ... and meditate on such hearts of darkness."
1,"I've had this book lying around the house for some years and an impending trip to Sicily motivated my recent reading. It has a flow and comfort with material that I hadn't felt in Robb's book on Carravagio(which was the reason I'd shelved MIS).Robb was resident of Naples for sufficiently long to know his subject well. Mafia ethos is portrayed in all its gritty and complex shades. For someone well outside the culture and the flood of Sicilian names that, frankly frequently lost me, it was a testament to Robb's narrative grip to sustain me to the conclusion. He's able to evoke the topography, his senses are on green alert, with interest in the cuisines of various cafes, fully related. The note on Sicilian authors, painters and historic events is beautifully interwoven, spaced so as to relieve us of the tedium and intrigue of Sicilian politics."
1,I bought this for my daughters 2nd birthday and she loved it! She loves her doll & plays with him & her Jessie doll as well. This doll so far has lasted pretty well but she is usually very gentle with her toys so I'm hoping it last her a very long time!
1,"This book was excellent. Not only is it reputed as having very accurate historical content, but the ficitonal stories running through it were very interesting as well. It is still hard to believe this was Roberts first writing foray. It is very easy to feel for the characters and want to know how everything turns out. I have to say that their plight was often very difficult - to the point where I was feeling quite cold and hungry myself. I live in Vermont and felt quite badly for them travelling during winter under very harsh conditions without polypropelyne, fleece, or wind-blocking layers. Plus a bunch of power bars for emergencies. I will be getting Roberts other books in this series. I'm sure I will enjoy them as much as Arundel. It is easy to tell Roberts has true writing talent."
1,"""Simply Love"" is another wonderful romantic story by Catherine Anderson. I also loved ""Annie's Song"" and ""Forever After""."
1,"""The White Wolf"", and all the other ""Dragon Pirate"" reading books, are absolute classics. My children have grown up on them, and of all the books they have read in primary (elementary) school, these stories are the ones that have encouraged them to read and enjoy books more than any other series. They are no longer printed, to my knowledge, and must be ought as used books, but if you can get hold of any books in this series, your children are sure to enjoy them. Absolute classics."
1,Nice little reference (134 pages) packed with word roots and their definitions - adds a little poetry to the scientific names we come across in insects and others
1,Great... I'm a big Boston Legal fan and season 2 was a refresher. Always a good show.
1,These are some of the craziest characters I have ever met. With nothing but reruns and stupid game shows on this summer I have been going through about 4 episodes a week. I love the referenes to the actors past and to fact that this is a TV show.
1,"After recently purchasing the Parris Nights cd by Parris Hammond, I actually got goosebumps! This peaceful melody of music has a way of going straight to the sole. Every single song on this cd is truely a masterpiece.I hope to see her live someday on Oprah or other media. I hope it is true that she is recording a new cd. Parris nights is the most moving cd I may have ever heard."
1,"Title says it all. The lights are superfluous, but who cares -- these things scream. If you are lucky enough to find them in stock, Corsair makes this RAM without lights for about $10-$15 cheaper."
1,"I'm new to Chris after seeing him live, solo. He is absolutely captivating live. There's not quite as much magic in the studio recordings but they are still great. The title track is especially nice because he's added very little to it save for some backing vocals which sound more at home with each successive listening. ""Origin of Species"" is one of my all time favorite lyrics. Bottom line is Chris is a wonderful songwriter and a great performer. If you ever get the opportunity to see him live, don't miss it."
1,"i have been a fan of chris smither`s for about 35 years since first hearing cuts on the now long gone radio station WHFS,102.3 in bethesda,md. (D.C. and vicinity listeners from long ago should recall the station affectionately,also.) smither`s guitar playing is a unique and distinctive blend of folk,blues, and country that can only be described as superlative. his songwriting and way with words are unmatched, and comparable to Dylan, in my opinion. my favorite albums are ""don`t it drag on"",""up on the lowdown"", and now this most recent offering to those who can appreciate his talents,""leave the light on""."
1,There can be no dispute that some of Elvis's most memorable performances of the early 1970's were delivered from centre stage at the International Hotel in Las Vegas. This CD features a collection of songs which were specially selected from a series of performances at the Hotel in early 1970.Enjoy!!
1,"Bought for my grandson who was interested in becoming a Navy Seal. However, he did not qualify and is now pursing an engineering career."
1,"I truly enjoyed this book and found it to be invaluable during my twin pregnancy. It is a good resource guide with beautiful photographs; and it is written without the self-righteous tone found in other *holistic-oriented* books. Although I'm not an advocate for the use of the term ""natural"" (which I think is a rather subjective and broad term), I found the suggested complementary therapies for various pregnancy and post partum related conditions extremely helpful."
1,"I like this kettle, but it does need some TLC. It can rust if water is left in it, and it shouldn't be stored on the stove while other cooking is going on since the enamel can rust. It is very good looking and the whistle is nice and loud."
1,I love this teakettle. The weight is perfect. I have a induction stove top and the water boils in less than 2 minutes. Keeps the water hot for tea for over an hour. Great product!!
1,"Mushi-shi is not your action-type anime; no giant robots or sword-wielding ninja or vampires. But I find myself returning to Mushi-shi more than I do the other anime series I own. So many series get placed on the shelf and not visited again except for one or two key episodes once I've watched it through to the end and know how everything turns out. But I return to each episode of Mushi-shi again and again, and find something new to appreciate in it each time. I'm not waiting anxiously for the next volume so I find out who lives/dies or how my favorite character fares: I'm anxiously waiting because this is a series that I enjoy every moment of every episode and enjoy it just as much the fifth time I view it as the first."
1,Extremely interesting and well worth the price. Clear and well recorded and very well written. It arrived after one week instead of the forecasted five weeks. Cassettes are SO practical non having to remember which track I have got to.
1,"This is a truly excellent beginner book. I had never quilted before and have just completed the first project-in four days! I'm so glad I bought this book, and I'm already choosing fabrics for the next project in the book. I have enough confidence now to upgrade it into a bed-size quilt for my daughter."
1,"When I wen to see this one, I thought it would just be another boring skating movie. But I am hapy to inform you that i was wrong. I fell in love with casey and I'm glad that it portrayed a girl being tru to herself and following her dream instead of someone else's dream. also, thank god, it shows a popular girl in the movie that isnt so stereotypical. She's nice and pretty, but having a hard time trying to live her mom's dream. i really liked it and girls of all ages will fall in love with it!!"
1,this is a wonderful movie that makes you want to skate!!! I love this movie because it shows courage and a love for something very important to you.
